    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

I don't demand that you break down for me the supporting ingredients, the amount of panthenol and sodium hyaluronate you include so you can tell me that \"soothing, moisturising\" ingredients are included. I ask only this: if you include an ingredient in the name of your product, tell me how much of that ingredient is in the product.\n\nThis goes out to Mad Hippie, who ignored my message inquiring after the % of vitamin A in their Vitamin A Serum. This goes out to Pixi, who told me that the amount of retinol in their Retinol Eye Cream is a trade secret. This goes out to every Vitamin C Toner that may contain anywhere between 2% and 10% of vitamin C; every definitely-not-blue copper peptide serum; every cica spray with Centella asiatica so far down the ingredients list that it may as well just be water.\n\nDon't make me guess. Don't make me pore over the INCI looking for phenoxyethanol to act as a 1% marker, or go digging through strange blogs in case some influencer's publicity pack told them something that you won't tell me. It's not a problem if there isn't much of the star in there! Maybe I don't want very much! Please, just be honest with me.\n\nCosmetics industry, I have spent so much on you.

I don’t mind that much for my own personal use because I like playing with different skincare products. But, for a client, I want to be able to provide them with proper products, so it just kind of sucks. When brand representatives come in, I usually try to ask about %. Usually they will say they don’t know, and how the brand does not know/will not say how much it is. Or they flat out say they’re not allowed to tell us. When asked why they don’t know or won’t tell us, they say it’s because the brand (usually) believes that the % does not matter. Rather, when in combination with the other ingredients, it will work amazingly. For example: a 5% vitamin C in conjunction with turmeric will work better than a 20% vitamin C. (Just a random example, not saying this is true). So I’m thinking the brands who won’t mention it, USUALLY are pretty low in percentage, or they can’t fully prove the percentage? I don’t know. From a selling perspective, it is a bad choice. Clients always go towards the products with clear percentage. They should consider that.",

        "body": "Someone working in a cosmetics company here: FYI the 1% Phenoxyethanol marker may not be as trustworthy as you think. The regulatory limit in Europe for this is 1%, that doesnt mean companies are actually using at 1%. If formulated correctly, it may only be needed at <0.5%, also depending on the product type and if you have any other preservatives or boosters present in the formula. So although alot of people use this marker to check if an active is above or below 1%, it could actually be present alot lower than this.\n\nThe company i work for are bringing out Vitamin C and Retinol products and I made it clear that if we bring these out, we need to be able to tell the consumers how much of the active will be present. For Vitamin C it will be on pack (10%) and the Retinol we are actually restricted to 0.1% as per market regulations in certain countries we sell in. It's better to be transparent to customers than to pretend its a 'trade secret' or not letting people know because you're worried what they'll think when they find out its present alot lower than we make it out to be. (If it's that low in the product why bother releasing it in my opinion). With actives tho you'll normally see 'clinically/scientifically proven' claims, so we have to do tests to make sure that the percentage we're using actually works. We cant just stick that claim on there as markets will require proof of testing before registering the product there.\n\nI saw a comment about Retinol, Vitamin C as well as hyaluronic acid derivatives: how can you claim it contains 'Retinol/Vit C/'Hyaluronic Acid' when it actually contains the derivatives that are less potent? I have questioned this and unfortunately there doesnt seem to be an regulatory framework around it, so companies can claim what they like as long as you can provide proof that you are using a 'form' of Retinol/Hyaluronic Acid/Vitamin C, etc in the product.",

I've written a post about Retinol a while ago as well:  [Why retinol percentages can be misleading..](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/fr5275/misc_why_retinol_can_be_misleading/)\n\nSome ingredients that can be helpfull to spot the 1% line: Carbomer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic acid (especially when other thickeners like xanthan gum are present, most often <1%), Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Bisabolol (usually <0.5%), Benzyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Peptides, Ceramides, Retinol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (most formulas I see have <1%), Pentaerythrityl Tetra-DI-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Levulinic Acid, to name a few. Very often you just see the standard blends that they've used as well.\n\nNow look at some PC Antioxidant Serums with these 1% line markers in mind, and as a consumer you basically can't say for sure they contain an effective concentration.   \nMany brands also refer with their percentage to a tradename mixture they've added to a formula, not the single active, so for the Inkey List: 2.5% \"Lipo Hyaluronic Acid solution\", 1% \"RetiStar\", 0.5% \"Granactive Retinoid\", their C-50 treatment, with 5% \"Stay C-50\",  I think that's confusing because consumers don't know the composition of these mixtures. Their moisturizer with vitamin B, C and E, they claim the actives control excess oil, brighten skin, sooth redness, I mean look at the ingredient list, seriously there's barely anything in there. \n\nIts annoying that companies try to get the 1% line very high on the ingredient list, then under 1% list the actives first, and make all kinds of claims about these ingredients, while we have no way of verifying wether they are present at an effective concentration. Just list everything from highest to lowest concentration, that would already be much better. I know it's not mandatory for them to disclose percentages, but well if you buy a sunscreen you also want to know wether its SPF10 or SPF50, and the same applies to skincare in my opinion, you want to have some way of telling wether the ingredients are present in an effective concentration.",

Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

I will eventually go through and mark unnoticeable whitecasts with an asterisk, like so: Y*.\n\n* I do not mean to imply that any one ingredient is 'bad' or should be avoided. \n\n* You can sort any category by hovering over the preferred column for the arrow to appear, click the arrow, and then click Sort Sheet A-->Z. \n\n* Reviews and mentions were linked in the order I found them in.\n\n* Prices are very, very approximate, with shipping factored. \n\n* [Request a sunscreen, Contribute Info, Report an Error Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBBpPMhgKUNxhePVzTHADp3kcauErx_6kQnjlqIx1QZQ08Uw/viewform) - If you'd like to add a sunscreen not yet listed, add extra information to an existing entry, *OR* you've found an error you'd like to report, use this form! \n\n\nRight, I think that's everything.

    "body": "I used to post on GOMI analyzing the ingredients of different Glossier formulations and would generally comment on their product releases, but I thought I'd move to reddit for this one since I think it's more helpful here.\n\nMe: I work in the beauty industry on the product development side and because of that I'm constantly testing new products from competitors either just to keep up with the industry or when clients bring them in as comparisons. Recently I came across a product that I thought omg, I need to post this on reddit bc there are a ton of people who would probably want to know this.\n\nThis post will cover the first [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) dupe which is a 99.999% match, is half the price (or usually less) - and the sole difference is that it has a different fragrance.\n\nIf you look up “Glossier Milky Jelly Dupes” the one that is always coming up is the Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser. That one is annoying because is not a real dupe at all; it’s just vaguely texturally similar and has a similar bottle, but the formulation has nearly nothing in common with Milky Jelly in any way. Kind of pointless.\n\nPresenting the last word in Milky Jelly dupes, the [ELF Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9). It is \\*nearly identical in every way\\* to Milky Jelly and is usually on sale for $3. Srsly.\n\nIngredients comparison:\n\nE.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser Ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 184, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, Isohexadecane, Xylitylglucoside, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Vb5), Hydroxyacetophenone, Isopropyl Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Xylitol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThese formulations are nearly identical. They have the same cleansing agents in almost exactly the same order, and even the same textural ingredients. E.L.F. was definitely duplicating the formula exactly when they were formulating.\n\nAs I've said, I've tested the E.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser and the Milky Jelly face wash and they are nearly identical. The texture is bang-on and the use experience is the same. There is just one real difference - the Glossier cleanser uses rosewater as the scent ingredient, and the Bounce Back uses a coconut fragrance. I’m sensitive to fragrances and it doesn’t bother me at all, it’s pretty light.\n\nThe best part? The E.L.F. Bounce Back Milky Jelly dupe is $6.00 for 100ml.\n\n$6.\n\nAnd when I ordered it for testing, it was actually $3 because E.L.F. always has sales.\n\nTo compare, Glossier Milky Jelly is $18.00 for 177ml + shipping.\n\nWhere to buy the Bounce Back: it’s is a little annoying, since they don’t have it in Target, or on Amazon it seems, but you can get it on the ELF website. Here’s the link:\n\n[https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9)\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I don't work for ELF, and never have, and think most of their products are very mediocre. But this one is clearly a copy of something already tested and popular (and I don't feel bad about sharing it because the Glossier Milky Jelly was a total rip-off/copy of the LaRoche Posay Physiological Gel, soooo)",

As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I will say though that there is one part you should seriously consider editing:\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nThis is very incorrect. While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

I have a question regarding\n\n\"Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\"\n\nand\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nI was first prescribed Retin-A at 18 years old. I used it on and off from age 18 to 21. I have been using it consistently (5-7 days per week) from age 21 to 25 (my current age). I now use 0.1% retin-a almost every night and a few months ago I started using TO 30% AHA + 2% BHA once a week. The AHA + BHA makes my skin really smooth and helps with SFs on my nose. It does not cause redness, dryness, or irritation for me. Could I be doing damage to my skin that I can't see? Or is it ok to use as long as I don't see or feel irritation?",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

Has \"great skin moisturising properties\" according to [Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dipropylene-glycol). Safety rating of 1-2 (very safe) on [Cosdna](https://www.cosdna.com/eng/b05d771602.html). This is likely nothing to worry about unless you already know you have a sensitivity, as it is mostly there to keep the formula feeling elegant and seems to be mildly hydrating. \n\n//\n\nHYALURONIC ACID FERMENT FILTRATE \n\nNew kind of hyaluronic acid that Hada Labo claims will \"help fortify the skins moisture barrier to help skin looking plump and supple\". This is the most controversial addition as many people are sensitive to ferments and this product will unfortunately now be unsuitable for them, which is a real shame. However, if you are someone who enjoys ferments, this might sound rather exciting. I couldn't find much info when I searched \"fermented hyaluronic acid\", but Ratzilla's list seems to suggest that the HA has been fermented with Lactococcus bacteria, which is proposed to \"positively influence both the speed and quality of epidermal growth, resulting in better barrier function and overall skin quality\" ([Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactococcus-ferment-lysate)). I'm not convinced a difference in effect will be extremely noticeable alongside the 6 other kinds of HA but I expect it will work well for plumping and improving the health and appearance of the skin regardless. \n\n//\n\nHYDROLIZED SODIUM HYALURONATE \n\nThis is a super, super tiny (low molecular weight) version of hyaluronic acid, which is intended to penetrate even deeper into the skin and moisturise deeper than standard HA. If your skin wasn't bothered by the Hydrolized hyaluronic acid (another smaller molecule form) in the original formula (still in this one too!) then you might well not be bothered by this version too. Source: [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-sodium-hyaluronate)\n\n//\n\nPROPANEDIOL \n\nCommonly used solvent, humectant and emollient. In short, makes formulas more cosmetically elegant and also helps to pull moisture into the skin and keep it there. Considered very safe and a non-irritant. Further reading: [byrdie article](https://www.byrdie.com/propanediol-for-skin-4773491) [paula's choice ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/propanediol.html)\n\n//\n\nCAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID \n\nAn anti-fungal amino acid derived from coconut oil that acts as a preservative. Limited data regarding safety, but Honest Beauty claims it is safer and less harsh than other commonly used preservatives (take this with a grain of salt as Honest Beauty has an agenda to push and so will be biased). Sources: [truth in ageing ](https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/caprylhydroxamic-acid)\n[honest beauty ](https://www.honest.com/blog/wellness/ingredients/what-is-caprylhydroxamic-acid/13775.html)\n\n//\n\nHYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE \n\nUsed as a thickener in cosmetics, gives a nice slippy, gel-like feeling. Water soluble, regarded as safe. \n\n//\n\nXANTHAN GUM \n\nExtremely commonly used thickener and stabiliser. Unlikely to be an issue unless you have a specific sensitivity to it. \n\n\n//\n\nAnd now, let's look at the changes in the top few ingredients: \n\n• The top ingredients, which I usually regard as the most important, have changed in that normal Glycerin has been removed and replaced with Diglycerin, and it's now the 7th ingredient as opposed to the 3rd. Diglycerin is not much different as both are powerful hydrators, but Diglycerin supposedly \"penetrates slower into the skin but gives longer lasting moisture and less sticky, better skin-feel.\" Source: [incidecoder ](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diglycerin) This might be good for people who have tried the original Premium and found it to be too sticky on the skin! However, due to it being moved lower down, the impact might not be too obvious here. \n\n• Pentylene Glycol has been bumped way up the list from 16th to 4th! This is another thickening ingredient that is key to the sensory feeling of the product, and according to incidecoder its also a moisturiser and helps to hydrate and smooth the skin. However, [the derm review ](https://thedermreview.com/pentylene-glycol/) actually claims it doesn't have any specific skin benefits, but is at least safe and non-irritating. I personally would rather have kept a higher concentration of glycerin or diglycerin in the product as opposed to this as I think they're more intensely moisturising/hydrating to the skin. \n\n• On the other hand, urea has been moved from the 5th ingredient to the 3rd, where glycerin was previously. From [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea): \"A derivative of Urea, that works as a strong moisturizer and humectant meaning that it helps the skin to cling onto water and thus to make it hydrated and elastic.\n\nAccording to manufacturer's data,  Hydroxyethyl Urea has a similar moisturizing ability to glycerin (measured at 5%), but it feels nicer on the skin as it is non-sticky and non-tacky and gives a lubricous and moist feeling to the skin.\" \n\nSo, perhaps this formulation could actually remain equally as hydrating, if not more so, but less sticky due to the removal of glycerin? \n\n//\n\nTLDR: \n\nSo, apart from the ferment all the new additions are commonly used ingredients - nothing toxic, irritating or comodegenic! In theory (best case scenario) it should be even more hydrating due to the extra two forms of hyaluronic acid, and potentially less sticky due to the removal of glycerin and higher concentrations of urea and Diglycerin! Worst case scenario is that the concentrations of HA have been lowered and it won't have the same deeply plumping effect, only time will tell. \n\nThis is getting very long and my thumbs are tired so I'm going to end this post here even though I could potentially go on, hopefully this helps some people make an informed decision on whether they'd like to try the new formulation. I personally have already ordered a bottle as I'm not concerned by the addition of ferments and in general it doesn't look bad at all. Fingers crossed it's somehow even better than the original!!",

Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

    "body": "So you’re interested in Asian skincare, but you don’t know where to begin.\n\n##The Philosophy \n\nThere is a lot of buzz around the concept of Asian skincare, and a lot of confusion. Most articles about it focus on the high number of possible steps that an Asian skincare routine can contain, which can be overwhelming for newcomers. \n\nThe Western skincare routine is comparatively simple. It boils down to cleanser and moisturizer. Some people use eye cream and some have a spot treatment. Serums are usually a splurge. Taken individually, each of these products can be great. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to solve all of your skin problems with just one cream and nearly impossible to develop and manufacture a cream to suit every possible combination of skin problems. What if you're struggling with acne and aging? What if you're aging but oily? What if you want to fade dark marks while hydrating very dry skin? Good luck finding a single product that tackles all of these problems while still being at a formulation that works for your skin. Some active ingredients need to be within a specific pH range to work. Others simply don't play well with each other.\n\nThis is where the Asian skincare routine comes in. You know all those toners and essences and serums and ampoules and emulsions you keep hearing about? They act as a vehicle of delivery for different active ingredients to target different issues or to reinforce the treatment of issues. You might have a toner or essence that brightens, with a serum that targets aging, and an emulsion and cream that address redness. The possibilities are endless. That's what makes Asian skincare so effective for so many of us!\n***\n##The Basic Steps\nWhen complete, your Asian skincare routine will be in this order, though you may not necessarily have every step:\n\n* Emulsifying oil cleanser\n* Foaming, milk, gel, powder, or soaping cleanser\n* Chemical exfoliator(s) and/or toner\n* Essence, serums and ampoules\n* Emulsion\n* Lotion\n* Cream\n* Facial oils\n* Sunscreen\n\n***\n##How to build an Asian skincare routine\nWhen it comes to building an Asian skincare routine, there are many different approaches you can take. You can wait until you run out of one of your current Western products, then look for an Asian replacement. The other, which I advocate, is to prioritize your product replacements based on two things: importance and rarity. First look for products that are important to skin health and for which it is difficult to find high quality equivalents in the mainstream Western market. The products below are arranged in that order. And while you're building your daily routine, try out some sheet masks! The instant gratification they offer can't be beat. This is why sheet masks are known as the Gateway Drug to Asian Skincare™.\n\n**Note: To prevent irritation and breakouts, remember to patch test every new product and give yourself 2 weeks to 1 month in between introducing each new product; otherwise you won’t know which product had which effect - positive or negative!**\n\n##Sunscreen\nWhen it comes to protecting  your skin from dark spots, signs of aging, and cancer, sunscreen is the most vital component of your routine. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Western drugstore sunscreens are unpleasant to use, especially at the ¼ Tsp dose that's recommended for full coverage. They tend to be heavy and greasy, with a strong white cast. The Asian market offers a huge selection of affordable, cosmetically elegant sunscreens with high UVA and UVB protection. Start here. For effective protection, look for a sunscreen with high SPF and PA Ratings: at least SPF 30 and PA+++ or higher.\n##Cleansing oil/makeup remover\nNow that you have a good sunscreen, you'll need an effective way to remove it at night, as well as to remove any other makeup you wear. The [double cleanse](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2014/08/skincare-discovery-cleansing-part-i.html) is an integral part of many people's Asian skincare routine. The oil cleansing step breaks up and lifts off sunscreen and makeup so that your foaming cleanser can wash it away and get your skin nice and clean.\n##Essences, serums, and ampoules\nNow it's time for the really fun stuff! Essences, serums, and ampoules will be the primary vehicles for your skincare actives--the ingredients with specific, measurable effects against specific skin troubles--and thus the primary method by which you can customize your skincare routine. They are also where you can really start playing around with interesting ingredients that you won't find at the drugstore.\n\nEssences are usually a watery liquid. Serums and ampoules are thicker and contain more concentrated active ingredients. All types generally deliver some light hydration but are meant to sink in to the skin underneath moisturizing products.\n\n**Here are some popular ingredients and their functions:**\n\n* Vitamin C: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, repairs sun damage, increases collagen production over time.\n* Niacinimide: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, strengthens skin's moisture barrier\n* Snail secretion filtrate/snail mucin/snail goo: Alleviates redness, treats pimples, speeds healing, repairs sun damage, evens skin tone. [Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23652894)\n* Arbutin: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots by blocking the expression of melanin with long term use.\n* Yeast ferment extract/galactomyces/saccharomyces: Brightens, fades sunspots and age spots, evens skin tone, controls cell turnover and oiliness\n* Hyaluronic acid/Sodium hyaluronate: Hydrates by attracting and binding water within the skin\n* Glycerin: Hydrates by attracting and binding water within the skin\n* Salicylic acid: Chemical exfoliant (BHA) for the clearing of pores and treatment of acne; anti-inflammatory. Requires a pH between 3 and 4 to be effective.\n* Glycolic acid: (a type of AHA) Chemical exfoliant for the smoothing of skin's surface and treatment of acne; hydrating. Requires a pH between 3 and 4 to be effective.\n* Hydroquinone: Lightens dark spots. A controversial ingredient, hydroquinone--commonly associated with “skin bleaching” products--is rarely offered in over-the-counter products, except in extremely low concentrations, and you won’t encounter it much in popular Asian skincare lines. Hydroquinone works by inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase by acting as melanocyte cytotoxic inhibitor and by increasing the cytotoxicity of melanocytes.  Arbutin is a gentler and much more common cousin of hydroquinone. \n* Kojic Acid: Also lightens dark spots. Kojic acid lightens the skin by suppressing tyrosiase activity and is commonly used in topical formulations to treat dark spots. Kojic acid has a higher efficacy than arbutin in lightening the skin. (source: Skin Lightening and Depigmenting Agents : Article by Alaina James) \n* Mandelic acid (a type of AHA), a popular option for those who react poorly to the more common AHA options.\n* Starfish extract: Could starfish be the new snail? The preliminary research is promising, showing starfish’s anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, whitening, and wound healing potential. [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2ilph5/move_over_snails_2014_is_the_year_of_the_starfish/) \n\nDon't feel constrained to use only one of each product type at a time. If you have multiple issues to treat, using multiple essences, serums, or ampoules is absolutely acceptable. Just remember to use any pH-dependent products first, and wait around 20-30 minutes before adding more products on top. And don't feel required to use all of these product types if you don't want to. An Asian skincare routine is only as elaborate as you want it to be!\n##Moisturizers\nThe Asian skincare routine offers several options for moisturization  and hydration. Emulsions are thin, liquid lotions that generally provide light hydration. They may be all that an oily skin type needs, while dry skin types often find them useful to add an extra boost under a heavier cream. Creams are thicker and generally more moisturizing. Sleeping packs and sleeping masks are heavier still and serve as the occlusive last step in a normal or dry skin type's nighttime routine. Facial oils can also be used as an occlusive last step, which is particularly helpful for very dry skin, and can also be blended with creams. As with essences, serums, and ampoules, all of these moisturizing options can include different actives to care for different skin problems. Also like essences, serums, and ampoules, you don’t need to use them all if you don't want or need to!\n##Toners\nIt can be difficult to find a Western equivalent to the Asian toner. In Western markets, toners are often astringent and meant to dry up oily skin types, which is usually a no-no in the nurturing Asian skincare philosophy. In contrast, Asian toners are typically hydrating, exist to remove residue, or lower the pH of skin after an alkaline cleanser so that it is more balanced and is ready for acids if you use them, and in general “arrange” the skin after cleansing so that it is ready to receive the optimal benefits from the products that follow. Some contain actives, while others focus on hydration by providing ingredients like hyaluronic acid. Look for one at a pH of 5.5 or below.\n##Other products: Foaming cleansers and chemical exfoliants\nWhen putting together an Asian beauty routine, I generally find it most practical to deal with products like foaming cleansers and chemical exfoliants last. This is because there are perfectly acceptable options for these available in the Western market. For cleansers, look for a [pH](http://snowwhiteandthepear.blogspot.com/2014/09/skincare-discovery-why-ph-of-your.html) around 4 to 5.5.  Our [cleanser pH spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-NtG1u1bp9h83YC2XDfa8Q-XgLB_b_kPi8c9sQW50co/edit#gid=0) can be a good starting point. For chemical exfoliants, look for a pH between 3 and 4. Some other products also have specific pH ranges where they work best, such as Vitamin C, which you can read about in more depth [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/).\nAnd that's about it! If you so choose, there are also a number of clay masks, face scrubs, and other special-occasion options to add in to your routine for an extra oomph.\n##A note on samples\nEveryone's skin is different, making building an Asian skincare routine a process of trial and error. You might think this makes the endeavor prohibitively expensive—and it would be, if you had to purchase full sizes of every product you want to test. Luckily, Korean skincare companies make samples very accessible. Online vendors like TesterKorea and RoseRoseShop sell sample sets and packs of sample sachets for a few dollars each and are often generous with samples when you make purchases. In addition, some people, like me, have built up large collections of samples over time and might just be willing to share them, if you ask nicely.\n***\n##Beginner FAQs\n\n**There are too many steps!  Do I have to start with a full routine to see benefits?**\n\nNo, as I mentioned above in **How to build an Asian skincare routine**, you can start slowly by replacing your western products with Asian ones as you empty them, although sunscreen (especially if you don’t have one or don’t like the one you have) is always a good starting point.\n\n**Snails and starfish?  Hell no, I’m noping right outta here.**\n\nThey’re popular for a reason, but there are many, many popular Asian products that have no \"unusual\" ingredients that you can’t also find in western products, although the Asian formulations are often better and at a lower price point.\n\n**I tried one of the cult products and it broke me out!**\n\nSadly, not everything works the same on everyone.  Many things you just need to explore for yourself, which is why patch testing and staggered introduction of new things is so important.  You can also look at the ingredients on [cosdna](http://cosdna.com/) to start narrowing down what ingredients don’t work for you, so you can avoid them in the future.\n\n**Ok I’m sold, I’m ready to buy X product on amazon/ebay.**  \n\nBeware of fakes.  You can review the Giant List of Sellers from the sidebar link [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/290to0/giant_list_of_websites_ebayers_etc/) for trusted sellers.\n\n**I keep seeing \"whitening\" everywhere- I don’t wanna bleach my face!**\n\nRest assured, whitening **usually** refers to \"brightening\" by fading areas darkened by damage.  It will not change your natural skin tone.\n\n**Show me the science!  Studies  and sources for everything,  or GTFO.**\n\nOne of the great things about the skincare market in Asia is that the consumers are highly discerning, have almost zero brand loyalty, and are always looking for “the next best thing.”  This creates a demand for fast and progressive Research & Development, so companies can release new products and woo customers away from other brands.  This means there’s always something new and exciting being researched, but peer-reviewed studies are a slow and methodical process.  Also, companies want to protect their intellectual property so data is not always immediately released.  There are preliminary studies out there such those linked earlier for snail mucin and starfish extract, which is exciting, but you’re not going to get the same “established proof over 20 years of study” like you are with western ingredients.  That’s part of the fun!\n\n**How do I choose  products?**\n\nWe can only give you pointers. Ultimately, the person who needs to do the research is you.  Figuring out your skin type and what concerns you have you want your routine to help with is a good first step.  You can get an indicator user flair [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2hb3k9/new_feature_update_indicator_flairs_now_available/) which will tell people what your skin type and troubles are, so they can make informed recommendations.  We also have many product resources on the sidebar, so you can look through them for people who have the same skin type and troubles as you.  Researching what works and doesn’t work for your “skin twins” is a great place to start!  \n\nIf you have already looked through the sidebar recommendations and you’re still lost, go ahead and ask your question in the ASK HERE! Daily Help and Questions thread located at the very top of the [/r/AsianBeauty front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/). Make sure to read the posting guidelines at the top of the thread before you post so you can include the kind of information we need to help you better!\n\n**Edit 7/27/16: What should I buy in my first haul???** We've talked a lot in this post about the different types of products to choose from, what they do, and things to take in mind as you begin to put together an AB skincare routine of your own. But it's also important to consider *how* you put together that AB skincare routine! Generally, picking and buying everything in one giant haul is a recipe for disaster, especially if you're fairly new to skincare. It takes time to learn your skin's sensitivities and preferences. For pointers on why your first haul should be a small one, and advice on which products that first haul should contain, please check out [this amazing post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4gltx6/newbies_why_your_first_haul_should_only_have_four/) of first haul tips!\n\nEnjoy your Asian skincare journey!",

I’m just a consumer who cares a little too much about sunscreen because I have a sun allergy. This has been sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks because I feel insecure about publishing this when I’m sure many of you will understand all this much better than I can. I’m also not affiliated with Allie or Kanebo or Kao or even the beauty industry at large in any way.

Kanebo’s [brands](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/brand) include, well, Kanebo, as well as Allie, Kate, and Suisai.\n\nThe Allie brand also has a [Facial Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-facial-gel-n-2020/)^(E) that’s specifically meant for the face, a [milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-perfect-n-2020/)^(E) that’s also for the face and body, and a few tone-up/color-correcting gels, all of which are rated SPF 50+ PA++++. (And a few water resistant makeup products that I admittedly tend to forget about.) They’re currently marketing their color-correcting sunscreens, [Allie Color Tuning UV](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-color-tuning-uv/),^(E) quite heavily as a foundation alternative that also provides UV protection. Aside from the Color Tuning line, which was released on February 16, 2021, all of the current sunscreens were released on February 16, 2020 (2020 formula). The previous version of the Allie gel, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-spf50/)^(E) (without the “N”), was released on February 16, 2018 (2018 formula), and all the presently discontinued formulations released in 2018 and 2019 were also rated SPF 50+ PA++++.\n\nI’ve been using the Allie gel for nearly a decade now, starting with [the second formulation](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-mineral-moist-n/)^(E) released in 2012. [This 2013 article](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/japan-pa-system-for-uva-protection-revised/) from RatzillaCosme reminded me that I picked it up in the first place because it was one of the first sunscreens to be labelled PA++++. I do still try out other sunscreens from time to time, but I always have a tube of the Allie gel open concurrently with anything else I use. I’ve posted about the difference between the 2018 and 2020 formulas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/gkgwm8/sunscreen_kanebo_allie_februaryapril_2020_new/), and reviews of each version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/jmkjlk/japanese_sunscreens_pt_2_allie_extra_uv_gel_n/), with an update to the 2020 review coming up.\n\n# On testing and reformulations\n\nAfter learning about the loophole in Korean law through [Odile Monod’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) (via u/bloominglace’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/)) and [Instagram Highlights](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTA0MjgzMTIwODUyNTQ4?story_media_id=2553999541407826596_1588058418) (via u/FrenchbunnyG’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/gvbbsmz) in the same post), I tried to find information about the laws surrounding SPF/PA testing for reformulated products in Japan (because I live in Japan and therefore use Japanese sunscreens) but kept getting a bunch of hits about testing methods in general, and gave up trying to sift through it all.\n\nThe only product I personally really care about is the Allie gel, so I wrote to Kanebo directly and asked whether they test their reformulated products individually, with the 2018 and 2020 formulas of the Allie gel as an example, or whether their test results are carried over across formulations. Their response as of April 26, 2021 is that they test each version separately (“SPF/PA値の測定に関しまして、それぞれ測定しております”).\n\nI don’t know whether the same goes for all companies in Japan or not, or even for all Kao/Kanebo brands, but that’s one less thing for Allie users to worry about.\n\n*—And after leaving this sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks, I am adding that* u/ysy_heart *has posted* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) *about what the director of Japan Cosmetic Industry Association said about what their guidelines are on this subject.*\n\n# Hong Kong Consumer Council (October 2020)\n\nIn [the October 2020 report by the Hong Kong Consumer Council](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/jj0n81/sun_care_test_report_of_30_sunscreen_products/)^(E/TC) that everyone keeps referring to, the 2018 formula of the Allie gel (as seen in [the photo](https://imgur.com/seDmooL) published with the report) was rated SPF 61.7 PPD 9.8 (PA+++).\n\n*I’ll post a simplified version of [the results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(E/TC) in the comments, mostly for my own convenience.

However, the current standard for SPF testing in Japan is [ISO 24444:2019](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-2:v1:en),^(E) effective as of February 21, 2020 according to [this notice](https://www.jcia.org/user/common/download/business/guideline/spf/SPF-jcia-r020221.pdf)^(J) (linked from [this page](https://www.jcia.org/user/business/guideline/spf)^(J)) issued by the [Japan Cosmetic Industry Association](https://www.jcia.org/en/)^(E) (JCIA)—or maybe it was also accepted before then? JCIA isn’t a government organization, by the way, so I don’t think they can actually enforce anything, but they seem to be in charge of setting industry-wide guidelines and work directly with the government in some capacity. Anyway, the same notice states that ISO 24444:2019 was issued in December 2019. The major changes between the 2010 and 2019 versions are listed in the Foreword of ISO 24444:2019:\n\n>— The definition of the minimal erythema response (MED) criteria has been revised.  \n>\n>— The choice of eligible test subjects is now based solely on individual typology angle (ITA°) with a requirement for the average ITA° for the test panel to be within the range 41° to 55°, with a minimum of three subjects within two of the three ITA° ranges.  \n>\n>— The ITA° is used to define the range of unprotected MED doses for the provisional or the test day unprotected MED determination (if no provisional MEDu determination is made).  \n>\n>— Three new reference standard sunscreens have been validated and added to the method to validate SPF test panels for products with SPF equal to 25 or higher (P5, P6 and P8).  \n>\n>— New test methods are provided to determine the uniformity of the beam of both large and small beam size solar simulators. A requirement for uniformity greater than or equal to 90 % has been added.  \n>\n>— Sunscreen application procedures have been described in greater detail.  \n>\n>— An informative Annex F has been added with photographic examples of erythema responses with guidelines for grading.  \n>\n>— The reporting tables in Annex G) and the requirements in Clause 11 have modified to provide more complete information on the results of the testing.  \n>\n>— The bibliography has been updated.\n\nThe notice from JCIA also lists most of these changes, with a few additional details. They point out for example that the Fitzpatrick skin type is being phased out as criteria for test subjects in favor of individual typology angle (ITA°), which will be relevant later in this post.\n\n*If you have no idea what an “individual typology angle” is (like me), it’s strictly based on skin color and seems much less open to interpretation than the Fitzpatrick skin type criteria. I found* [*this 2013 review article*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjd.12529)*^(PDF)* *in the* British Journal of Dermatology *really informative, though I admittedly have only skimmed through it very quickly.*\n\nIt’s possible that Eurofins just hasn’t updated their website, but I think this is what Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan (Fancl) is talking about in the quote above about the HKCC report using testing methods from 2010. [Fancl Sunguard 50+ Protect UV](https://www.fancl-hk.com/product_details.asp?item_id=5685),^(TC) their product in the report (rated SPF 50+ PA++++ and tested at SPF 14.3 PPD 6.8 or PA++), was apparently released in [2018](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10153767/top)^(J) in Japan, but according to the *South China Morning Post* article, “\\[Ma Chan\\] said that its product went through two rounds of testing by Cantor Research Laboratories in the United States in 2019 and the Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in China in 2017.” (Fancl also seems to point out that their product needs to be shaken before use in [this article](https://beauty.ulifestyle.com.hk/beauty/skincare/20099/fancl防曬-對消委會測試報告表示失望-強調產品完全符合標示-消委會就事件最新回應),^(TC) which could indeed potentially be something that affected the test results. I feel like it’s common knowledge among anyone that’s familiar with milk sunscreens at all, though, and I would hope that any lab conducting these tests would be aware of this. They also seem to say in the same article that any sunscreens that had extremely different test results should be re-tested in more than one lab, which is fair. But keep in mind that I’m reading a machine-translated version of the article for these observations.)\n\nI’m going to ignore the test run in China in 2017 because I believe it would have been following the so-called outdated testing methods, or ISO 24444:2010 (see the section titled “The Chinese version” below). [Cantor Research Laboratories](http://www.cantorlabs.com) basically just has their contact information on the website, so I can’t tell whether they would have conducted their test according to ISO 24444:2019, which would have been possible if the test took place in December. Cantor Research Laboratories was composed of 15 employees and specialized in anti-aging claims [as of 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09419-cover). *(They apparently do testing for Amway, a major MLM company, by the way; try googling* `\"Cantor Research Laboratories\" Amway study`*. —No, I don’t know whether that actally means anything, it’s just something I noticed.)* Eurofins Scientific on the other hand is composed of approximately 50,000 employees in 800 laboratories in 50 countries ([source](https://www.eurofins.com)), though I don’t have numbers for the Australian location specifically. I don’t know whether larger labs would necessarily produce more accurate results, but I would assume they generally wouldn’t be likely to be *less* accurate (or am I completely mistaken?). Interestingly, Dermatest, an Australian lab that was acquired by Eurofins ([source](https://dermatest.com.au)), lists Cantor Research Laboratories among their “Scientific Associates” on [their Links page](https://dermatest.com.au/information/links/). They also cite Cantor Research Laboratories’ Operating Procedure Manual on what appears to be another one of their factsheets, “No. 28 Antiperspirant Efficacy,” published on p. 12 of the February 2017 issue of *The Science of Beauty* (vol. 6 no. 7; [PDF](https://ascc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SOB-Feb2017.pdf)). On Eurofins’ Australian website, they instruct that samples should be sent to “Eurofins Dermatest,” located at the same address on the Dermatest website ([example](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/)), so I’m pretty sure we can think of them as the same entity. Clearly they know of Cantor Research Laboratories, and I wonder what they would say about the discrepancy.\n\nReturning to the *South China Morning Post* article, I assume that “the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians” is in reference to SPF testing, not PA testing, since the latter was *in vitro*. According to Eurofins’ [SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf),^(PDF) their test subjects “consisted of fair skin individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II or III” (p. 3). As mentioned above, ISO 24444:2019 no longer uses Fitzpatrick skin types as criteria for test subjects, so I think we can establish that the SPF results in the report cannot be compared directly with any SPF ratings based on ISO 24444:2019. There are however multiple sunscreens that were released before 2020 and would have been based on ISO 24444:2010.\n\nSo referring back to ISO 24444:2010, according to [this PDF from some time before 2013](https://www.tes-h.co.jp/documents/SPFPFA.pdf)^(J)—but I’m not sure whether it’s after 2010—Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III were part of the criteria for SPF test subjects (and types II, III, and IV for UVAPF). This would definitely be before 2010, but [this paper](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sccj1979/26/3/26_3_207/_article/-char/ja/)^(E/J) published by JCIA in 1992 also specifies Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III for SPF testing. As discussed below, the same goes for China as of 2015. So it seems like the Eurofins test subjects and test subjects in Japan and China (before ISO 24444:2019) would have the same Fitzpatrick Skin types, but Dr. Dray suggests in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGwjKOHq02w) (“Can we trust sunscreen? Korean SPF controversies,” April 30, 2021) that test subjects in different regions are likely to be skewed toward different skin tones. This is just speculation, but maybe it’s possible that more of the test subjects in Japan and China could have been types II and III, for instance, and more of the test subjects for the HKCC report could have been types I and II. (I’m guessing that this is what Professor Cheung means when he says that “the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience \\[…\\] given the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin.”) In that case, while we absolutely couldn’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report, perhaps the report’s SPF ratings could possibly be pertinent if you have type I skin. But again, this is entirely speculative.\n\n**PA testing:** The Australian Eurofins website seems to confirm that their UVA tests are performed *in vitro*. I’m assuming they follow the [ISO 24443:2012](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24443:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vitro*), since they have [a factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601373/iso-24443-in-vitro-uvapf.pdf)^(PDF) for that too, linked from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/uva-tests/) on UVAPF testing. (ISO 24443:2012 is also mentioned at the bottom of [the report’s results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(TC) in footnotes 4 and 5, but I gave up on trying to figure out what it actually says.) In Japan, however, UVAPF testing is performed according to the [ISO 24442:2011](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24442:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vivo*). Eurofins themselves state in this factsheet that both the Japanese and Korean markets require *in vivo* testing, which they also point out is much more expensive than *in vitro* testing (p. 1). They also state that UVAPF ratings determined by these tests are considered **estimates** of Boots Star, FDA Broad Spectrum,\\* and JCIA UVAPF (= what most of us know as PA) ratings (p. 2).\n\n*\\* The FDA website says in vitro testing is accepted in accordance with* [*21 CFR 201.327(j)*](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b97fda59bb83d2742a276a215cdc115e&mc=true&node=se21.4.201_1327&rgn=div8)*, which I didn’t have the energy to actually read and am assuming is the same thing as Eurofins’ factsheet on* [*FDA Broad Spectrum Testing*](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601376/fda-broad-spectrum.pdf).*^(PDF)* *They say it’s based on ISO 24443:2012 but with “differing film thickness and pre-irradiation requirements” (p. 1).*\n\nIf the UVAPF testing for the HKCC report was indeed in accordance with ISO 24443:2012, I wouldn’t discredit the results entirely—but again, I’m not an expert. While we can’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report (same as the SPF ratings), it seems to me that the PPD ratings they give in the report could potentially be used to make comparisons with sunscreens from other countries where UVAPF ratings are also determined in accordance with the *in vitro* ISO 24443:2012 protocol, or at least with other results within the same report (though we would still have to keep in mind that “results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive”). Eurofins’ own factsheet suggests that ISO 24443:2012 is accepted in Australia, New Zealand, and the EU, but I haven’t done any research to back this up, and we have already seen that their factsheets might be outdated.\n\nThe next versions of [ISO 24442](https://www.iso.org/standard/75496.html)^(E) and [ISO 24443](https://www.iso.org/standard/75059.html)^(E) are about 40% through their respective development processes, by the way, so that’s something to keep an eye on if you’re looking into this stuff.\n\n**EDIT:** u/lovethewayyoulick has posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gycvnq4/) about the formulation of Allie sunscreens, specifically regarding Kao/Kanebo’s proprietary “[ADVAN Technology](https://www.kao.com/jp/skincare/surface/surface-02/),\" the name ADVAN coming from “Anti-Damaging uV-A Network.” In a nutshell, their sunscreens are designed to work with sebum to provide higher UVA protection, which would not be reproducible with standard *in vitro* testing. It also seems to explain why Allie sunscreens don't always do too well in casual experiments using light-sensitive materials (as I discuss in the section I had to delete for length posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyc9sqv/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I’m now also thinking of other Japanese sunscreens that claim to work with different factors to increase their protection. Shiseido’s [Anessa](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/about/) sunscreens, for instance, advertise their “Thermo-Booster Technology” to work with heat and “Aqua-Booster Technology” to work with sweat and water. These product-specific factors may not necessarily be taken into account in third party testing.\n\n**Other possible issues:** Even after looking into all this (without actually reading all the publicly available details in each ISO… sorry, that’s beyond my mental capacity right now), I still don’t know whether the difference between the testing methods would really explain the larger disparities in the SPF results, like the Fancl sunscreen. I’ve seen some of you make a very good point that how old the bottle used for the test is (and I would assume things like storage conditions; last summer was a particularly hot one, and some supplements I ordered from the US arrived practically melted together in the bottle) or even the specific batch could potentially affect test results, too.\n\nFor more information about the actual testing methods, see [\\[Discussion\\]How SPF and PA are measured in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mqysux/discussionhow_spf_and_pa_are_measured_in_japan/) by u/ysy_heart. (I want to note that the SPF testing methods described here are based on ISO 24444:2010 and have technically been phased out, but it seems general enough to be at least mostly applicable for ISO 24444:2019, too.)\n\n*—Phew, that was long! I keep seeing this report being mentioned, so I wanted to try my best to do my due diligence. I don’t have a background in science, though, and it’s my first time even actually looking at ISOs, so I’m sorry if I’m completely off.*\n\n# National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan (May 2020)\n\nIn another [report by the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/)^(E) published in May 2020, either the 2018 formula or the 2020 formula of the Allie gel (unclear) was confirmed to be SPF 50+ PA++++ in two out of two tests using a spectrophotometer, though I’m honestly skeptical of the general accuracy of these tests, seeing how four sunscreens claiming to be SPF 30–35 tested consistently at SPF 50+. I guess Japanese companies *could* plausibly be motivated to label their products with lower ratings than what they actually are, since many consumers here believe that high-SPF products are rough on your skin and can actively seek lower-SPF products for daily use, but as an amateur, it seems like it would be easier to actually make a low-SPF product if that’s what you want to sell.\n\nAgain, these tests were performed with an *entirely* different method, and I imagine their results can only be used to draw comparisons with other results in this same report, if anything at all. (For more information on the testing method, see u/ysy_heart’s research and thoughts in the link for the report.)  If there’s so much hubbub about the testing methods in the HKCC report, I’m sure testing with a spectrophotometer would be even further off. I want to give the NCACJ credit for at least running each test twice instead of just doing it once and being done with it, but I also don’t know whether running the spectrophotometer tests even a hundred times would necessarily be credible.\n\nAlso, although the HKCC report seems to have product name errors too (I’ll cut them some slack because they’re dealing with products from other countries, and the photo helps with product identification), I can definitively say that the report the NCACJ published has [some mistakes and ambiguities](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/gvsj5eh).^(E) This doesn’t necessarily mean that the tests themselves are equally faulty, but it does make me wary of any other potential mistakes in printing the test results.\n\n# The Chinese version\n\nThe Allie gel is also rated SPF 50+ PA++++ [in China](https://allie.cn)^(SC) (and SPF 45 PA++++ after being immersed in water according to [their official TMall page](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a212k0.12153887.0.0.1a67687dAgrr3k&id=596686898582),^(SC) if I’m interpreting “浴后防晒指数” correctly), where they require testing at National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) accredited labs in China, as well as additional *in vivo* testing ([source](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2019/08/19/Sunscreen-regulations-in-the-world-from-European-Union-USA-Canada-to-China)^(E)). The NMPA-approved testing methods seem to be detailed in [this 11 MB PDF](https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/directory/web/nmpa/images/MjAxNcTqtdoyNji6xbmruOa4vbz+LnBkZg==.pdf)^(SC) of their Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics (2015), SPF testing from p. 546 and PA or PFA testing from p. 554. I’ve given up on trying to decipher everything, but it appears that their SPF testing either follows or is based on ISO 24444:2010 (so it might have been updated by now), using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III, and their PA testing either follows or is based on ISO 24442:2011, using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV.\n\nInitially I was satisfied in thinking of this as another separate test performed on the Allie gel, but then it occurred to me that I don’t know whether the Chinese version has the same formulation as the Japanese version or not, though I assume they would at least be very similar. [Based on the packaging](https://imgur.com/a/WbH2gAS),^(E) I’m guessing that the current version there is basically equivalent to Allie Extra UV Gel (the 2018 formula in Japan). [This page](https://www.jeebei.com/pingce/hufupin/ql1z6.html) lists the ingredients as follows:\n\n> 水，乙醇，氧化锌，三乙氧基辛基硅烷，甲氧基肉桂酸乙基己酯，丁羟甲苯，甘油三（乙基己酸）酯，异壬酸异壬酯，丙烯酸钠/丙烯酰二甲基牛磺酸钠共聚物，异十六烷，聚山梨醇酯-80，丁二醇，甘油，双-乙基己氧苯酚甲氧苯基三嗪，乙基己基三嗪酮，聚二甲基硅氧烷，黄原胶，EDTA 二钠，水解胶原，苯氧乙醇，透明质酸钠\n\nThis translates to:\n\n> Water, Ethanol, Zinc Oxide, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BHT, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\nThis is the ingredient list for the Japanese 2018 formula, according to the packaging of a tube I bought in a major drugstore in Japan:\n\n> Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethanol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen\n\n*Both are my own translations and I don’t have a background in chemistry. Also, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate = Octinoxate, Ethylhexyl Triazone = Uvinul T 150, and Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine = Tinosorb S.*\n\nObviously, the order of the ingredients differ, but I don’t know whether China has the same rules about the order of the ingredients or not. One definitively different point, though, is that the Chinese version contains Phenoxyethanol and the Japanese version doesn’t. So while I can’t say how different or similar the two versions might be, it’s clear that they aren’t exactly the same.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that the [Bioré UV Athlizm essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-athlizm-skin-protect-essence/)^(E) and the [Bioré UV Aqua Rich gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-gel-2019/)^(E) and [essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-2019/)^(E) are all rated SPF 50+ PA+++ [in China](https://www.kao.com/cn/products/biore/),^(SC) and not SPF 50+ PA++++ as they are rated in Japan, but since they are sold ~~(and possibly manufactured)~~ locally by Kao (China) Holding Co., Ltd. rather than as import products from Japan, you would have to consider the possibility that they may not necessarily have the same formulation as the Japanese equivalents.\n\n**EDIT:** I’ve just figured out that the Chinese versions of the Allie gel and Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence are made in Japan with different formulations specifically for the Chinese market. See links re: each product [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu).\n\nSimilarly, RatzillaCosme says in a comment on [this page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-gel-spf50-4-plus/) that “Rohto products that are marketed for outside of Japan have different ingredients/formulas than Japan’s and they’re not Japan-made (despite the Japanese printed). If the Japanese version is what you want, both the packaging and product name need to be exactly the same as what \\[is\\] shown in my site.” They also say in a comment [here](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-essence-2020/) in response to an inquiry about [Sunplay Skin Aqua](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/index.shtml) Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ (I’m not sure but possibly [this](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-75.shtml)^(SC)), “That product isn’t Japanese — it’s made in China by a different company. It isn’t produced by Rohto Pharmaceutical in Japan.” (Credit goes to someone on this sub for mentioning that Ratzilla talks about this in their comments section. I’m sorry I can’t remember who it was.) Going back to the HKCC report, the results table says that [Sunplay Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-72.shtml)^(SC) is manufactured in China (in addition to the “Sunplay” in the product name already being a giveaway; in Japan, [Mentholatum Sunplay](https://jp.rohto.com/uv-sunplay/) is a separate Rohto brand alongside Skin Aqua, so “Sunplay Skin Aqua” doesn’t exist), so the results in the report would not necessarily be applicable for the Japanese product, not to mention the other concerns I discussed.\n\nSo the situation arises where there are products that aren’t “fake” but also aren’t exactly the same thing as what’s sold in Japan, kind of like how the American versions of LRP sunscreens wouldn't contain their more advanced filters (which is probably more drastic of a difference than what I’m discussing here). This might be especially important for anyone buying the product from non-Japanese vendors. Double check to make sure you’re getting the version you intended to buy—and if you specifically wanted the non-Japanese version, that’s great too. Like [the American and Japanese Curél Intensive Moisture Creams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/labr3m/difference_between_japanese_and_american_version/), it’s possible that the end result (the user experience) is pretty much the same anyway, but in the case of sunscreen, make sure you know what the SPF/PA rating is for the exact version you’re buying.\n\n# Using sunscreens from major corporations\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNsoPyo1PjA)^(J) posted on March 26, 2020, skinfluencer Arata Tomori says that SPF testing is usually outsourced to a third party lab, and that PA testing is often performed in-house (I haven’t looked into this). She says that different labs can come up with different results, and based on her own past experience with trying to make a sunscreen (I think she has her own skincare line), she has heard of labs that are actually known to give higher SPF ratings. She recommends that we stick with major corporations that are more likely to be working with labs that would provide accurate results.\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTS0Xd-T97s)^(J) posted on March 28, 2020, cosmetic chemist YouTuber Sumisho discusses issues with SPF ratings in general, with the AMA Laboratories case in the US as an example. He says we should be careful with smaller brands, and advises that it’s a good idea to pick products that are made by major corporations that put a lot into sunscreen R&D. He also advises that products sold in China go through additional testing and could be more reliable, and that you could check Tmall for listings, but I want to add again that you would need to make sure you’re looking at the version you want.\n\nOdile Monod also breaks down the difference between OBM, OEM, and ODM products in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) I mentioned earlier. Although she’s talking about the Korean beauty industry, I think this part probably applies for other countries, too, and she advises that it’s (not necessarily foolproof but) a good idea to pick OBM products that are formulated and manufactured in-house.\n\nAnd now [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) about the response u/ysy_heart got from the JCIA director can be interpreted to back up this approach as well. I’m generally in favor of indie brands in spirit, and usually I would think more about how these people might be benefiting from making these claims, but I do see how major corporations would have a lot more to lose from these sunscreen scandals. I also don’t think I’ve seen companies like Amorepacific (for instance) mentioned in connection with the recent scandal in Korea.\n\nI’m still looking up different sunscreens and who actually manufactures them, but the Kao Group (including Kanebo), the Kosé Group, the Pola Orbis Group, the Rohto Group, and the Shiseido Group are some major Japanese corporations that seem to generally have OBM products. I have a huge spreadsheet in progress that I plan on sharing whenever I think it’s ready, with specific products from these companies (and others) and some properties I wanted to compare.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nIf you’re *really* concerned about the accuracy of SPF/PA ratings, I guess the truly thorough approach would be to look at as many tests as possible. You could either stick with the sunscreens that consistently do well in third party testing (guilty until proven innocent) or avoid those that consistently do poorly (innocent until proven guilty).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it just isn’t realistic, especially considering how frequently Japanese sunscreens are reformulated. A test result from last year might not be applicable for a product that was reformulated this year. You would have to make sure where the product tested was manufactured and what year it was released, and then there are the potential issues with storage conditions and different batches, etc. Also, “real” testing is expensive, and it’s not all that likely that there would be multiple credible third party tests following official protocols performed on the same formulation.\n\nAs Professor Tong says in the *South China Morning Post* article, we should probably accept that no single test is going to be an absolutely definitive one. Personally, with regard to what I’m already using, if it’s keeping my sun allergy symptoms from showing up, that’s good enough for me—but I guess you could say that I have the advantage (?) of my face being a hypersensitive UV meter of sorts. As for any products I might try in the future, I’m going to keep trusting the ratings as they are claimed unless there’s a scandal specifically involving that product. We *are* already taking a kind of leap of faith in trusting that the product is otherwise safe to use and that the ingredient list is correct and so on. And regardless of any tests results, even good ones, I would make sure to apply plenty, to reapply, and to avoid relying on sunscreen alone, especially if I’m going to be outside for an extended amount of time.",

I’ve been living in Japan for over 10 years, and am under the impression that the general consensus among Japanese consumers is that you use either Anessa or Allie if you don’t want to tan/burn, Anessa being top-level protection and Allie coming in second while also being easier on your skin. (This seems to specifically be based on Anessa’s [flagship milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/anessa-perfect-uv-sunscreen-skincare-milk-a-2020/)^(E) and Allie’s gel products, even though Anessa also has gels and Allie also has a milk.)\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean they’re absolutely the best sunscreens in the entire Japanese market, of course—the products discussed on this sub represent just a small fraction of all the sunscreens available in Japan—nor do I know how they would really compare with European sunscreens (which I’ve never used, aside from a couple of Asia/Australia-specific LRP products), but it does suggest that they must at least be among the best that are commonly available in drugstores nationwide.\n\nAllie sunscreens seem to do well in those completely unscientific experiment memes where people apply a ton of different sunscreens on their backs and lay out in the sun:\n\n|**Video/Article**|**Sunscreens and UV source**|**Conclusion**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sunameri for Kakaku.com, [人気の日焼け止め10種を徹底比較！ 日サロで肌を焼いて効果を確かめてみた](https://kakakumag.com/houseware/?id=11834), January 14, 2019|10 sunscreens including Allie Extra UV Gel (2018 formula);

I always got a little worried about these reports coming out about my beloved Allie sunscreen, but I feel confident about it now. I went to the sunny beaches Australia, Okinawa, Thailand, and Hawaii with my Allie sunscreen and I've never gotten a bad tan! Granted, I was wearing sunglasses, a hat, and occasionally a sun umbrella but I think that proves your final thoughts - apply plenty and reapply, reapply, reapply!",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

Anyway, Biore claims that these products stay on evenly in severely hot and humid weather. This gets me very excited as I live in a very hot and humid area (75% - 85% and 30°C to 37°C during day time) so I would like to test this ~~or these~~ as soon as I get my hands on them. Will be sold from 9th February 2019 in-store with limited availability on Japanese online stores at an earlier date priced at [1944 JPY RRP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?__mk_ja_JP=カタカナ&url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&field-keywords=ビオレ+UV+アスリズム+スキンプロテクト). ~~internal cries and gasp~~ but to be fair it has more grammes. \n\n**Ingredients**:\n\n~~Again, hasn't been released but mentioned:~~\n\n* ~~Hyaluronic Acid, Royal Jelly extract, and Butelyne Glycol (moisturising ingredients).~~\n* ~~White floral scent (made from natural fragrances), Citrus, Musky Wood.~~\n\nEssence: \n\nWater, ethanol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl triazone, isopropyl palmitate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), hydrogenated polyisobutene, sodium acrylates copolymer, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), dextrin palmitate, BG, (acrylates / C10-30 alkyl acrylate) crosspolymer, alkyl benzoate (C12-15), glycerin, propanediol, potassium hydroxide, glyceryl behenate, hydroxyethylcellulose, (vinyl dimethicone / methicone silsesquioxane) crosspolymer,  pullulan,  cetyl alcohol , sorbitan distearate, stearoyl glutamic acid, arginine, EDTA-2Na,BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronic acid, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\nMilk: \n\nCyclopentasiloxane, zinc oxide, ethanol, water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, dimethicone, hydrogenated polyisobutene, isopropyl palmitate, talc, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), titanium oxide, alkyl (C30-45) dimethylsilyl polypropylsilsesquioxane, polymethylsilsesquioxane, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), Butelyne Glycol, PEG-12 dimethicone, triethoxycaprilsilane, PEG-3 dimethicone, Aluminium hydroxide, stearic acid, methicone, BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\n**So, what are their claims?**\n\n* **Unique durable \"Tough Boost\" technology:**\n   * Supposedly stays on skin even during hot and humid conditions of 40°C and 75% humidity even when skin perspires or sweats.\n   * Super waterproof which lasts 80 minutes through water resistance tests but easily cleansed.\n   * Usable as a makeup base (so...white cast? primer?)\n* **Two versions**:\n   * Water-based essence (70 g): fresh and moist feeling that leaves the skin with a smooth sensation.\n   * Oil-based milk (65 ml): silky touch that glides on the skin with a light-weight sensation, no stickiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ii2mnvhve8621.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3215d1e3ed7e8e9b5eabc5a3b78bcdbe9f3553f6\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Biore UV SaraSara Line (so, Perfect Milk, Bright Milk, Face Milk and Spray) is repackaged but no reformulation. Only the cardboard packagings seem to change to my eyes.\n\n[Here if you want to see the complete list of Biore UV lines (in Japanese).](https://www.kao.co.jp/bioreuv/itemcheck/) On the table there are star ratings. The first one is its suitability for children and the second is how well it interacts with makeup (whether makeup slip or not).",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "amidst of all the costly products and brands that I use, a substantial amount of products in my routine are indian pharmacy grade and are just so gooodddd for the price point (also cuz my 17 yr old ass is broke duh!). all of them are under 500 so if you're low on budget and your skin type suits it, then do give these a try!\n\nill not be mentioning prescription products in this list. some of them have been suggested by my dermat but rest assured, I made sure all of them are OTC and do not require specific prescription, so you can get them easily! purchase status and ratings mentioned alongside.\n\nlets goooo\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w5vydp9jf9e91.jpg?width=496&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25bdc6beb08335f25119acba69c230b688abfb60\n\n**preliminary info**\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated, acne prone and dull\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads, blemishes and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**🐹Kojic cream**\n\n**pharma** : curatio\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 350 for 20g (available on discount at 1 mg)\n\nprobably one of the best beginner creams for those who want to give kojic acid a try. although there are creams which have less than 1% of kojic acid (this one has 2%), I think this works much better and than low conc. ones. also has PAD and lactokine so ideal for sensitive and acne prone skin too. need a little amount to spread it and doesn't feel greasy or oily. this has helped my PIH so much! albeit takes a little while to show, but with continuous use for almost 3 months, there is such a significant difference. also mildly exfoliates and is great for everyday use. post acne marks are so much lighter after use. also used it lighten my under eyes (diluted with moisturizer) and they look bright and healthy now! a really versatile cream with multiple uses. gold standard for beginner friendly hyperpigmentation fix! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **clearz plus**\n\n**pharma** : Dr. Reddy's\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 200 for 15gm\n\nI swear, almost half of the products on this list are related to PIH lmao. but then again, neither k-beauty nor indian cosmeceuticals have ever worked for PIH for me 😭 but anyway, this is a great multi-ingredient product! has 2% kojic acid and 2% vitamin c so it fixes PIH and gives a glow simultaneously! my lazy ass cant bother to apply vit-c in the morning so this has helped out a lot. and the best part it, its matte! so for my oily queens who want a glow and get rid of spots , this ones for you. so hydrating at the same time and not irritating at all. I use this in the morning, alternating with the previously mentioned cream.  and the 15gm tube actually lasts for a while (about 2 months) since the you don't require that much for one application. if you feel the percentage is too much, they also have a clearz version with 0.75% kojic, but I haven't tried it. again another golden standard for PIH! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **Kozimax skin lightening cream**\n\n**pharma** : Ethicare\n\nMrp : Rs. 320 for 15gm . also available in 9gm.\n\nok I swear this is the last kojic acid product on the list lol. this one is a lot more stronger than the other two and I've only used it after building a good tolerance to kojic acid as a whole. has 5% kojic acid, 10% vitamin c , glabridin (knew nothing about this until I got this product), arbutin and octinoxate, which makes it suitable for morning use. despite the name, yall, this was mind-blowing 🤯. results right after 3-4 uses. this was the hidden gem all along 🥲 glabridin was something that intrigued me the most, since its a UV filter and its anti-inflammatory so that a bonus! it didn't aggravate my active acne although I would suggest this only after you have some prior experience with kojic acid. directly using 5% might cause irritation. deffo a staple for my PIH! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **sebogel**\n\n**pharma** : Ethicare\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 240 for 30gm\n\nholy shit! I didn't know this had 6% niacinamide and it dried me the fuck out. but its an absolute HG for pimples that come out like 'surprise motherfucker' lol. the best and fast-acting spot treatment I've ever come across. it also works amazingly for enlarged pores and excess oil product and is also good for contact therapy. didn't really see a difference in blackheads or sebaceous filaments but I think with constant use, the benefits will come in much better. this so much more effective than any other salicylic acid serum I've ever tried. just dries me out a lot . **WRP (4/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **hyalugel plus**\n\n**pharma** : Ethicare\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 350 for 30gm\n\ngot this rec from the sub itself! and it didn't disappoint! I will say the tube packaging made the product end faster since I drench my skin in hyaluronic acid day and night lmao. but this leaves my skin so plump and juicy 🥵. its like someone packed the SNP peptaronic toner and isntree HA plus in a gel base and sold it for cheaper! although none of the HA serums I've used have disappointed me (only one of them has) , this one is such an affordable and easy to get option. one thing is though, it seriously causes the worst dryness if not used on damp skin. still if used properly, this is a boon for all my dehydrated and dry sisters/brothers out there! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **Zitmoist gel**\n\n**pharma** : Canixa Life Sciences\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 350 for 50gm ( available on discount on 1mg)\n\noh.my.god. the best summer gel moisturizer for dry skin?!? although its marketed for oily acne-prone skin , I believe this will work for all skin types. man , such a simple ingredients list and none o them aggravate my acne at all. has allantoin and sodium hyaluronate in aloe vera gel base (in contrast to what their website says. it does not have niacinamide or vitamin e). gives such a good matte finish without drying my skin. deffo suitable for oily skin throughout the year but only in summers for dry ones. this wont do much in the winters. also has a very refreshing and light scent to it although there is no added fragrance! **WRP for summers (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🐹 **Demelan Cream**\n\n**pharma** : Glenmark\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 415 for 20gm (available on discount at 1mg)\n\nthis one is pretty good for extremely textured skin types! has a really high conc. of glycolic acid (10%) and also has arbutin and kojic acid pre-mixed. although it did break me out a bit (aha/glycolic cream forms tend to do that more as compared to serums and toners) it helped me out more in body texture as compared to on the face lol. I have extremely rough ankles and knees and this soften them up real quick along with lacsoft! not to mention, it gives good odor control when used on armpits along with lightening those areas aswell. not sure whether ill use it again on my face tho . **MRP (3/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**🐹 Cerasoft imf**\n\n**pharma** : Grace Derma Healthcare\n\n**Mrp**: Rs.300 for 100gm\n\njumping on the cerasoft whore train with u/Someonesometh1ng lmao. probably the best pharma barrier repair/ dry skin/ atopic skin/bajra roti skin cream ever to exist imo. cuz damn this slaps as hell 🥵 has ceramides, pentavin, HA and other good shit. seriously at par with bioderma baume for me. a bit heavy and greasy for morning summer use for me but this along with aveeno dermexa are probably going to be my favs for winter mornings! nothing but one of my HGs for sure! **WRP (5/5)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's it! hope this was helpful 🥰 I had more recs but I either used them a long time ago or they just didn't work for me. maybe ill make another post later but that's it for now!",

    "body": "Hey! I'm an esthetician with OCD--that means that yes, I'm a skin picker. I'm mostly in recovery--I haven't picked at my face for weeks now! But we all want to heal that awful redness and hyperpigmentation, called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, or PIH, that comes from picking. \n\nFirst off I want to recommend that you wear SUNSCREEN. The sun will make any scarred areas even darker! So I recommend sunscreen daily on your face, and all over your body if you ever spend more than 15 minutes outside. \n\nSecond, I want to recommend you find your holy grail moisturizer to use on the areas that are scarred or have PIH. I personally love First Aid Beauty's Ultra Repair Cream. It's great for face and body, but can be a bit expensive for some people. I recommend anything with ingredients like hyaluronic acid or sodium hyaluronate, which binds moisture to your skin.\n\nThird, a good exfoliant. You want an alpha hydroxyl acid for anywhere that isn't prone to acne (like arms) and a beta hydroxyl acid for anywhere that gets zitty. Paula's Choice has good exfoliating lotions and serums. The Ordinary also has some for a bit cheaper. The Ordinary actually has a 30% AHA/2% BHA peel for around $7-$8. If you have a scarred area, I recommend using it once a week on your face and once or twice a week on other body parts. Note that zitty areas can *purge*--you can break out after using an acid because it brings bacteria and keratin to the surface. Don't freak out, and keep using it regularly--you'll see a difference! CHEMICAL EXFOLIANTS ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO GRITTY PHYSICAL ONES. Remember that the next time you see a scrub at the store. Scrubs are gonna exfoliate your skin very unevenly and irritate it/dry it out. You don't want any of those things for your scarring!\n\nFourth and last is serums. The Ordinary also has great serums at a really cheap price. Holy Snails also has awesome serums with a few more additives, so they're more expensive but worth it. The Ordinary has an azelaic acid cream. Azelaic acid inhibits keratin production, so over time you'll have less acne and keratin filled bumps. The Ordinary and Holy Snails both have niacinamide serums. Niacinamide helps with skin renewal and dark mark fading. Finally, I also recommend alpha arbutin, which is in some HS and The Ordinary products. This one is a safe skin lightener, better than other skin lighteners like hydroquinone. \n\n------------\n\nBrands I recommend in this thread: Holy Snails, The Ordinary, Paula's Choice. Mostly for their affordability. Holy Snails is going to be a little more expensive than the Ordinary, but their serums target multiple things instead of just having one or two key ingredients. PC is slightly more expensive than The Ordinary also, but same goes with them and their ingredients.\n\nYou want to take care of your skin in this order: cleanse. Exfoliate. Serums. Moisturizer. \n\nTake care, you guys. This sub is awesome, and I wanted to contribute to it. Also, check out r/skincareaddiction if you haven't already. I tried to condense most of the info they'd give you into a single post, but I'm sure they have even more helpful hints!",

I’m breaking out to everything bc they’re hiding the niacinamide or the stupid hyaluronic acid variants like sodium hyaluronate somewhere in the goddamn ingredient list\n\nI can’t even get any good drugstore products anymore because bitches want to be trend followers.

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?

This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?

AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

There are a few things I want to clear up before I start:\n\n\\- This is not a post to start drama or to say bad things about Boxycharm OR Faccia Skin. This is simply research on the claims of the product and whether or not there is evidence that these claims are true. I intend to make NO speculations about this and only present the facts as I can find them (and cite them). If I do make any speculations, please call me out for it and I will remove them.\n\n\\- I am not going to tell you whether or not to use this product. This is just the information I think you should have to make an educated decision for yourself.\n\n\\- I have no stake in this product and hope that makes me as unbiased as possible. I don’t receive premium, and I don’t intend to buy. None of what I say here is based on my experience with the product OR any reviews of the product. \n\nFinally, the intention of this is to investigate these claims based on being an “average consumer.” I know that the actual average consumer does not actually do this much research. What I mean by this is that all this information comes from available online databases and resources, and the first couple pages of Google. I’m not doing a deep dive into any Instagram pages or people’s private lives to find this information. I intend for all of it to be easily verifiable by anyone who wants to find it.\n\nI will investigate 4 things about this product: cruelty free claims, safety of ingredients, benefit claims, and retail value.\n\n**Cruelty Free Claims:**\n\nAccording to [Cruelty Free Kitty](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/cruelty-free-101/cruelty-free-bunny-logo/) there are no laws to regulate when a company claims to be cruelty free. However, there are three organizations that have standards to verify a company’s cruelty-free status, and then allow them to use their logo to indicate to consumers that the product has met that set of standards. \n\nFaccia skin uses the PETA “Beauty without Bunnies” logo on their packaging, which means they claim to meet PETA’s standards as a cruelty-free company/product. Also according to Cruelty Free Kitty, if a company uses the logo but does not appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, you CANNOT verify that the product is cruelty-free.\n\nFaccia Skin DOES NOT appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, despite using the logo. According to PETA, in order to use the logo, a company must first be verified as Cruelty-Free by PETA, and THEN is able to pay a one-time $100 licensing fee to use the logos on their products ([PETA](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/info-businesses/beauty-without-bunnies-program/)). That means that if Faccia Skin is using the logo, they should already be on the list despite being a new company. The FAQ also suggests that this list is updated frequently so consumers are always up to date with additions, deletions, and other changes. [PETA FAQ can be found here.](https://features.peta.org/cruelty-free-company-search/index.aspx)\n\n**TL;DR – Faccia Skin’s cruelty-free status cannot be verified.**\n\nNote here: Other research on this sub has suggested that this company is owned by the same owner as DLS cosmetics, which is both PETA and Leaping Bunny certified. They may be licensing the logo legally, but from what I can tell, does not verify the cruelty-free status of this brand specifically. \n\n**Safety of Ingredients:**\n\nThis is the list of ingredients for this moisturizer on Faccia’s website:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, GOLD, HYDROLYZED SERICIN, CARBOMER, BETAINE, TAURINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, NIACINAMIDE, BUTANEDIOL, POLYSORBITULE-20, PALMITOYL OLIGOPEPTIDE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, ACETYL TETRAPEPTIDE-5, ACETYL HEXAPEPTIDE-8, EDTA-2NA, HYDROLYZED PEARL, FUCUS VESICULOSUS EXTRACT, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, PEG-40, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, METHYLPARABEN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DIAZOLIDINYL UREA, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, PARFUM, CI19140\n\nVia SkinCarisma, 8 products on this list have an EWG Health Rating of “Moderate” or “High” risk.\n\nModerate risk:\n\nGold – SkinCarisma identifies this as a “cosmetic colorant” with no benefits\n\nTriethanolamine – This has a comodogenic rating of (2). Incidecoder says that this ingredient is generally safe, but can form carcinogens if it is included in a product with nitra-/nitro- type ingredients. I don’t see any of those ingredients in this list.\n\nMethylparaben – This is a paraben (obviously). There is nothing directly unsafe about using this ingredient. There was a 2006 study that found that skin cells treated with MP had more harmful exposure to sunlight than non-MP treated skin cells. This study was done in a lab and not on actual human skin, so there’s no direct link to this being harmful. When in doubt, wear sunscreen\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea – A preservative, This ingredient is controversial because it belongs to a family of ingredients that may break down into formaldehyde when added to a formula. A 1990 study found that it is safe in concentrations of <0.5%. The evidence on this is unclear, and since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nIodopropynyl Butylcarbamate – Also a preservative. This is safe in concentrations of less than 0.1%, and has an extremely low rate of skin irritation. Since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nHigh Risk:\n\nButane – Incidecoder brings this up as Butanediol, which is a solvent to help products absorb faster. Its safety has not yet been questioned. It’s sometimes used as a food additive. HOWEVER the ingredients list does actually say Butane and not Butanediol which is used as a propellant. It’s still safe but it doesn’t make sense for an ingredient that is not aerosolized.\n\nFragrance – The problem with this ingredient is that “fragrance” is a general term that can be made up of an average of 30-50 chemicals that aren’t required to be disclosed. A lot of products use this term and are still safe, but because all the ingredients are not disclosed, we can’t say for sure. Use your best judgement.\n\nOther:\n\nPolysorbate 20 – listed as a fungal acne trigger, but is an emulsifier and is safe.\n\nYou can find all this information at incidecoder.com and skincarisma.com\n\n**TL;DR : Basic judgement says that this product is safe to use, unless you are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients on this list, react to comedogenic products, or have fungal acne.**\n\n**Benefit Claims:**\n\nOn Faccia Skin’s website, they make the following claims about this product:\n\nHydrate skin – We can expect this result based on moisturizing ingredients (glycerin, betaine, sodium hyaluronate, niacinamide, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, PEG-40, Propylene Glycol)\n\nAnti-aging – SkinCarisma lists Niacinamide as the only anti-aging ingredient.\n\nStrengthen skin – SkinCarisma lists Sodium Hyaluronate as an ingredient to promote would healing. Incidecoder also suggests that there are peptides in the ingredients which act as “cell-communicating” agents. Peptides are fairly common in other products that claim strengthening benefits.\n\nEnhance skin “radiance” – We can expect this based on the ingredient Niacinamide as well as moisturizing ingredients. Skincarisma lists Niacinamide as a “brightening” ingredient.\n\nReduce damaging environmental factors – This may be aided by Sodium Hyaluronate as a “wound-healing” ingredient.\n\nIt’s important to note that neither of these ingredient databases list gold as an ingredient with any skin benefits. Here’s some research on the benefits (or not) of gold for the skin from what I believe to be trustworthy sources:\n\n[https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html)\n\n**TL;DR – We can expect for this product to perform as it claims based on its ingredients. It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**Retail Price:**\n\nI did a quick search of “best 24k gold moisturizers” to compare retail prices for other notable products. It’s hard for me to definitively test the “retail price” claim unless there was a very similar product out there that I can find. So I’ll have to base this on comparisons as well as knowledge of the ingredients themselves. I don’t know the exact volume of the cream in mL so we are going to assume for now that 50g = 1.6 fl oz someone can get me the actual volume I will change this. So $100 for 1.6 oz is $62.5/oz\n\n[Orogold](https://www.orogoldcosmetics.com/shop/orogold-cosmetics/white-gold/24k-deep-moisturizer/) 24K deep moisturizer: $55/oz \n\n[Physicians Formula](https://www.physiciansformula.com/physicians-formula-24-karat-gold-collagen-moisturizer.html) 24k Gold Collagen Moisturizer: $12.5/oz \n\n[Chantecaille](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/chantecaille-nano-gold-energizing-cream-1-7-oz-prod50660039?childItemId=NMC0BE1_) Nano Gold Energizing Face cream: $247/oz \n\n[Farsali](https://www.sephora.com/product/rose-gold-elixir-P417139) Rose Gold Elixer (24k infused) - $54/oz \n\n[Peter Thomas Roth](https://www.sephora.com/product/24k-gold-mask-pure-luxury-lift-firm-mask-P392607) 24k Gold Mask - $17/oz \n\n[Nuface](https://www.ulta.com/gel-primer-24k-gold-complex-brighten?productId=xlsImpprod13521083) Gel Primer 24k Gold Complex - $19.5/oz \n\n[Ahava](https://www.ulta.com/24k-gold-mineral-mud-mask?productId=pimprod2004002) 24K Gold Mineral Mud Mask - $34/oz \n\nThe Faccia cream has a price/oz most similar to the Orogold and the Farsali products, and is much cheaper than the Chantecaille cream which is a luxury brand sold at Neiman Marcus. Comparing the Chantecaille incredients list to the Faccia cream, they are very different. The luxury cream has a huge list of various plant oils, extracts and perfumes. That doesn’t make it better, but it does have more ingredients. The Faccia base of water and Glycerin is similar to other water based moisturizers like Neutrogena Hydroboost, Simple, and even Tatcha Water Cream (although all 3 of those contain dimethicone and variants). Tatcha contains some more ingredients like plant extracts. It’s difficult to compare the ingredients lists of the Farsali and Orogold because the textures of the products are so different. However, the Farsali oil ONLY contains 24k gold, vitamin E, and plant oils as the ingredients, and is still cheaper than the Faccia moisturizer. Additionally, the Orogold lists Gold as one of the last few ingredients.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be anything in the ingredients list other than gold that would justify such a high retail price. Even other notable brands sold at Ulta and Sephora with gold in them do not reach that retail price, which suggests that the gold alone would not be enough to justify such a high retail price. In fact, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate and Methylparaben are all described as “cheap” ingredients on Incidecoder. One of the other star ingredients, niacinamide, is in a lot of products, and I can’t find anything that would indicate it is expensive. You can buy a niacinamide 10% suspension from The Ordinary for less than $6/oz.\n\n**TL;DR: The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\nMy conclusion: There is nothing wrong with this product at face value since It is safe for most people to use. If cruelty-free products are important to you, I would not use this product until the company’s cruelty free status is verified. As far as retail value goes, there isn’t any reason for you to repurchase at the retail price, unless you love this stuff and you can afford it. For other people, a basic silicone-free gel moisturizer with niacinamide should give you similar results for a lower price point. You can make your own decision about whether you should use it, but now you are educated on what it is, and you hopefully have a better idea of what you’re putting on your body.",

There’s a $15 flask of cinnamon liqueur with gold leaf in it, and it’s inexpensive to add gold leaf to food, etc.  Thanks for the research on the other aspects of cruelty free and parabens!   I have used expensive face creams like Elizabeth Arden Prevage line and see benefits for the cost for that particular brand.  However, I agree that a good moisturizer doesn’t have to cost very much.  Follow the process of cleansing, toning, serum, exfoliating, moisturizer...the massaging of the skin in itself will show benefits!  I can’t afford Prevage since a career change, and I am happier using trial size luxury products now.  The luxury is a gimmick too for the most part!

    "body": "My routine these days is mostly a mix of Paula's Choice and The Ordinary products. \n\n\nI also used to use Beautypedia as a trusted resource and guide when buying new make up and skincare products. \"Used to\" being the key phrase here. I was looking at buying The Ordinary's Buffet serum for my mother's birthday (she's having laser treatment on her face, otherwise I would get her the Advanced Retinoid 2%). I was googling some reviews at work and came across the Beautypedia entry. \n\n\nI'm pretty disgusted. Ever since Paula herself stepped down as CEO, Paula's Choice and Beautypedia really doesn't feel like good value for money or that trustworthy source for unbiased information any more. The Beautypedia entries use criteria that were never a requirement before, such as marketing strategies and texture being an indicator of an unstable formula. We all know Paula's criteria was quite simple - hygienic and stable packaging, scientifically proven effective ingredients, fragrance free, good mix of ingredients and no irritating ingredients like alcohol or essential oils. \n\n\nThe price hike in Paula's Choice products is impossible to ignore, and The Ordinary make PC look like money-hungry shills in comparison.  PC used to be considered quite affordable, but now some products are just as expensive as high end department store brands. Now it seems PC is using Beautypedia to shit all over The Ordinary. Heaven forbid someone else produces well packaged products with a high concentration of active ingredients at a cheaper price than they do. The reviews dance around the fact that the active ingredients are at the right PH, well packaged, and at a good concentration. They then speculate about texture being an issue, whether or not the finish is elegant or if grainy-ness (Vitamin C 23% Suspension) is a possible indication of an unstable formula. Really?!?!\n\n\nSkincare buffs shopping The Ordinary know what they are getting - the right concentrations of the active ingredients they want with little else in the formula. That's the main difference between PC and The Ordinary. PC's formulas contain a fair few other ingredients (like antioxidants and anti-irritants) other than the active ingredient, whereas The Ordinary cut the cost by offering the active ingredient, one anti-irritant and maybe some sodium hyaluronate. \n\n\nBeautypedia also contains a brand profile. In it, they speculate The Ordinary is a loss leader for Deciem and they suck new customers in using a bait and switch technique. Buy The Ordinary, then consumers move on to their expensive brands like NIOD to 'upgrade' their routine. I can't actually recall Beautypedia including that kind of information for any other brand.\n\n\nObviously, The Ordinary is highly, highly disruptive to other skincare companies because they prove that you don't have to pay a fortune for a high concentration of active ingredients. Of course, you don't get a well rounded formula with a bunch of other supportive ingredients, but if the active ingredients is in stable packaging, fragrance free and a good price point that hardly matters.\n\n\nOkay, rant over. How do you all feel about this?",

I remember reading the lactic acid reviews on Beautypedia a couple months ago, and apparently the reason they knocked a couple points (or stars?) off is because Deciem doesn't really like chemical exfoliants but sells them anyway (I'm pretty sure they listed that as a con). They're so nitpicky with TO and I'm 100% sure it's because they see them as fierce competition and are currently shitting themselves. \n\nAlso, the bit about the bait and switch is so dumb. NIOD is not an upgrade from TO, they sell different things! One has masks and cleansers and the other is more serums and treatments. \n\nReading beautypedia recently put me off PC more than I already was since they hiked up their prices. I'm slowly switching over completely to TO and other drugstore brands for cleansers, sunscreen, lotions etc.",

I don't think they should knock down a star or question the formula even if a product is expensive. I find it sketchy that when it comes to Drunk Elephant, they don't mention anything about the high price tag. They gave The Ordinary's Niacinamide + Zinc serum 3 stars just because it has a tacky finish and does not contain more ingredients 🙄. Isn't the main purpose of that serum is to just contain Niacinamide and Zinc? Also, they commented that the Clarins Hydra Essentiel serum should contain sunscreen to protect the skin from environmental factors. Ummm, what??? The Clarins serum is supposed to be a hydrating serum and does not claim to provide sun protection.    \nAlso, I find it fishy that a former Beautypedia product reviewer (who gave 5 stars to every Drunk Elephant products) now works at Drunk Elephant.

PC's Vit C serum for example is ridiculously expensive. Skincare should be affordable not a luxury. \n\nI was a fan of PC back in the day. I listened to Paula herself on iheart radio talk about how she thinks hand lotion, eye lotion/serums are a marketing gimmick used by money hungry companies. Your skin around your hand and eyes is no different than the rest of the body. It needs the same stuff to keep it healthy\n and clean. I believe it is discontinued but few years back PC released a hand or eye lotion serum, contradicting everything her company had stood for. \n\nMoreover, PC now have a men's line. Some products are the exact same like her BHA for men and cleansers. But they are cheaper. Men and women's skin are the same so the fact that she created a whole separate line just for men and charged it for cheaper was pretty disgusting. \n\nDon't trust her reviews anymore.

A good example is the demonization of alcohols in products. She not only conflates studies about drinking alcohol and topical alcohol to scare consumers into thinking topically applied alcohol causes the release of free-radicals. She also, pretends cell cultures and living organisms react the same way to the topical application of alcohol which they do not. Whether it be  (pretty much harmless) minuscule concentrations of alcohol or some of the various other forms of alcohols which can be beneficial in certain skincare products...like fatty alcohols for instance, Paula will condemn any product containing any alcohol to the garbage bin only to include various alcohols in her own products yet label them slipping agents or something, so as to not openly contradict herself yet continue to discredit the competition. And of course her greedy, exorbitant, prices for products that come in fairly minimalist/simple packaging and use inexpensive ingredients for the most part. She might have a few good products in her line, but many are overrated and her overall approach has always rubbed me the wrong way.

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today.

For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST.

I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure.

As always,* ***YMMV.***\n\n*Many of these companies* ***claim*** *that their product is the* ***gentlest*** *for the most sensitive skin because of EWG (Environmental Working Group) rating of 1, but* ***EWG is NOT a reliable source, especially for sensitive skinned folks***\\*\\*, *as they can be very biased and promote skin-sensitizing things just because an ingredient sounds more \"natural\".\\** ***Natural*** *things usually contain much more possible* ***skin triggers*** *than lab-isolated,* ***single*** *ingredients.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Potentially Irritating Filters (From Lab Muffin Beauty Science Blog)***\n\n>**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you’re left with inorganic sunscreens only.  \n>  \n>If you’re elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren’t particularly irritating or allergenic.  \n>  \n>A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SUNSCREEN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.\\[A24\\] Premium Sun Protection Cream -

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "When I heard about this new product line the other day, I decided to look at all the products and their formulations via SkinCarisma to see whether anything looked worth trying. A few products seemed promising, while others seemed... not so much. I thought since I'd already done all the work, I'd share my findings here!\n\nIn order approximately from most to least promising:\n\nBlemish Control Spot Treatment, 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide\n\n- **fungal acne safe!**\n- 5.5% is a higher concentration that necessary but shouldn't be too irritating\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both near end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (at end of ingred. list)\n- some nice **moisturizing** ingredients, including a good amount of squalane\n\nVitamin C Moisturizer\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 8th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (14th ingred.)\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane, lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- small amounts of cassia and green tea\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- advertises inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is last ingredient\n\nDark Spot Solution Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: polysorbate 20 (8th ingred.)\n- **niacinimide** is 2nd ingredient! brightening and anti-aging properties\n- advertises its inclusion of plankton extract but is 24th ingredient (also not much evidence that plankton extract does anything for skin besides moisturizing)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract  (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (last ingred.), citric acid (15th ingred.)\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- possible **allergen**: benzoyl alcohol\n- contains a lot of **silicones**\n\nRetinol Vitamin A Refining Moisturizer\n\n- amount of retinol isn't specified, but is placed 25th on ingredient list (you only need small amounts, 0.01% or more, to be effective, but need 0.5% or more for dramatic effects)\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.), polysorbate 20 (24th), cetyl palmitate (26th) \n- **retinol** has anti-acne, brightening, and anti-aging properties\n- other **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.), ceramide 3 (27th ingred.)\n- tons of aloe juice, good amount of squalane\n- small amounts of green tea and cassia\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- specifically advertises its inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is 26th (second last) on ingred. list\n\nOil-Free SPF 50 Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\n- broad spectrum\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl stearate (2nd ingredient), isopropyl palmitate (7th), PEG-100 stearate (8th)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.)\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: isopropyl palmitate (7th ingred.)\n- pretty small tube, only 50 mL\n\nFerulic Acid + Vitamins C and E Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for its vit C so is not a dupe for SkinCeuticals, but should still be effective\n- amounts of main ingredients not specified, however, vit C is the 5th ingredient, ferulic is 10th, vit E is 18th (second to last)\n- **brightening** ingredients: SAP\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E, citric acid, ferulic acid\n- citric acid (8th ingredient) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingredient)\n\nBio-Complex Moisturizer for Dry Skin\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- claim to have a \"high level\" of hyaluronic acid, and contains 2 kinds, but they're only 21st and 22nd on ingredient list\n- also super unclear on what their \"bio-moist complex\" is but if it comprises 20% of the product it must just be like, aloe and water and glycerin\n- but yeah, tons of aloe and glycerin, good amount of squalane, some other **moisturizing** ingredients, moderate amount of green tea extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (14th ingred.), vitamin E (23rd)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 5th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (13th ingred.), citric acid (10th)\n- contains **denatured alcohol** (3rd ingred.)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingred.)\n- HA is in the name and yet it's the last ingredient\n\nCharcoal Balancing Mask\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: PEG-100 stearate (9th ingred.), stearic acid (10th), glyceryl stearate (12th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- not sure how much charcoal is needed to be effective, but there may be a deceptively small amount in this, as it's the 16th ingredient and the product contains as much or more iron oxide as a colouring agent. also it lists \"charcoal powder\" and NOT \"activated charcoal powder\" so it may just be all-around useless.\n- advertises its use of hyaluronic acid yet it's the last ingredient \n- main mask component is **kaolin** clay (3rd ingred.)\n- 2 kinds of vitamin E (17th and 24th ingredients)\n- lots of aloe and some glycerin but not many other soothing or moisturizing ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: stearic acid (10th ingred.)\n\nHydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: contains polysorbate 80\n- claims to have 5 types of HA but I only counted 3: sodium hyaluronate, hydrolized HA, sodium acetylated hyaluronate (and they're all 18th or later in the ingredient list)\n- contains a TON of **silicone**, which seems like a poor choice to me, as HA should generally be applied earlier on in your routine and all that silicone will interfere with absorption of subsequent layers\n- no other notable or helpful ingredients, just a few **moisturizing** things like glycerin\n- more of a gel texture than a serum\n\nTriple-Peptide Eye Cream\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: stearic acid (3rd ingred.), glycol distearate (4th), shea butter (5th), ethylhexyl palmitate (8th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- peptides are last ingredient\n- contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) but is 18th ingredient and what little benefit that amount gives will deteriorate due to air exposure from jar packaging\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane and caffeine\n- small amounts of green tea and green algae extract\n- 5 potential **comedogens** but this likely won't matter for the eye region\n- if you look up this product on Amazon to examine yourself, note that the copyable list of ingredients in the Important Information section is actually the ingredient list for the Retinol Moisturizer, so use the ingredients listed in the product images\n\nHydrating Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.), pomegranate seed oil (14th), coconut oil (15th), olive fruit oil (16th), argan oil (17th), jojoba oil (18th), babassu seed oil (20th), moringa seed oil (21st), crambe seed oil (23rd)\n- 2 potential **comedogens**: coconut oil (15th ingred.), avocado oil (19th)\n- in addition to above listed plant oils, also contains chia seed oil, the only non-problematic one lol\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- **surfectants** used: decyl glucoside and glyceryl oleate\n\nOil-Free Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.)\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- micellar agents (**surfectants**) are decyl glucoside and glycerl oleate\n\nBlemish Control Oil-Free Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- advertises 2% **salicylic acid**, but unsure of the pH\n- **denatured alcohol** is the first ingredient!\n- contains grapefruit extract (3rd ingred.) - some sources say this is a great ingredient for skin, others say it's bad - I personally avoid it like I do all citrus-derived ingredients\n- contains **fragrance** (5th ingred.)\n- contains **sulfate**: sodium xylenesulfonate (13th ingred.)\n \nHope this is helpful! Let me know if I missed or got anything wrong!\n\nEdit: formatting\nEdit 2: butchered the spelling of \"comedogen\" all ten times I used it",

In the US, ingredients in concentrations of 1% or lower can be listed in whatever order the manufacturer wants to use. You can sometimes tell where that <1% begins if the product contains phenoxyethanol, because that's approved for use in concentrations of up to 1% -- meaning things *after* that are either at 1% or under.\n\n(Also, 1% HA isn't unusual, nor is it necessarily ineffective; it's normally used at/in concentrations of 0.2-2%. TO often uses 2% because of their unofficial \"more is **always** better\" philosophy [looking at you, 10% niacinamide serum], but <2% can be beneficial, too!)\n\nThat said, you'd think there'd be little reason for Amazon to list a \"banner\" ingredient at the very end when/if they have the option to list it earlier/higher.",

I’m Korean, love K-beauty, think it’s super fun to scope stuff out and try things. Sephora prices hurt my soul. I’ll have 1 thing in my Sephora cart = the same price of 5 things in my k-beauty cart.

It’s the “hot” ingredient in the US so brands will charge more even though the concentration is lower too.

For example, The Soon Jung Intensive barrier cream is just as good if not better than the Skinfix Triple Lipid cream and only $12/60ml tube and skin fix is $52/50ml jar.

    "body": "**TRETINOIN ADVICE**\n\nSome tips from my personal experience with Tretinoin Microsphere. \n\n1. Introduce Tretinoin during winter. (Tretinoin takes the top layer off, which protects us from the sun)\n1. Climatise your skin with retinol before you start on Tretinoin.\n1. Use a mild cleanser, wash your face gently. \n1. Avoid wash cloth, facial scrubs, astringents or any product that will irritate the skin eg actives like LAA, AHA, BHA.\n1. Do not apply immediately after washing your face. Wait 20minutes \n1. The face must be cleansed and completely dry in order for Tretinoin to work properly.  Having water on the surface of your face will prevent it from settling properly.\n1. You may mix Tretinoin with other skin serums if you are experiencing sensitivity.\n1. Start low (eg 0.025) to ensure your skin can adapt to its effects. Building your tolerance will create better results. Before you go to the next level, make sure you use up at least 1 whole tube and have no more redness/peeling before you get a stronger dosage.\n1. Try to use the Tretinoin every night even if you need to dilute it. Using it daily helps you to acclimate better and faster to it. If i stop for a week, it takes me a couple of weeks to get acclimatised to Tretinoin again.\n1. Apply a pea size of Tretinoin to your forehead , cheeks, nose & chin. You may want to avoid applying to sensitive areas like the corners of your mouth, eyes and nose. \n1. No need to use more than pea sized, Dr Frances Prenna Jones teaches how to use a \"chickpea\" size on this [video](https://youtu.be/RMHG3K5x_WE), fast forward to 16:23. She says \"MORE is not MORE\" lol\n1. Begin by applying every other night. After 2 weeks, if there is no redness or irritation, increase application to every night. If you develop redness or irritation, continue at every other night or decrease to twice weekly.\n1. After applying tretinoin, practise wait time of 20min-1 hour before applying your other serums/moisturisers for maximum benefits from Tretinoin.  \n1. When reintroducing Tretinoin into your routine after a long break or perhaps for the Tretinoin virgins, use your AHA/BHA in the day and Tretinoin at night. If you use both together, it may be too irritating for the skin.\n1. Gel is more potent than cream version. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pigmentation/comments/5acyqx/tretinoin_retinol_retina_differin_adapalene/d9o4wyy/)\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol  could give you a red, rosy hue to the skin as Retinoic acid increases capillary aborisation in the dermis. You may want to get a colour correcting primer to use before you apply your foundation. It could either be green/yellow based.\n1. Apply Tretinoin in the night only. No exceptions. Do not use in the day. Tretinoin is light sensitive.\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol will increase your photosensitivity, sunscreen is mandatory. Do not start Tretinoin if you do not intend to use sunscreen.\n1. Please use a mineral based sunscreen and wear a broad rim hat. Mineral based sunscreen will better block the sun harmful rays and are less likely to irritate the skin unlike sunscreen chemicals. Lack of sun protection can lead to easily burned skin.\n1. Less is more with Tretinoin.\n1. Continued use is key, as it takes some time to take effect.\n1. Ensure you hydrate hydrate hydrate.\n - Basically you just pile it on your moisturiser. I was using multiple serums and multiple creams and finished off with an occlusive every night... while your skin is adjusting to Tretinoin, the acid mantle may be broken and you'll suffer from TEWL big time...\n - In the day... get a mist.. and topup... good over makeup/sunscreen. Perhaps you can use a silcone primer as a kind of occlusive to prevent TEWL. Make sure you topup your sunscreen as Tretinoin makes you uber sun sensitive!\n1. Finish the routine with an occlusive if necessary.\n\n\n* DO NOT USE if pregnant or if you are planning for a baby (applies to females only).\n\n***\n\n[Transepidermal Water Loss \\(TEWL\\)](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32109-2_32) \n\n\n***\n\n**MOISTURE UP - best advice for tretinoin users**\n\nWith moisturisers.. make sure you use all 3 types. This youtube video can explain a lil http://youtu.be/QdNPiW4ZULk \n\n* Occlusives - you want only 1 layer, this is used LAST\n* Emollients -  creams, ointments, lotions and gels. \n* Humectants - as many layers as possible, water based.\n\nYMMV of course.\n\n***\n\nBasically i divide it into 3 categories since the above 3 categories can sometimes overlap\n\n* Water based\n* Non Water based including oils and butters\n* Occlusive\n\n**Tips**\n\n* You want lots and lots of water based moisturisers that are skin identical, water-binding, humectants.\n* Limit the oil based ingredients to 1 not too oily.\n* Unlimited from the water based category. \n* Use the Occlusive last and a thin layer will suffice.\n \n***\n\n#**Ingredients to look out for include:**\n\n**Water based**\n\nMy personal fave are Sodium Hyaluronate and Sodium PCA (similar to Hyaluronic Acid)\nWater binding agents / NMF Natural moisturising factors\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid (HA)\n* Centella asiatica (Gotu Kola)\n* Ceramides\n* DMAE Dimethylaminoethanol / DMAE Bitartrate\n* Genistein\n* Beta Glucan\n* Glycerin\n* Ceramides\n* Lecithin\n* Polysaccharides\n* Hyaluronic Acid\n* Sodim Hyaluronate\n* Sodium PCA\n* Collagen\n* Elastin\n* Proteins\n* Amino Acid\n* Cholesterol\n* Glucose\n* Sucrose\n* Fructose\n* Glycogen\n* Phospholipids\n* Glycosphingolipids\n* Glycosaminoglycan\n* Allantoin helps to improve the water content of the epidermis\n* Panthenol Vitamin B5\n\n***\n\n**Oil based:**\n\nAdd a facial oil but no more than 1 as you don't want to get too oily\n\n* i noticed a lot of people using rosehip oil. I don't think it is a good option as rosehip contains betacarotene and perhaps trace amounts of trans-retinoic acid. If you are using Tretinoin, you don't need any more vitamin A. * Perhaps choose a different facial oil that is more suitable for your skin type. \n * Plenty of Oleic acid for dry skin types and \n * Lots of Linoleic Acid for oily/acne prone skin as the skin is deficient in that Omega 6 fatty acid.\n* Check out [Gothamista's guide to facial oils](https://youtu.be/R1TZwTDlzw4)\n\n\n\n***\n\n**Occlusives**\n\nVaseline has the highest occlusive factor but i prefer the more natural versions instead of petroleum based alternatives.\n\n* Natural versions\n * Squalane / Squalene\n * Lecithin\n * Cocoa butter, Mango and Shea butter: Careful only Shea butter is non comedogenic\n * Coconut oil - comedogenic rating 4\n * Beeswax is a wonderful occlusive ingredient, especially for dry, chapped lip\n * Lanolin -It is a wax not fat secreted by sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Used for its protective and barrier properties.\n\n* Petroleum by products\n * Mineral Oil\n * Isoparaffin\n * Polybutene\n * Synthetic petrol chemical derived ingredients (they give a long term occlusion of the skin,  prevents the skin from recognising the need to repair itself)\n * Silicone\n * Methicone \n * Dimethicone\n * Cyclohexasiloxane\n * many other silicone derivatives (most ending with \"cone\")\n\n\n***\n\n**Skin Soothing ingredients**\n\nWhen you start peeling, this will help the skin reduce inflammation and heal.\n\n* Manuka Honey\n* Gotu Kola / Centella asiatica/ Madecassoside/ Madecassic acid\n* Allantoin\n* Calendula\n* Bisabolol / Camomile\n* Cucumber\n* Aloe Vera\n* Licorice Root\n* Oatmeal\n* Beta-Glucan\n* Zinc oxide (used in baby diaper rash creams too)\n* Snail \n\n***\n\n**Healing ingredients to include**\n\nUse this to accelerate healing from the \"Tret face\"\n\n* Copper peptides\n* EGF/ DNA repair\n\n*** \n\nRetinoids research\n\n* [Retinoids in the treatment of skin aging: an overview of clinical efficacy and safety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699641/) by Siddharth Mukherjee et al.

Because it degrades in the presence of sunlight, if you leave the house at all it will be rendered ineffective (your sunscreen can only protect you so much).  If you want to use tretinoin more aggressively you should probably try to get a larger dose. \n(Speaking as someone whose GP prescribed tretinoin twice daily, all it will do is cause your skin to peel off as if you got a sunburn. Makes it impossible for products to absorb and looks terrible.)",

The first couple of days, my face was red (looks like a mild sunburn), so I took 1 night off of both Retin A and BHA/AHA, then continued the next day. Since then, I haven't experienced anymore irritation except for a bit of flaking around the nose area. \n\nI also seem to do things completely different from everyone else. I put it on pretty much right after I wash my face because I WANT it to get absorbed and not just wash off somehow on the pillow as I sleep or whatever. I also put it right under my eyes/nose area too, because wrinkles in that area. I also don't put anything on my face before or after I apply my Retin A, since I saw somewhere that recommends tret be right next to the skin to be more effective. \n\nI think Retin-A is so effective that I could get away with using it less frequently and being persistent about using it. But on the other hand, I get it on eBay so it's so cheap that I wouldn't care about using it nightly.",

    "body": "Edit: Hi you guys!! i did not realize this post is the #1 result on google SEO when you search sulwhasoo reviews!! I have an updated post out now if you wanna check it, and my instagram is also @lonelyblep if you wanna ask questions there because Reddit i so bad at notifying me about your messages lul\n\nHello you guys I am back with another total brand guide, this time for Sulwhasoo. Many of you have requested one for Sulwhasoo ever since I did the one for Whoo. And I am happy to tell you that I know Sulwhasoo VERY WELL. As a skincare curator I always try to seek out new and innovative products for my clients to try, and Sulwhasoo is good old and reliable every time, yet they still embrace innovation. So the basics about every line, you have 5 phases of skincare: cleansing, awakening (First Care Activating Serum EX), balancing (water and emulsion for water-oil balance before any serum or special product is applied, treatment (these are where your serums and creams go, and finish (Luminature Essential Finisher, sunscreen or a sleeping mask) Their system is different, emulsion goes right after toner instead of after all serums / ampoules like other brands. The system is the same for all skincare from AmorePacific apparently. \r\n Anyways let's cut the crap and get to the guide, also l am going to do a mini review of each product\r\n\n\r\n-Essential: Introduction series to Sulwhasoo, meant for skin that is slightly aging but not too much, and for those who have water – oil balance issues. It is also meant to have a glowing effect and is good for dry, combination and normal skin.\r\n\r\n+First Care Activating Serum EX: Their bestseller. You can easily see why it is. 5 Korean herbs that make up Jaumdan, the main ingredient in this serum help to improve skin on all aspects and help to just upgrade your skin. To me it is a life changing product. Use before toners but after actives. (A special Plum Blossom version of FCAS was launched in April and has real plum blossom extract and fragrance) \r\n\n+First Care Activating Serum Mist: A mist with the active ingredients of FCAS and a layer of olive oil on top for emollience. I like this on top of makeup because it makes my skin look glowing. \n\r\n+First Care Activating Mask: When the people love something so much, it's logical that you'll have a spin off of it. This mask is soaked up to one third of a bottle of FCAS with all the good stuff and no alcohol so you use this after FCAS since FCAS has alcohol and it's an absorption boosting agent. Also if you want the goodness of FCAS in times of skin compromise (compromised skin stings from the alcohol in FCAS) this should be perfect. Gives my skin a radiant glow, softness, smoothness and clarity in one application, something your Dermal or Mediheal masks can't do in one use #whenwillyourfave\r\n\r\n+Essential Balancing Water EX: Their bestselling toner for it's cheap price and effectiveness. This toner is thicker than most toners you'll see in Western beauty. It has a light herbal scent, signature to the Essential line. It hydrates to no end, if Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion is a 10, this is a 20 \r\n\r\n+Essential Balancing Emulsion EX: Their bestselling emulsion. I feel like oily skin would love this. I don't really. Because I feel like it's only as goood as the toner at moisurizing. But oily people swear by this, lightweight moisture that does not fuck around, plus some nice antioxidants. I heard Liah Yoo raving about AmorePacific’s The Essential Crème Fluid but I actually think iff you pack on 2-3 layers of this stuff you can get the same moisture as you with the Crème Fluid, not to mention it's almost twice as cheaper.\r\n\r\n+Essential Revitalizing Serum EX: I always recommend this serum for people who are starting to see the signs of aging or do not see it yet but want to prevent it. It is a fresh, light gel texture that packs a heavy moisture punch. Oily people love it, but it would definitely be enough for dry people like me as well (of course with moisturizer on top, I am not a savage). Definitely an investment type of product if you're just stepping into the world of luxury Korean skincare. I do not believe in drugstore brands but some people just have to make do with what they have, but having this serum would definitely help their routine more efficient. \r\n\r\n+Essential Revitalizing Eye Cream EX: The smell of this product is definitely different from the other products from the Essential line. It smells faintly of white ginseng, and not the signature earthy-sweet Sulwhasoo base scent. It is more of an emulsion really and it's good for people who are starting with eye cream because this thing can't create milia due to it's extremely thin texture.\r\n\r\n+Essential Firming Cream EX: A lovely texture shifting cream that melts from a thick and smooth cream to a light emulsion, wrapping your skin in Hanbang goodness. Oily people might want to avoid this but combo skin should be fine.  It does firm up really. \r\n\r\n-Ginseng: Their signature line that started in 2000. Their Ginseng cream is so popular it practically became legendary. The line had a total revamp in 2017 (revamp was completed in 2018 with addition of the new Ginseng serum) including packaging and formulation improvements. Essential does not work on wrinkles while Ginseng works on almost every facet of aging care: Wrinkles, Elasticity, Tone, Texture, and Density. To remove any confusion and further enhance the line, Sulwhasoo launched Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water and Emulsion.\r\n\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water: An oil like toner that provides intensive conditioning moisyure to the skin, resulting in increased elasticity and overall health. The toner is highly moisturizng, smoothing and oily people can use this as an essence step.\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Emulsion: It smells strongly  of ginseng (a characteristic of the line) and the texture is similar to the Timetreasure emulsion (which we will get to later). It is intensely moisturizing and some say it might be a dupe to the lightweight version of the Ginseng cream. I confirm this.\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Serum: A serum with Ginsenisphere ( a patented encapsulation technology in capsules that lies within the base for maximum protection of the antioxidants and immediate release upon the skin). The updated version I heard removed Macro Ginsenisphere, the visible beads in the serum. This serum feels just like it's predecessor, a stretchy gel that does not feel oily or tacky but still leaves a smooth film on your skin. A lot of my clients reported better elasticity and smoothness. There are mixed reviews from people who have tried it's predecessor. \n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Facial Oil: A facial oil containing real ginseng seed oil blended in a mix of highly stable skin friendly oils such as Squalane, Sunflower, Jojoba, Korean Pine, Sesame and Apricot to lock in the effects of the serum and acts as a powerful moisturizing product on it's own with anti oxidative properties. This oil is used after serum before cream. The old version has meadowfoam seed oil which I LOVE but it's gone  but anyways the new one is the same so AmorePacific got lucky that I didn't try to burn their HQ. Oh and this is my HG facial oil. Ps: The oil blends sound like they have way tooo much oleic acid so as much as I am an advocate for oily skin using facial oils, oily skin should stay away.\r\n\r\n+100% Ginseng Facial Oil: An ultra rare limited edition product that consisted of pure Ginseng seed oil grown by AmorePacific themselves. I could never get it tho \r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Eye Cream EX: The renewed version has a stronger ginseng scent with a creamier consistency. This eye cream spreads like a dream and diffuses wrinkles in a month. \r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX: The star product of the brand. Smells strongly of ginseng, so you might wanna be careful with this baby. It is richly moisturizing yet being too thin in texture for my liking. It also contains mostly Ginseng extract which is a powerful antioxidant. My clients who do other beauty procedures like laser resurfacing or dermarolling swear by this. I personally think the texture is too thin but maybe that's just me, you can't even make a soft peak with this cream. I love how it actually makes my skin stronger and help calm it down whenever I use actives (which I stopped long ago)\r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX Light: A lighter version of the OG ginseng cream for those with combination to oily skin or those who dislike the scent of ginseng. Some dedicated people have went as far as using this as a day cream with the original Ginseng cream at night. This smells like fresh ginseng flowers and has a lighter, fresher texture. I would not say it's a gel cream, it does still have a tackiness to it, but it moisturizes efficiently for me and does not cause breakouts for oily people. You technically get less ginseng extract per jar for the same price but technically you still get the same one-night-after miracle. It still calms skin down and have anti oxidative properties.\r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask: A mask contains 8 times the power of the ginseng cream, the sheet mask is doused inside the miraculously repairing ginseng cream and double wrapped with another occlusive layer on top . The mask CAN transform your skin completely if you have dry lackluster skin, just give it 20 minutes and then you’ll be amazed. Oily skin stay a mile away from this stuff.\r\n\r\n-Hydro Aid: For younger and oiler skin, meant to be used in conjunction with the Essential line. I think they made this line since they noticed their sales plummeted during summer :v\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Water: A Korea exclusive product I think. I can't say much about this.\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Cream: A lightweight gel cream, it smells super nice and provides abundant hydration. But I suppose you can get something cheaper for just hydration purposes alone. But it does smell amazing though.\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid UV Protection Cream: A good physical sunscreen that provides a nice amount of moisture with minimal white cast. But overall kind of boring?\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Mist: It smells amazing and hydrates like a dream. HG mist. \r\n\r\n-Snowise: Brightening line with anti aging effects that help increase collagen synthesis and brighten skin through the use of sexy ingredients like licorice and white ginseng saponins. It has a unique take on brightening, called Volume Brightening. It increases the volume / plumpness of your skin so it can reflect light better, something not any brightening product can do. The range smells like ginseng + herbs + pine forest.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Cleansing Foam: Every beauty blogger's hanbang bae. It's actually a lot of people's first love from Sulwhasoo. I mean pH 5.5, luxurious creamy foam, and a scent that is to die for. Plus it's one of Sulwhasoo's cheapest products. Of course it's an instant hit!\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Exfoliating Gel (New version: Snowise Brightening Exfoliationg Mask) : I thought I heard it wrong. An exfoliating product? From Sulwhasoo? And a physical exfoliant? “A scrub. “ I thought. I cringed at that word ever since two disasters named Lancome and St. Ives happened on my face in my pre AB years. But oh well, it is Sulwhasoo after all. The gel is stretchy and contains BETA GLUCAN *FANBOY SCREEECH* and the scrub particles are made from ground WHITE GINSENG *DOUBLE SCREECH* and walnut shell (this is the same shit is in that Equate scrub but whatever it's much more gentle in this scrub) The smell is vastly different from the rest of the line, it's a straight up white ginseng smell. The particles are so small I can't even feel like it's doing anything on my skin, but actually my skin became TRANSLUCENT every time I use this. I swear that this is the only physical scrub I will ever put on my skin. [This review is for the old product,  I have yet to try the new one] \n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Water: A fresh and light toner with brightening extracts. This is WAY too light for me, I do not feel like it is giving me moisture that actually lasts. But other other hand it actually really helped with my pores. I consider this like the holy water for large pores.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Serum: The bestseller of the line and the entire brand. This serum skips all that proven actives and just goes for the extracts, in true Sulwhasoo spirit. I was a bit skeptical at first but I FINALLY SAW THE LIGHT. It gave me a bright complexion that is so plump, moisturized and transparent no other brightening serum can give me. \r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Mask: I use this mask twice weekly on top of the serum to seal it in and fuse with my skin. My skin is noticeably brighter after just one box. And mind you, the effect is NOT temporary. I can tell because my friends ask me what BB Cream / Cushion I'm using but I said it's just my bare skin. THEY WERE SHOOOK. \n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Spot Treatment: This concentrated gel to water correcting spot treatment penetrates deeply and suppresses melanin. Although the claims weren't supported by any study whatsoever, I can see that my dark spots around my cheeks have disappeared, and my bigger spot faded slightly so I can see there's a definite change. I admit that I love bright, fair skin (not related to Asian standards at all, just preference) but I hate the spots and imperfections that go with it tbh I’d rather have darker skin with less imperfections than spending MY YOUTH to treat these little shits.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Emulsion: A hydrating emulsion infused with brightening extracts that make for a lovely day moisturizer if you have oily skin. It smells amazing and for some, it really helps with water – oil imbalance. What I have noticed about emulsions is that they give your skin an instant surge of moisture and sink into your skin instantly but your skin's moisture levels plummet down to zero in about an hour. And you need a thicker cream to lock it in and hold that down for a timed release through out the day. And for dry skinned people, a cream alone is not enough since the emulsion 6orms a slippery layer on the skin, making the cream apply better and you can use less while still having a nice layer of it on your face. You might think that's counter intuitive but emulsion are far cheaper and you get much more for the price you pay. And the cream itself is thicker and with higher oil content while the emulsion is higher in water so you'll get a nicer balance of both elements.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Eye Serum: A lightweight eye serum meant to correct dark circles and puffiness with the included Zamak applicator. My clients love this because it really helps with their dark circles and it's the perfect choice for those who gave up on eye creams altogether because it the milia it causes.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Cream: A beautifully textured cream that is thick yet melts down into a milky texture and sinking into your skin, anchoring down everything you've put on your skin before. It gives your skin instant hydration but also provides some lipids as well.  I might say it's not enough for a night cream but for a day cream it is amazing. I can definitely see some plumpness even when used alone (with products from other brands, come on I can't use this product ONLY and expect a miracle, skincare is supposed to be a system)\r\n+Snowise Brightening UV Protector: A color correcting hybrid sunscreen with two shades (#1 Soft Glow for darker skin tones, #2 Soft Peach for skin that is pale but not bright or radiant) This sunscreen's texture is soft and creamy, smells like a dream and applies like a dream. They have turned the weakness of any physical filter into a strength. This sunscreen gives a subtle tone up effect that does not alsst long but should last long enough until you reapply again (2 hours)\r\n\r\n-Bloomstay: Launched in April to replace Innerise,  the line consists of a water,  serum and cream to provide a healthy dose of essential nutrients and antioxidants for skin to transition from late 20s to early 30s. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Water: *Cardi B voice* OKURRRR ZAMN they got the scent right!!!!  Ugh to die for!  This water is made from 5 types of germinated fruits and seed extracts, hardy orange, plum blossom extracts and the Jaumdan complex. It hydrates my skin very well. Reminds me of the Huxley Essence: Grab Water but much more fragrant. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Serum: Super smooth and soft, it has the same extracts as the water albeit more condensed + Niacinamide for brightening and soothing benefits. My skin feels amazingly calm and translucent after using this. Ugh.  Ugggghhhhh. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Cream: A thick smooth cream that makes people with dry skin HOWL. I am gagged by how much I love it. Spreads like butter and moisturizes deeply through the night. I can't comment on it's effects on fine lines because I don't have any.  (I use Sulwhasoo for as long as I can remember so duh) \r\n\r\n-Everefine: Previously the Goa line (until Sulwhasoo decided black was too goth for their brand). Meant for women in menopause experience hormonal shifts. The Goa line used to consist of an ampoule, an eye cream, a facial cream and a neck cream. The new Everefine line only has 2 products which are the ampoule and the cream. The neck cream has moved to the basic line, a line of optional add on products which can be used along with every line. You are expected to use the eye cream of the Ginseng line to accompany Everefine products from now on. \r\n.+Everefine Lifting Ampoule Serum: Quite a confusing name there. Basically the power of a serum on steroids (ampoules) with the absorption speed of a regular gel serum. It does not sound too much of a gel to me with Murumuru butter being the 4th ingredient. That and a lot of silicones and jojoba esters (yes in love with that shit), so I feel like this will be a very thick and richly moisturizing serum. It also contains coumestrol (a proven an Maseondan complex which is made of replenishing ingredients such as Gingko Biloba, Soy leaf extract, Shiitake mushroom extract, Adenosine (Proven anti aging ingredient) and of course, their signature Jaumdan mixture decocted in Honey. There is Jaumdan at the heart of every Sulwhasoo product. Maybe that’s why these products and the FCAS work together so well since they work in synergy. \r\n\r\n+Everefine Lifting Cream: This is a cream that is EVEN MORE emollient than the serum (ok I am a whore for emollient things so hmu please), it has the same Maseondan and Jaumdan complexes but now with cocoa extract + two super nourishing oils, Squalane and Meadowfoam seed oil. I'm seriously gonna try this because why the heck not.\r\n\r\n-Men: Range for men. Smells like pine. Manly.\r\n\r\n+Refreshing Cleansing Foam: A thick cleansing foam that can be used two ways. One you lather it up into a poof and wash your face. Two rub directly on a wet face as a scrub. Nothing impressive about the ingredients, it contains ginseng powder as the last ingredient and walnut shell powder as an exfoliant. I use this in the shower or on trips. It does remove makeup nicely when my oil cleanser isn’t around.\r\n\r\n+Inner Charging Serum: Ok you can't put a toner in a fancy bottle and call it a serum. That's cheating! Used this, smells nice and is basically Essential Balancing Water EX with a nice manly scent. It's not way too manly like cheap aftershave. It's very subtle and sophisticated. Speaking of aftershaves, this could be used as one.\r\n\r\n+Skin Reinforcing Emulsion: My favorite product of the range. Quick, no frills moisture on the go, a must have in my bag. Really good makeup primer. HG.\r\n\r\n+Age Defying Cream: Good for men who don't know what they want and want a bit of everything. This is for age prevention.\r\n\r\n+Relaxing UV Protector: A sunscreen FOR MEN and IN BLACK. Smells MANLY like MAN STUFF. Nice sunscreen, no frills, physical so u can apply and go and not wait 30 mins because MEN DON'T WAIT, WE ARE IMPATIENT.\r\n\r\n-Timetreasure: Their priciest complete anti aging line, might I even say, age reversal. Previously called Extra Refining, the line revolves around the power of the Red Pine, a type of pine so rare it is one of the most endangered species. AmorePacific cultivates it their own since harvesting wild red pine would be illegal. It would cost you $80 for just a bottle of red pine oil, but wait, don't Timetreasure products cost way more than that? You're right, but that’s because Timetreasure uses red pine extract, not oil, therefore it contains more of the actual essence of the tree bark. And you're paying for the fact that they know how to mix certain ingredients together so that it would work even better. Also did I mention red pine bark extract is the 1st ingredient in every Timetreasure product? (Not including the cleansing foam) I can not stress enough as a person with super dry skin even instagram  humid weather that this line is my HG (especially when used with Harmonizen) and with concerns for aging skin (people say I'm better off with Innerise but no hoe I know what I'm doing). Also to clear any misunderstanding, Timetreasure is more expensive than Ginseng (with both being anti aging lines) because Timetreasure also works on brightness more and prevents sagging, age spots, and smoothes out wrinkles in the long run (unlike some cheap collagen cream that seem to work instantly), something Ginseng couldn't do. I tested this on my self + my mom + my grandma and yes we all love it. \r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Extra Creamy Cleansing Foam: A newly launched product, and let me set the record straight, this is my mother of all HG cleansing foams. A thick cream that lathers up into clouds of extra creamy foam that cleanses even foundation effectively with no oil cleanser (just not eye makeup), it smells dreamy (different from the other products in the range, which are still dreamy btw) and my skin feels more MOISTURIZED than before using it, sometimes I leave the foam on my face as a mask. Since most cleansers only go as far as not stripping my skin, but this one actually ADDED MOISTURE to my skin while removing all of the nasties. One pea sized drop makes enough foam for 4, sleepover tested. This thing feels like I am washing my face with a moisturizer. If you want a taste of the Timetreasure line without paying the price, try this.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Water EX: This toner is probably the best toner from Sulwhasoo, it's a liquid toner with a slightly tacky finish that gives your skin an amazing glow and intense moisture and when used with the emulsion provides an amazing complexion not even a Siberian winter could ruin.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Emulsion EX: The unskippable product responsible for most of the moisture of this line. I use two pumps every day and night and the deep, warm scent of red pine just embraces my skin and lulls me to sleep, something I do not appreciate in the morning lol. This emulsion is super fast-spreading and is the same texture as the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX. When used with the water my skin is super soft, glowy and smooth and ready for the next treatment step. Tbh if I ever go home at 3AM and feel not even human, I just double cleanse, use the water and this. And I wake up to dewy skin, albeit at 11AM.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Serum EX: Containing the highest amount of red pine extract in the entire Timetreasure range, this serum is thick and creamy and smells lovely, one pump is enough for your face and neck. I am too young to see any wrinkle improvement but I can say that it gives my skin that extra 5 hours of sleep and I don't wake up with pillow marks on my face any more. It's amazing and it's such a rescue for dry skin. My mom actually saw some brightening and wrinkle reduction, her smile lines have softened, her forehead lines are gone (mine can never be because I tend to move my forehead a lot, she doesn't), and she has glowy skin even though she sleeps 4 hours a day. After a month, I'd say she looks at least 5 years younger. As for my grandma, her skin improved as well. She has super dry skin and the Timetreasure range is exactly what she needed. Her skin became firmer, her sagging was minimized and the skin looked brighter.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Eye Serum: This was launched along with the Timetreasure cleansing foam, a new eye product for better anti aging effect around the eye contour, the serum is meant for dark circles and loss of elasticity, it also provides some lifting as well and gives a “wide awake” effect, while the eye cream is meant for moisture, wrinkle correction and to increase the effectiveness of the eye serum. This comes with a golden eye care massager and with an instruction video to use both the eye serum and cream. The serum is thinner in texture compared to the Timetreasure facial serum. It sinks in quickly and when used with the accompanying massager and following all the steps, my eyes do look lifted and awake. My mom refused to use this as she thinks it's too much work though, my grandma enjoyed it though.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Eye Cream: I have noticed that this eye cream might come off as thick, but it's actually some sort of patented manufacturing process that makes this cream fluffy, not thick. Thick is like O Hui The First's eye cream, this one is actually just really fluffy, that’s why it melts down into an oil around your eyes which feels reallllly good. This when used alone provides firmness to my eyes. But when used with the serum, it's a life changing experience. My eyes have never looked this good. I could hold a baby next to my face and actually see no difference between our eyes. I truly love this product and the eye serums. My HG.\r\n\r\n+Sulwhasoo Timetreasure Renovating Cream: This cream has the most intense red pine scent of all the Timetreasure products. This is a thick rich cream that has a slightly brownish-red tint and actually DOES NOT go on smooth. It is tacky as hell. Do not even dream of using this without an emulsion. But when you use it, oh boy, it just locks everything in and gives such long lasting moisture without clogging pores (But common sense is required, this range is not for oily people!) It works even better with the serum, it made my skin so plump and radiant. And everytime my S.O kisses my cheek he always say that I smell like herbs, which is a good thing (I hope lol). The entire range as whole has changed my skin, I can't say the same for any skincare range (the two exceptions are Whoo's Hwanyu and Guerlain's Orchidee Guerlain, they are exceptional in their own way, and probably the skin I have today is the result of rotating between really expensive skincare and not sticking to just one brand.)\r\n\r\n-Harmonizen: If you think Timetreasure is pretty intense, this is not the end of it. Harmonizen is the mother of all Sulwhasoo intense-ness. And when I say my skin has an obnoxiously expensive taste for skincare, boy do I mean it. This line has one product and one product only, the holy Harmonizen Regenerating Cream EX. The cream is loaded with beneficial ingredients that I challenge you to read without gasping for air, and is meant to be used with the Timetreasure line in place of the Timetreasure Renovating Cream EX for ultimate anti aging. Some use it as a night cream due to the price (650,000 won, broooo, bro. Bro.) and texture. Also if it makes you feel any better paying an extortionate price for a 60ml jar of facial cream, some also use it in place of eye cream and serum \r\n\r\n+Harmonizen Regenerating Cream EX: Sulwhasoo's most expensive item out of all of their offerings. Formulated with Dermosul™ technology, and loaded with powerful extracts such as salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) which is actually clinically proven to have an anti wrinkle effect, ginseng extract, red and white ginseng saponin, murumuru and shea butter, angelica actiloba, mugwort, cnidium officinale, two types of licorice extract (glycyrrhiza uralensis and glycyrrhiza glabra for brightening), broussonetia kazinoki and oldenlandia diffusa for extra brightening (please see http://www.google.com/patents/US8647683 for a patent of a whitening ingredient composed of these ingredients), powerful humectants such as Sodium PCA, natural moisturizing factors (NMFs): ( Squalane , Beta Glucan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Cholesterol),  green tea leaf extract, meadowfoam oil, quinoa seed extract, vitamin E (tocopherol, tocopheryl linoleate), red pine extract (hello there Timetreasure), allantoin (for soothing benefits), fatty acids (arachidic acid, behenic acid), amino acids  (serine, alanine, glutamic acid), vitamin CG (ascorbyl glucoside), arginine, and finally the legendary Jaumdan decocted in honey. Wow. That was a mouthful. Anyways, the cream smells like herbs and stuff, very Sulwhasoo-y, but it is very faint and will disappear the moment you put it on your skin. But according to the website, the scent is composed of “Mugwort, pine, clove, Frankincense, white sandal wood, Agastache rugosa” or whatever the hell that is. It is SUPER SUPER SUPER thick, about the thickest cream I have ever witnessed in my life and goes on super smooth, it melts into your skin and then you'll have this sort of waxy finish for the first 5 minutes then it shifts into a smooth, silky finish. You are meant to use the accompanying obsidian spatula as an applicator / massage tool.  After two jars, I can conclude that this is indeed my HG cream out of all creams. My mom and grandma loved it as well. My skin was glowing and radiant, I think it actually made my skin one tone whiter, not brighter and my biggest dark spots shrank into tiny ones that you can't see without closing up on my face like a maniac, and it kind of makes my skin feel like when I was using the Whoo Hwanyu Ampoule (which is way more expensive than this tho) so maybe I can save some moolah after all :> My mom said her skin was so much brighter and her wrinkles have faded (not all of course). And she loves the fact that she can skip serum and eye cream with this product because she is a lazy bean :v My grandma said she thinks that it makes her face more vibrant and more rosy, which none of the products she tried done for her. I think this is definitely worth the money )) if it’s good, it’s worth it, it's not expensive, just high priced :v If you pay a shit ton for something with poor ingredients and does not work, then you can call it expensive.\r\n\r\n-Essentrue: Signature body care line from Sulwhasoo. It has a anti aging and moisturizing effect with honey and schizophyllum commune, pine nut oil, lotus fruit oil, prunus mume oil, apricot kernel oil and camellia oil\r\n\r\n+Essentrue Silky Body Serum: This lives true to it's name, it goes on so fresh and silky smooth and leves my body glowing as if I used a body oil, but this is not half as heavy. \r\n\r\n+Essentrue Deep Nourishing Body Cream EX: A lovely product to layer on top of the body serum in colder months. This feels so nice and luxurious and I can feel it wrapping my body in pure goodness. My mom said it also helps with her flabby arms.\r\n\r\n+Essentrue Hand Cream: It exists but almost nobody knows about it. And I can't get my hands on it no matter where I inquire. Must be discontinued.\r\n\r\n-Basic and Special: A line of miscellaneous products to accompany your regimen\r\n\r\n+Gentle Cleansing Oil EX: God damn do I love this oil, it deletes 9 layers of makeup in one go and moisturizes to no end. I recommend this to people who have blackheads as well and they find that it makes extractions easier and it helps minimize pores. I sometimes do musical plays so I tend to wear a lot of makeup, face painting and what not. And this removes everything :o I love it! And it smells amazing!\r\n\r\n+Gentle Cleansing Foam EX: A gentle cleansing foam that does not strip skin while effectively cleansing. I use this in the shower, mostly to get rid of the excess conditioner lying around on my skin. It smells good. pH 6.5-7\r\n\n+Gentle Cleansing Water: Gentle,  smells good. I wouldn't pay this much though?\n\r\n+Herbal Soap: My HG during breakouts. This smells strongly of ginseng (me likey) and foams like a dream. My breakouts cleared overnight. Bigger breakouts? 3 days. Remember to moisturize though as this is really drying, like really, but is it worth it? Hell yes. \r\n\r\n+Benecircle Massage Cream EX: This upgraded twice a week massage cream has a cream to oil formula plus the scent of plum blossom instead of the old signature Sulwhasoo base scent. I like the older one tho as it gives more control, while this is too slippery and makes massaging a bit harder. I also prefer the old scent. But I have to admit it moisturizes better than the old massage cream. Both give me a rosy glow due to increased circulation. I actually use this everyday. The oil emulsifies beautifully so if the pump bottle of the oil is too hard for travelling for you then try this since it's in a convenient tube and it removes makeup nicely, not as well as the oil but it wasn't designed for that anyway. If you have dry skin then use after FCAS and wipe excess off with tissue. If you have any other skin type other than dry, rinse after using and then apply FCAS.\r\n\r\n+Clarifying Mask EX: A twice a week peel off mask used after the emulsion step to help it absorb better and brightening + exfoliating. This smells so good and texture is honey like yess. My skin is so smooth and soft after using this. The only peel off mask I like. But the only con is that it takes 9 lives to dry a.k.a 30 minutes. \r\n\r\n+Overnight Vitalizing Mask EX: A thick, rich creamy sleeping mask that compliments your Sulwhasoo moisturizer perfectly without suffocating skin, it can be used as a night cream for oiler skin types. I love the smell and it feels like my skin is reborn every time I use it. \r\n\r\n+Radiance Energy Mask: Containing real white jade, this sleeping mask purifies skin for a brighter tone. AND BOY, SHE THICK. SHE THICK. Wow. Like this is so nice for dry skin and I feel like I am so blessed with this baby :o\r\n\r\n+Herblinic Intensive Infusion Ampoules: This baby is so good at calming down breakouts. A surefire anti acne combo is Herblinic + Herbal Soap + FCAS.. Use this after water and before emulsion. An anti aging ampoule that helps with acne? WOW. I AM SHOCKED. The miraculous anti acne effect isn't even advertised so I guess it's a beneficial side effect lol. My skin is way softer and smoother btw.\r\n\r\n+Microdeep Intensive Filling Cream and Patch: My mom uses this and I could visibly see her smile lines soften and it lasts! Just do your regular skincare after you do this treatment and the lines shouldn't come back. Sure it's not Botox but I mean it's something lol\r\n\r\n+Luminature Essential Finisher EX: This is created with Locsamhyo, a complex of ginseng and green tea for superior anti oxidative properties and is meant to be a long term preventive measure to prevent free radicals in an urban environment. This goes on as the last step of skincare (before sunscreen in the AM and before sleeping mask in the PM) to lock in the effects of your skincare and give your skin an antioxidant boost. I feel like my skin is fresher and brighter vs. just using skincare alone, and it helps my cushion / BB cream stay brighter for longer. Over years of using this product, I’d say that the benefit it give me (smaller pores, smoother skin, rosy glow) are far beyond what I paid for.\r\n\r\n+Firming Neck Cream: Originally from the Goa line, this neck cream promises to firm up neck skin and increase elasticity. My mom is using this but she is not getting much results  what a bummer. It smells nice though.\r\n\r\n+Renodigm Dual Care Cream EX: Pronounced “ren-no- dime”, it's a sunscreen / day cream if you're lazy. It not only contains SPF but also TPF to protect your skin from UV rays and heat, the causes for hyperpigmentation. It smells lovely and it's my HG sunscreen because it is so nice and so rich in moisture. It is a ridiculous price to pay for sunscreen though. Fun fact I used to call this “ren-no-dig-um”. Also did yall know AmorePacific own the patent to the TPF measurement? Shook.\r\n\r\n+Trufresh Soothing Mask: Meant to be used with Renodigm Dual Care Cream EX at night as part of thei heat protection solutions. You can use this as a rinse off mask (before FCAS) or a sleeping mask / night cream if u got oily skin. I smell Laneige Water Sleeping Mask vibes.\r\n\r\n+Essential Balm: Multi purpose moisturizing balm for eyes, lips and cuticles. Smells nice and keeps my lips soft. Some people put it on insect bites and split ends apparently. \r\n\r\n+Camellia hair oil: Smells lovely and tames frizz. Would not pay this much for a hair product if it ain't Goldwell though.\r\n\r\n-Hollistic Care: A series of products that embodies the Sulwhasoo spirit of tranquility. \r\n\r\n+First Peace: This home fragrance collection is inspired from the First Peace Essential Oil used in Sulwhasoo SPA. It has a candle, a potpourri, a fragrance sachet in the lineup and can only be bought in the Flagship store of Sulwhasoo. Therefore I will not mention this in the Flagship store section again. The candle can be bought outside the Flagship Store with another design though. \r\n\r\n+Plum Blossom: Just like the First Peace collection, but it also features a perfume oil for use on the body. None of the products from this collection can be bought outside of the Flagship Store. There is also a hand cream duo set that has the Plum Blossom and First Peace hand cream attached so you can't buy them separately. They make my hand so soft but I like First Peace more tbh.\r\n\r\n+Invigorating Ginseng  Extract Ampoule: A 4-week supply of supplement ampoules with ginseng extract. I haven't tried this as I feel like they might benefit old people more. I'm going to get my dad a box of this for Lunar New Year.\r\n\r\n+Lantern Collection: A golden-glazed version of their bestsellers: Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX, Essential Balancing Water EX, Essential Balancing Emulsion EX, First Care Activating Serum, Perfecting Cushion Intense. Perfect for any die hard Sulwhasoo fan and collectors as well. Having this full lantern collection is just about as much of a feat as owning every Shineclassic compact from every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lunar Zodiac Sign Collection: First Care Activating Serum EX in 12 designs featuring the lunar zodiac sign of your choice. All 12 zodiac signs can be bought at the Flagship Store at any time of day and any year , however the representative zodiac sign for the current year will be sold everywhere worldwide, not limited to the flagship store. (For example Sulwhasoo's FCAS has a dog on it this year and sold worldwide, but the other 11 zodiac signs are only sold in the Flagship Store)\r\n\r\n+Herbal Tea: Teaming up with Osulloc (Korea's #1 premium tea brand also from AmorePacific), Sulwhasoo releases 4 kinds of herbal teas to complete the holistic beauty experience. The range has Red Ginseng Blended Tea, Samdayeon Jeju Tangerine Tea (my fave), Sejak Green Tea, Plum Blossom Herb Tea. These tea actually taste really good and I asked my friend to get me like 5 boxes of Samdayeon Jeju Tangerine Tea lol I am addicted. Good for sipping when drama and conflicts happen. Sip sip bitch.\r\n\r\n+Herbal Soap: They also launched a new Herbal Soap collection with 4 facial soaps: Pine (for stressed, acne prone skin), oldenlandia diffusa (for brightening), licorice (for abundant moisture), red ginseng (original formula for skin lacking vitality and polluted with toxic substances)\r\n\r\n+Balm Series: Contains the Essential Balm with redesigned packaging and two other balms. Deep Relax Balm (Haven't tried this yet, supposed to be the Essential Balm but with a more relaxing scent), and Lip Tint Balm (lovely color that adds a rosy touch while not being too obvious about it)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is it for my post, 40k char max",

And when I read some online reviews, I realized, the actual mask is super thin and lodged between two pieces! Lol, ok I am not good with hydrogel-ish masks.

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

        "body": "So I was looking into [Physiogel Calming Relief AI cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/physiogel-calming-relief-ai-cream) in more depth, and I'm so confused about the ingredient Palmitamide MEA aka PEA aka Palmitoylethanolamide. Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

HA It's just a keyword to use because everyone is under the impression that it is awesome but if you know anything about true skin care and how HA really works in the body, you know that it is not good for you. The only time HA is good is if you have a special event or a wedding where you only need to have your skin look plumped and it's best for only a few hours but it's definitely something you do not want to eat everyday!!!

    "body": "**DISCLAIMER**: I'm no dermatologist. I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis.

And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula.

But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

I recently wrote this... enormous monstrosity on rosacea and shared it over at /r/skincareaddiction, but also wanted to share it here since I have found lots of value in the discussions here as well as the science surrounding AB ingredients (such as snail mucin, propolis, etc.). \n\nIn the future, I plan to do a large post that combines both AB product recommendations and SCA recommendations (as well as mine) for rosacea, but I felt this would be it's own post that I would later connect to this one.\n\nThanks so much for being awesome. I love this sub to bits and frequently come here when I am feeling down or anxious. I hope this helps some of you. <3",

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\n🌟 **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\n🌟 **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\n🌟 **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\n🌟 **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\n🌟  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\n🌟 **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed! i'll also leave my current routine in the comments below, for those who may be interested. i hope this was of some help to y'all :-), and that all of you would have good health during this period!",

However, I didn't get along with tamanu oil in the past (this serum contains 10%) so I'd hesitate to purchase this without trying it out first. \n\nOn a superficial level I love the pump bottle + the aesthetics and the fact that it's 40ml. And Krave Beauty will also donate 2% of every sale of the GBR serum to a foundation that protects the Great Barrier Reef here in Australia! Overall I'm really interested to read the reviews for this product :)\n\n*Edit: percentages and COSDNA link*\n\n*Edit 2: here’s the YouTube video introducing the product (https://youtu.be/q_HcZm9OjJ8). It has a few before and after pics towards the end*",

It also seems weird to me that there would be lactic acid in this, as it can be bad for some with sensitive skin (which you’d think this product would want to be totally safe for) and according to the Simple Skincare Science post on repairing your barrier ( https://simpleskincarescience.com/dehydrated-skin-moisture-barrier-acne-fix/ ) would want to avoid all chemical exfoliants for a month at least while you are letting it repair and before you start to add a chemical exfoliants back in. So it’s odd to me that this would have lactic acid in it, instead of just being a super repairing moisturizer that anyone can use no matter what other actives they already use. I am on a Curology script for Tret and I’d be wary of over exfoliating with this as it has the lactic acid in it, but if it didn’t I’d love to be able to use a super moisturizing and barrier strengthening product after my Tret! 🤔",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO.

It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

I purchased this product a few months ago in the hopes of clearing up my PIH and so far, I find quite efficacious. \n\n**Skin profile**: Type- Oily, sensitive and prone to acne\nTone- medium (I use Maybelline Fit Me 220)\n**Skin concerns**:hyperpigmentation, acne, clogged pores. \n**Climate and season**:Tropical, summer (very hot and humid) \n**Product**: Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion (light) \n**Ingredients**: Water, Glycerin, Methylpropaned Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Diglycerin, Glycera Betaine, Trehalose, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose E Alpha-Arbutin, Chlorphenesin, Polysorbate 20. Hydro Lecithin, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Metabisulfite, Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbic Acid, Resveratrol \n\n*Review*\n\n**Smell**: It is fragrance-free which is great for my sensitive skin. I can't detect any scent otherwise.\n**Texture**: Quite runny. It absorbs readily into the skin but leaves a very slight sticky feel.\n**Application**: I pour some into my palm, then spread it evenly on my skin, both on my face and body. \n**Length of use**: 3 months\n\nMy skin is recovering from acne, so I'm dealing with PIH and uneven texture. I thought this looks like it would help, seeing as it has niacinamide high up in the ingredient list, which has helped a lot with my hyperpigmentation before. I am quite pleased with the results. It definitely helped to fade my PIH. I had a huge pimple on my thigh which left behind a large purplish-brown spot. I applied the product every night on the spot and the discoloration has faded considerably. It's not completely gone but only 1-2 shades darker than my skin. The lotion also made my skin soft and overall brighter and smoother. \n\n Would definitely repurchase!",

It didn't even have an official sign on it, just the name and price handwritten in sharpie, so it must be super new. \n\n[Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer with aloe and green tea extract](http://imgur.com/a/q6TViPm) 75ml - $8.99\n\nIt's definitely one of their more expensive cosmetics but based on the ingredients it looks pretty good for the price. Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

    "body": "Hi! I have tried so many AB beauty products that I thought I could give my thoughts on some popular and lesser known products. If you want pictures of any of them – the packaging or how they look on my hand, please let me know! I have so many products to get through (at LEAST 20, maybe close to 30) that Ill be breaking up my reviews into parts. This will just be water cleansers, essences, and toners.\n\n\nAge: 28\n\nSkin concerns: acne prone, aging, dryness\n\nSkin Type: combination leaning dry. Oily on days where I exert a lot of energy and am dehydrated.\n\nRoutine: Argireline/proteins or Vitamin C in the AM, tretinoin in PM. My proteins are non-AB so you wont be seeing reviews for those here unfortunately.\n\nCurrent Environment: Humid (I live in a coastal area). Moderate temperature.\n\nMakeup: Not much at all. Eyeliner on days I have the energy and blush and lip products if I’m gonna be outdoors and don’t need a mask.\n\nYou’ll notice a lot of products have good reviews, but that’s because I look up reviews before I buy a product so I can make sure it’ll work for me and Im not wasting money. Read for the experience, not so much the number rating.\n\n\n->Cosrx Good Morning Cleanser: I don’t have much to say about it. It’s a simple cleanser with a pretty thin consistency, and doesn’t strip your skin much. Granted I used this years ago so Im going off memory, but I believe the Purito cleanser below was a little better at not stripping. Good for people just starting out in skincare. 3.5-4/5\n\n\n->Purito Defence Barrier pH cleanser: I got this one after finishing a bottle of Cosrx’s Good Morning cleanser. I enjoyed that one but I liked this one more as it was thinner but still felt like it cleaned up my skin well without stripping at all. I’ve been using one bottle for about 2 years. I have many left to go through and I feel like although I did really enjoy it, there are probably better ones out there. When I had my sunburn, someone pointed out there was tea tree oil in it so I used another cleanser during that time. Not enough to take off sunscreen that leaves a white cast/ film on your face but I think that’s true of all water cleansers. 7/10 Note: I used the Banila co cleansing balm to get rid of the sunscreen.\n\n\n->From Nature Aloe Vera Moist Cleansing Foam: Has a nice fresh cucumber scent that I personally enjoy but if you don’t like fragrance you may want to avoid this.¬ Aside from that it’s a regular cleanser that I used during a time where I was sunburnt and sensitive. Foams up a lot and does leave you just slightly stripped feeling but not as bad as some other cleansers. I don’t think there’s anything too special going on but there are other From Nature products that I enjoy a lot more. Its on the thicker side, think maybe the Face Shops Rice Bran cleanser. 3/5\n\n\n\n->Innisfree Firming Energy Essence with Fermented Soybean – at first, I thought I didn’t notice any difference with this essence. Especially after using some instantly hydrating MISSHA essences, I thought this was only mid. So after using about half the bottle in my routine, I decided to repurpose it and give its place in my routine to another product. I started using it as the lubricator in my Gua Sha massaging instead of a serum, and it worked BEAUTIFULLY. Maybe since  I was actively pressing it into the skin and layering it, it became so hydrating and plumping. My skin felt hydrated and dewy for a long time after, and soft to the touch. Id suggest layering it or using it in a massaging routine like I did for hydration. I’ll also mention that very recently I suffered some sunburn that sensitized my skin to a lot of products for a week. I was able to use this just fine, and honestly I think it may even have helped it clear up faster, if even just a little. 4.5/5\n\n\n\n->MISSHA Time Revolution Red Algae Essence. I don’t have much to say about this – hydrating and plumping. I really like it and once I finish all my essences off I may just repurchase it if nothing else surprises me. It’s simple and was also one of the products I used when I was dealing with my sunburn. Its not going to change your life but \nI believe its universally usable and does the job its meant to do. 4/5\n\n\n\n->Momo Puri Peach Concentrated lotion: Thin consistency, just slightly less viscous than water. AMAZING scent as I LOVE peach – it’s the whole reason I bought this! It has Vitamin C and retinyl palmitate in it, so I was unsure where it fit in my routine. I changed it’s placement around a couple times and found it worked best with my tretinoin routine. Somehow it just made me glow, hydrated, and the tret still did its thing. I re ally can’t emphasize how much I love the scent, and the fact that it still did an amazing job. A wonderful product and I would honestly repurchase once I’m done with all my other stuff, but it may not be suitable for people with sensitive skin. 8.5/10 \n\n\n\n->Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion (old formula): The consistency is kind of thick for a toner, but still pretty viscous.  At first I thought It wasn’t really worth repurchasing as I thought it was a little /too/ thick and I had many other hydrating products in my routine. However, once I finished the bottle and replaced it with other products in my routine, I did find that it was harder for my skin to get and stay hydrated! This may be more suitable for people with dryer skin, and Im not sure how it would go for sensitive skin. Although I felt like I didn’t enjoy the use of it, It clearly did more for me than I thought. Would repurchase, although I don’t know how the new version would stack up. If you want to keep your routine minimal but still get lots of hydration, I would say you should try this out. 4/5\n\n\n\n->HaruHaru Wonder Hyaluronic Acid Black Rice Toner: Another one where I don’t have much to say. It’s a hydrating toner and it works! The consistency is thin but not as thin as water. A very simple toner that does exactly what it \nsays it will. It may not blow you out of the water, but it is reliable. Unscented. 4/5\n\n\n\n->Numbuzin No. 3 Toner: I haven’t been using this very long so its more of a first (or 2 week-long) impression. So far, I really like it! I was really surprised the first time I used it how hydrating it was. I feel like it also makes me does successfully make me glow, which is what its claim is. The smell is diviiinnee for me – smells sweet, almost like pear juice but there’s no fragrance listed in the ingredients which means that’s just what the ingredients smell like! I do really enjoy using it – from the natural scent to the feeling of its thickness, to the glow and hydration it provides. The consistency is thick like syrup, and I feel like I need quite a bit of it to evenly spread it around my face and neck. It consists of ferments so if that’s not your thing, avoid it because the ingredient list is /very/ extensive and its almost all ferments.  Not suitable for sensitive skin – I introduced it into my routine when I didn’t know I had sensitive skin due to my sunburn, and I thought I was allergic to it, it stung so bad. I had to wash it off (and if you’re wondering – testing skincare on my arm or near my ear isn’t a good indicator for allergies as my face seems to respond differently). It also has sodium Hyaluronate so if you’re avoiding that, this may not be for you. I don’t know if I would repurchase it though, but I am glad I bought it and am very much enjoying using it. 4.5/5\n\n\n\n->HANYUL Artemisia Watery Calming Essence (Toner): a simple toner that honestly I didn’t feel like did a whole lot. Consistency was probably the least viscous of all my toners. The scent was one of my favourites – you know that fresh-cut lawn scent? That. Amazing.  Slightly hydrating and when I used it when I had my sunburn, I felt that it may have stung just a little bit when I applied it. I thought maybe it was the citrus extracts, but I did use it a couple more times during my burn era just to test it (its supposed to be a calming toner! Huh!) and it didn’t sting again but I was a little paranoid. It could very well have just been another product that caused the stinging but the citrus extracts just make me wonder. I feel like if you have sensitive skin, there are better products out there, but if you don’t and just want a nice artemisia toner, I do really like the use of this. I honestly do like using it and the bottle feels heavy and luxe. A friend of mine stayed over and when I gave them options for which of my products they wanted to use, they opted for this because the bottle/packaging looked so good. 3/5 for the product but 5/5 for the packaging.\n\n\nEDIT: forgot to post this the first time I uploaded\n\n-> Mamonde rose water toner. The consistency is thinner than  water. Its very heavily fragranced like rose, so I feel wierd using it in my regular routine. However, if I feel dry throughout the day, I can just splash some on and its instantly hydrating, and my skin STAYS hydrated. Because of the fragrance it might not be suitable for sensitive skin, but I actually really love this toner. The packaging says you can  pour it into a spray bottle and use it as a mist. Once Im done with my Secret key essence mist, I may just follow their tip because it really is just wonderful throughout the day to perk my skin up. 4.5/5\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf youd like a preview of some products Ill be reviewing later, heres a (not comprehensive) list:\n\n-Im From Rice serum\n\n-Dear Klairs Vitamin E mask\n\n-Ceracolla Perfect Gel\n\n-Primera Alpine Berry Water Cream\n\n-Tonymoly Chok Chok Green tea watery cream\n\n-Mizon Collagen power lifting eye cream\n\n-Isntree Hyaluronic Acid essence\n\n-Isntree Natural Sun Cream\n\n-Frudia Avocado Relief Sunscreen\n\n-The Saem Iceland Aqua Gel Cream\n\n-Ample:n ceramide shot\n\n-ONE THING Houttuynia Cordata Extract\n\n-MIZON placenta ampoule cream\n\n-AMOREPACIFIC treatment enznyme peel\n\n-Neogen Wine Peeling pads\n\n-TONYMOLY Floria 100 hours cream\n\n-Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella ampoule\n\n-Some By Mi super miracle spot all kill cream",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won’t meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That’s the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won’t be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there’s a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ❤️",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

        "body": "This is why I stick with Adapalene for my retinoid because I know it works because it had to be proven that works when it first hit the market as a prescription product. I buy cleanser and sometimes moisturizer from DT because I don’t really need actives per se from these products since I use Adapalene. I’m currently using the glow recipe watermelon moisturizer dupe which has niacinamide. I don’t know the quality of the niacinamide nor the percentage but for 1.25 I’m willing to try it since I’m not relying on it solely for an active ingredient. I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it’s a glass jar and it’s 2 oz. But it’s a very “wet” texture which I don’t like because then I can’t apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene? The packaging says not to use any other acne product so I just really haven’t really tried it but was curious if anyone knew.",

    "body": "**What motivated this review:**\n\nI grew up in an area with access to natural hot springs.  I used to go for soaks in the geothermal pools quite often and it was (and still is) one of my favorite things to do.  I now live quite far away from where I grew up and sadly there aren't any hot springs within driving distance. Feeling a bit homesick this past winter, I tried out a bunch of Japanese hot springs powders and thought you guys might be interested in some reviews.\n\n\n[Album of the products reviewed.](http://imgur.com/a/B4wC5)\n\n[Bonus cat pic](http://imgur.com/bA5dtMf)\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy White**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/5ZXT7Ri)\n\n- I purchased this on Amazon Prime (~$18 for 680g tin).\n\n**Claims:** (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n>  Contains Angelicae Radix Extract that increases blood circulation and relieves aches and fatigue\n>  Contains Dried Puerariae Radix Extract that increases skin vitality\n>  Helps to ease rheumatism, cold constitution and relieving fatigue\n> Transforms bathwater into milky white color with a calming citrus floral fragrance\n\n**Ingredients:**  \n- Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, Japanese angelica root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, fragrance.\n\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This was my favorite out of all of the bath powders I tried.  Lovely scent and very relaxing bathing experience! I've seen it described in marketing materials as \"fresh citrus floral bouquet\" but it doesn't smell how I'd imagine based on description alone. There are notes of citrus, but they are subtle. Stronger when you smell it in the tin, and seem to fade once the powder is dissolved in the bathwater.  The floral fragrance is similar to what I think of as hanbang: musky and herbal. Not sickly sweet. Neither feminine nor masculine.  There are notes of rose, but not like Mamonde rose, more like musky rose incense.  The scent is strong but IMO not overpowering. A little bit goes a long way.\n\n\n- RE the claims, adding this to the bathwater does seem to make the heat hold longer and it does soothe minor muscle aches and pains.  However, it definitely does not cure fatigue, as I'm usually so relaxed by the end of it that I'm ready to fall asleep in the bath.  I'm also skeptical of the claims about skin vitality.  It does make my skin feel silky, but beyond that the benefits to skin seem pretty negligible.\n\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy Blue**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/s8nXU5q) \n\n- Purchased on Amazon Prime (~$18 for 680g tin)\n\n**Claims:**  (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> [H]ot spring mineral (sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen sulfate) and herbal medicines (angelica extract) can work to the core of the body to enhance the warm bath effect, stiff shoulders medicated bath agent that is effective in low back pain, neuralgia. In warm coat of assimilated active ingredients, hot spring mineral turbidity hot water to enhance the warm bath effect prevents Yuzame. Protein and hot springs mineral of the surface of the skin to create a thin film on the entire body, in order to prevent the dissipation of heat, thermal effect will persist. In addition, herbal ingredients, angelica extract (active ingredient) is, to enhance the warm bath effect, warm the body from the core. To promote blood circulation, it is also effective in recovery from fatigue because loosen the body.\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- dried sodium sulfate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, Toukiekisu distributed, oxidation Ti, POE (300) POP (55), perfume, silicic acid anhydride, stearoylglutamic acid Na, anhydrous pyrophosphate Na, salicylic acid, bentonite, glycine, Jiouekisu, BG, blue No. 1\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This smells strongly of artificial fruit in the tin. At first whiff, it reminded me of Sweet Tarts candy.  A reviewer on Amazon compared it to Pez with a hint of flowers, which I think is pretty accurate.  It mellows out quite a bit once it's in the water.  The fragrance is not as strong as some of the other varieties.  The powder is a dark blue right out of the tin.  True to its description, it makes the bathwater a cloudy blue color.  \n\n- RE the claims, adding this to the bathwater does seem to make the heat hold longer.  I am skeptical about the claim that it forms a film that keeps your body temperature warm after leaving the bath.  I didn't notice any real difference compared to the warmth I feel after taking a regular old bath.  I am not sure what “Yuzame” means or why I'd want to prevent it, but the claim about relaxing muscles is definitely true, IMO.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy Green**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/Ro6TWEM)\n\n- Purchased on Amazon Prime (~$24 for 680g tin)\n\n**Claims:**  (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> About 90% of hot spring mineral and herbal component of all the components. Enhance the warm bath effect in warm coat of turbidity hot water, to prevent Yuzame. Effective, such as fatigue, shoulder rest, low back pain, neuralgia, poor circulation, arthritis, heat rash, eczema, roughening resistance.\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- The scent is herbal, floral and slightly fruity. There are notes of passionfruit and citrus. Right out of the tin, the product is dark green.  It turns the bathwater into a beautiful cloudy bright green color.  \n\n- RE the claims, I can't speak to the parts about “neuralgia, poor circulation, arthritis, heat rash, eczema” and not sure what “roughening resistance” even means, but this one is just as good at relaxing tired muscles as the blue and white varieties.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Japanese Cypress (Hinoki) **  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/rdj2I3t)\n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n \n**Claims:**   (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> [A] medicinal bath salt series with natural essences, relaxing. Ion veil wraps the whole body, retains its warm after bathing, bath effect. Stiff neck, back pain, poor circulation, fatigue effects.\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n- sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate, thehalose hinokitol, fragrance, D&C Yellow no. 8, polyoxyproplene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- Straight out of the tin, this stuff is orange in color and smells strongly of earthy pine with a hint of smoky campfire.  A more masculine scent overall.  Once it's in the bathwater, it mellows out but the pine notes stick around.  It turns the bathwater a cloudy orangy white color.  The effect of this one is similar to the Muddy varieties reviewed above.\n\n**Bath Roman Milk Protein**  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/q8yX8k8) \n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n\n**Claims:**  (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n> Milk protein penetrates into dry skin cells, replenishing your skin's moisture level.\n> Soaking with Japanese bath powder keeps severely dry skin moisturized and nourished.\n\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- sodium bicarbonate, sodium caseinate, fragrance, parabens, polyoxypropylene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This smells like sweetened condensed milk, but not in a bad way.  It’s a lovely sweet steamed milk and slightly floral, slightly baby powder scent, more feminine than some of the others.  It reminds me of Etude House Milk Talk body wash with a bit less baby powder and a bit more milk.  It didn’t seem that strong to me, but my husband came home while I was in the bath and he could smell it when he walked into the house (which is saying something because our bathtub is on another floor). True to the description, this does turn the water a milky white color.  It made my skin feel silky smooth, but I am skeptical about the claims about nourishing dry skin.  My skin certainly didn't feel dry afterward, but it wasn't incredibly moisturized, either.  My skin is naturally on the oily side, so someone with dry skin would probably not find it very moisturizing at all.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Ceramide**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/vHSKQ2t)\n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n\n**Claims:**  (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n> Contains Ceramides that replenish and retain moisture in the skin.\n> Helps eczema, acne, heat rash and other skin irritations.\n> Leaves skin smooth and moisturized after bathing.\n> Soaking with Japanese bath salts relaxes, moisturizes and polishes rough skin.\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- Sodium bicarbonate, sodium caseinate, fragrance, parabens, polyoxypropylene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This has a bright, fresh lilac and clean linen scent.  It turned the bathwater a milky white color.  It made my skin feel soft and moisturized, but was not emollient.\n\n- Consistent with my review of the Milk variety, I am skeptical about the claims about moisturizing dry skin.  My skin certainly didn't feel dry afterward, but it wasn't incredibly moisturized, either.  My skin is naturally on the oily side, so someone with dry skin would probably not find it very moisturizing at all. I am lucky to have pretty tolerant skin that's not prone to irritation, so I can't speak to the claims about healing eczema, acne, heat rash and other skin irritations.\n\n**Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe (Uruoi)**  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/bJlMZzN)\n\n- Purchased from Japanese grocery store (~$8 for 600g), but you can buy it on Amazon for ~$12 shipped (not Prime)\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon)\n\n> Increase blood circulation and warm your core. Emerge renewed.\n \n**Ingredients:** \n\n- Sodium sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium glutamate, fragrance, silica, PEG-75 stearate, cellulose gum, sodium polyacrylate, sekken soji, polyacrylic acid, bentonite, water, butylene glycol, methicone, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, pvp, aloe yohjyu matsu ekisu, sodium hyaluronate.\n\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This was my least favorite of all the bath powders I tried, largely because of the scent.  It’s like a combination of artificial cucumber, lime, Pine Sol and Degree men's deodorant.   That said, it was the most moisturizing and emollient of all the bath powders I tried.  RE the claim about increasing blood circulation and warm[ing] the core,” my hunch is that it's mostly the hot bath water that is responsible for this, rather than the powder itself.\n\n\n**Bathclin Pure Skin**  \n[Pic](http://imgur.com/An3xsiP)\n\n- Purchased from a Japanese grocery store (~$8 for 600g), but you can buy it on Amazon Prime for ~$13\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon - same as Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe)\n\n> Increase blood circulation and warm your core. Emerge renewed.   \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n- Sodium sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium glutamate, fragrance, PEG-75 stearate, cellulose gum, silica, sodium polyacrylate, sekken soji, polyacrylic acid, bentonite, methicone, hydrolyzed collagen, water, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, pvp, glycine soja (soybean) seed extract.\n\n\n**Review:** \n\n- After trying and disliking the scent of Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe, I admit that I was not super eager to try this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Like the Bath Roman muddy white, this is marketed as having a “citrus floral” scent.  However, this one actually does have a strong citrus fragrance.  It smells strongly of grapefruit, which to me is heavenly.  There's a hint of Lemon Pledge fragrance, but I don't find it bothersome.\n\n- It could be my imagination, but I swear there is a slight effervescent effect right after the powder goes into the bathwater.  It turned the bathwater a milky white color.  It made my skin feel silky smooth but was not nearly as moisturizing as Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe.  RE the claim about increasing blood circulation and warm[ing] the core,” my hunch is that it's mostly the hot bath water that is responsible for this, rather than the powder.\n\n**Tabino Yado Hot Springs: Milky and Clear varieties**\n\n[Pic of the Clear varieties] (http://imgur.com/QBo58U1) (unfortunately I accidentally got rid of the box for the Milky varieties :-/)\n\n- I purchased these on Amazon Prime (~$23 for 28 packets), but you can also buy boxes of Milky (13 packets, 25g each) and Clear (15 packets, 25g each) separately for around $12 each.\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon)\n\n- Each of the 9 different varieties is supposed to represent a famous Japanese [onsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen).\n\n- According to the product description:\n> [n]ot a perfume or bubble bath - Minerals promote circulation and warmth... Intense aromas relax you and last as long as your bath!\n\n**Ingredients for Milky varieties:**\n\n- [KIRISHIMA] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, fragrance, silica, aconus calamus root extract, aloe arborescens leaf extract, dipropylene glycol, alcohol, water, FD&C red no.28, FD&C yellow blue no.1 \n\n- [OKUHIDA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminim silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [SHIRAHONE] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium glutamate, calcium carbonate, kaolin, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, potassium chloride, silica, cellulose gum, fragrance, ci no.59040 pyranine conc, ci no.73015 indigo carmine, \n\n- [TOWADA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminim silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090).\n\n\n**Ingredients for Clear varieties:**\n\n- [BEPPU] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, fragrance, silica, aconus calamus root extract, aloe arborescens leaf extract, dipropylene glycol, alcohol, water, FD&C red no.28, FD&C yellow blue no.1 \n\n- [SHIRAHAMA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminum silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [HAKONE] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium glutamate, calcium carbonate, kaolin, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, potassium chloride, silica, cellulose gum, fragrance, ci no.59040 pyranine conc, ci no.73015 indigo carmine, \n\n- [KUSATSU] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminum silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [NOBORIBETSU] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, dextrin, calcium carbonate, silica, potassium chloride, fragrance.\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- These come in small packets.  The packets are color coded but there is no English labeling so it was hard for me to judge the individual varieties.  TBH, all 9 varieties (4 milky, 5 clear) seem very similar to one another in terms of scent.  Many of them smelled fruity, similar to the Pez candy smell of the Bath Roman Muddy Blue. The only real differences I could observe were the obvious ones: the color and whether the water looked milky or clear.  The results really didn’t seem to differ all that much.   They all smell pleasant and do a nice job relaxing sore muscles.\n\n\n**TL;DR** \n\n- The first one I tried was Bath Roman Muddy White, and it got me hooked!   The Bath Roman Muddy and Hinoki varieties were my favorites overall.  They all made my skin silky smooth, relaxed my tired muscles and seem to hold the heat of the bath water longer.  My favorite is still the Muddy White because I adore the scent.\n\n- Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe was my least favorite of all of them because of its scent.  \n\n- All of them made for a relaxing bath experience, which is really all that I expect out of this type of product.  Unfortunately, hot springs powders are no substitute for the real thing.  That said, these are still fantastic products for soothing sore muscles and stress relief!\n\nEdited formatting & added bonus cat pic",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Even when i was  in the flight my skin did not dry out at all ! \n\n\n     ▫️The days i used hydrating serums my skin looked so plump and glowy the next morning,  I couldn't stop admiring it XD \n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES ?\n\n\n       ▫️ Rosehip oil , followed by any moisturiser and slugging . This provides overnight results.\n\n \n\n      ▫️Rosehip oil pretty much provides the same effect and a small bottle of 30 ml runs a really long way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹  COMPARISON BETWEEN MARULA OIL AND ROSE HIP OIL\n\n \n\n\n\n___ |Rosehip oil|Morula oil\n|:-|:-|:-|\nfatty acids*****|more Linoleic acid and less Oleic Acid|more Oleic acid and less Linoleic acid\nantixodiants| |higher in antioxidants\ntexture|lighter / sinks into the skin|thicker / feels heavier\ncomedogenic rating|low|high\nbrightening properties ( scars )|yes|no\nantibacterial properties|yes|no\n\n\n\n 🔸*****\n\n\n\n\n *🔸you have oily or acne-prone skin, you likely have low levels of linoleic acid in your skin and therefore can benefit from a facial oil that’s high in linoleic acid*\n\n\n*🔸As a general rule, if you’re acne-prone or oily, you want an oil that’s high in linoleic acid. Whereas if you have dry skin, an oil that’s high in Oleic acid will help you more*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹 REPURCHASE STATUS \n\n\n        ▫️ WNRP\n\n\n        ▫️ Its a great moisturiser but rosehip oil provides the same effect , doesnt leave a heavy feeling post application. \n\n\n       ▫️for dry scaly patches i swear by the slugging method",

Climate: hot and humid (SC, USA).\n\n**Product info:** Japanese, SPF 50+ PA+++, free of alcohol, fragrance, essential oils, and niacinamide. Truly a milky texture. Combination sunscreen (meaning both mineral and chemical filters).\n\n**Ingredient list:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BG, Diethylhexyl Succinate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Hydrated Silica, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Lauroyl Lysine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Triethoxysilylethyl Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Hexyl Dimethicone, Methylparaben, EDTA-2Na, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Arginine, Bis-Ethylhexyl Hydroxydimethoxy Benzylmalonate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Acrylates Copolymer, CI 73360, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Talc, Ethanol, Iron Oxides, Tin Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tocopherol, Mica \n\n**My experience with it:** This is the best SPF I've ever tried! I've tried quite a few in my search of the perfect SPF, and nothing has been able to beat this. No white cast on me. I've never experienced pilling or any sort of irritation from it. It wears beautifully under makeup. Easy to blend as it is a truly milky texture. This is truly fragrance free - smells like nothing to me. Natural finish on me but I've read some people have a matte finish with it. I have used this since January of this year (2023). \n\n**Potential con:** I've read some people anecdotally notice getting sun with this product. I haven't noticed this, but I honestly avoid the sun as much as possible. I'd love to hear from those who experience this!\n\n**A true con:** the wimpy size of the bottle. 40 mL is so small! Alas, I'll continue to repurchase. The price is affordable for me (\\~$11 a bottle).\n\n**Another SPF I also love:** Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF 50+ PA++++.",

There are a few serious YouTuber’s (one who is a derm in Houston) who breaks the ingredients down during her vids and is sensitive to those with sensitivities (ex- niacinmide). Her name is Dr.Dray. I recommend giving a listen. She also covers many Asian products both chemical, mineral & hybrid. She also puts links( to sites and stores and is not compensated).

    "body": "as discussed in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5aqahi/unpopular_opinions_fall_2016_edition/), the [four-product starter haul](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4gltx6/newbies_why_your_first_haul_should_only_have_four/) that is currently subreddit gospel may not apply well to people with dry skin. herewith, after some discussion with various folks including /u/C_Chrono and /u/theCuriousAmerican, a proposed starter haul guide for dry-skinned newbies.\n\n---------------------\n\nARE YOU A DRY-SKINNED PERSON WHO IS NEW TO AB AND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO BUY?\n\ntry these 4 (well, 5) products first, numbered in the order in which to introduce them to your skincare routine. buy samples or decants on /r/asianbeautyexchange if you can--it's cheaper than buying full-sized products that turn out not to be right for you. introduce things *one at a time*, at least a few days apart; isolating changes to your routine lets you see what's helping/hurting. (you are \"supposed\" to patch test for two weeks to see if something irritates you, especially if acne-prone.) if anything tingles, burns, or causes bumps/clogged pores, stop using it immediately: none of these ingredients are \"actives\" (i.e., chemical exfoliants) and therefore cannot cause purging, so it's irritation. now, to the products! \n\n---------------------\n\n**the tl;dr version.** if you really just want a list of stuff to try first without all the explanations and potential variations, here are some recs that may or may not work for your specific face. \n\nAM: \ndon't wash your face; spritz with water or swipe with simple brand micellar water (if the pH of your tap water is high--more on this in the comments)\n\napply kikumasamune lotion high moist (via spray bottle or with your hands--it's a thin liquid despite the name)\n\napply cerave cream in the tub or dr. jart+ceramidin cream\n\napply canmake mermaid uv gel or another alcohol-free sunscreen\n\nPM: clean your sunscreen and/or makeup off with either banila co clean it zero cleanser, simple brand micellar water, or a cleansing milk/cream (see discussion in the comments)\n\nspritz with water (if the pH isn't too high)\n\napply kikumasamune lotion high moist\n\n[sheet mask if you want]\n\napply cerave/dr jart cream or (if everything else irritates you or you're really dry) vaseline\n\n---------------------\n\n**the long version: products to buy (decants of) first, and introduce one at a time, in this order***\n\n(1) A HYDRATING TONER (/\"LOTION,\" IF JAPANESE)\n\n* what? a thin liquid product containing humectants, ingredients that draw moisture to the skin. common humectants are glycerin, butylene glycol, propylene glycol, and hyaluronic acid. you will use this both morning and night.\n\n* why? to help hydrate your skin; many dry-skinned people have skin that doesn't produce much oil (\"dry\"), and many also have skin that doesn't contain much water (\"dehydrated\"). a hydrator can make your skin more comfortable quickly.\n\n* how do i choose which one(s) to buy? \n\n(a) have you ever had a bad reaction to skincare products in the past? check out the ingredient lists and see if there are ingredients in common--those might be problems for you. if you have a sensitivity to butylene glycol, your best bet may be a non-AB product: **heritage rosewater and glycerine toner.** (if someone has a glycerine-only AB product to rec, shout in the comments and i'll update!) \n\n(b) too much hyaluronic acid(/sodium hyaluronate) can make you drier, so it might be less risky to go with one that doesn't have hyaluronic acid too high in the ingredient list (higher = more of it). **kikumasamune lotion high moist** is extremely popular in this sub and is HA-free. so is the non-AB **mario badescu rosewater aloe herb spray**, which is cheap and easy to obtain in stores in the US (at ulta, for example).\n\n(c) is your skin damaged, peeling, or flaky? if so, it will benefit from ceramides+cholesterol (skin-repairing ingredients) in addition to a humectant. **rosette ceramide lotion and meishoku ceracolla lotion** have that ingredient combination--NOT the gels from the same lines, the \"lotions\" (liquids).\n\n(d) there are many other beloved potential options if you feel up for some research. if you are in europe and open to something non-AB, /u/Ronrinesu's got [an idea for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5koy14/4product_starter_haul_dry_skin_edition/dbqj2ok/).\n\n---------------------\n\n(2) A MOISTURIZER (\"cream,\" \"emulsion\") \n* what: a thing containing some amount of oil to \"seal in\" (occlude) the moisture (water) you are adding to your face with step 1, or else it will dry right back out again. you will use this after your toner both morning *and* night. \n\n* why: dry skin is lacking oil. oil helps seal in water and make your skin soft and able to like, move around without cracking. you need oil.\n\n* how do i decide which one to buy?\n\n(a) [this awesome post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) lists occlusive ingredients, i.e., those that help seal in moisture. you will want to look for creams that contain ingredients like this.\n\n(b) as with toners, if your skin is flaky or peely, you will want a cream with ceramides+cholesterol. many people swear by **cerave \"in the tub.\"** you may prefer the more-expensive but really wonderful **dr. jart+ ceramidin cream.**\n\nlet me explain: CREAMS ARE A MINEFIELD. a lot of ingredients in moisturizers cause sensitivities for certain people, including:\n\n(i) fatty alcohols (benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, etc., etc., etc.) -- if you have a sensitivity to these, you may want to try just a plant oil, since moisturizing creams without them are hard to find. people love **rosehip, argan, and camellia/green tea seed oil**, among many other possible contenders.\n(ii) beeswax (if a cream causes breakouts, this could be a contributing factor)\n(iii) plant oils, e.g., shea butter, coconut oil, sunflower oil, argan oil, rosehip oil, etc. (but a lot of people's skin LOVES one or more plant oils, so don't assume anything about yourself without experience--just be aware that if you're getting bumps, breakouts, or irritation, a plant oil could be the culprit)\n(iv) coconut derivatives like capric/caprylic triglycerides\n\nultimately, you need to obtain small amounts of various creams and oils to test on your skin to see which of these sensitivities you have. start your research on creams with [this awesome list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4xwoe1/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series_dry/) from dry-skinned folks (look under \"gels, emulsions, creams, lotions...\") \n\n(c) if creams are irritating your skin and you need *something* to hold you over until you figure out which ingredients to avoid: straight-up **vaseline** is *the* gold standard for reducing trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), and you can buy a tiny pot of it without making a big monetary commitment. yes, it is derived from petroleum; no, it is not toxic (purified for cosmetic use) or comedogenic (unlike plant oils, its molecular size is too big for it to clog pores). (only caveat is that it doesn't play well with sunscreen, so you'll need to find something else for daytime before you get to that step.) plain **mineral oil** also works pretty well (and feels less gross than vaseline); if you're in the US, snow river's wood oil is a plain, unscented mineral oil you can get for like, $4.\n\n---------------------\n\n(3) A GENTLE CLEANSER \n\n* what: a low-pH micellar water (check the original first-four post if you want a quick overview of why low pH is important), an oil-based cleanser that emulsifies (washes off) well, (ETA) or a cream or milk cleanser. (ETA:) *not* a foaming cleanser (harsh; you want to be gentle to your skin).\n\n* why? many western cleansers have a pH that is high enough to irritate skin or don't properly remove makeup and sunscreen. that basically means just washing your face stresses your skin. a cleanser that starts you off on a good footing can improve the overall situation.\n\n* how do i decide which ones to buy? if you don't mind scents and oil, i recommend you start with **banila co clean it zero** (in the US, you can buy sample/travel sizes on amazon for something like $2.50, in addition to decants available on /r/asianbeautyexchange). if mineral oil irritates your skin (rare but possible), the \"purity\" version doesn't contain it.\n\nif you want something you can buy in US drugstores, an oil-free option, or something you can swipe on with a cotton pad, **simple's micellar water** is a popular alternative (other micellar waters have high pHes--don't substitute).\n\n(ETA:) if you are ready to do some research to choose your own cleanser (highly recommended!), see the comments below for a long discussion about cream cleansers and milk cleansers (some AB, some not). as you will see, many of the more vocal dry-skinned folk seem to prefer them to oil cleansers.\n\n---------------------\n\n(4) A PROBABLY ALCOHOL-FREE SUNSCREEN \n\n* what: a sunscreen which, to be on the safe side, contains no alcohol. (as mentioned below, not all but many of us dry folks are sensitive to alcohol.) \n\n* why: it's the main way to prevent dark spots, post-blemish scarring (PIH), and signs of aging. \n\n* how do i decide which one to buy? the most oft-recommended alcohol-free one is **canmake mermaid uv gel.** here are [some other suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/41y5s9/are_there_sunscreens_without_alcohol/). \n\n---------------------\n\n(5) BONUS ROUND because you can't be a total monk about your first haul: SHEET MASKS, if you want 'em\n\n* what? single-use fabric masks soaked in hydrating \"essence.\" \n\n* why? the fabric sheet acts as a physical occlusive to hold water onto your skin. the single serving means you can try various ingredient combinations without a big commitment. (yes, the packaging is wasteful. yes, a lot of them are expensive. yes, it's ridiculous that they're single-use. if you're not into it, ignore this part and count your saved money!)\n\n* how do i decide which ones to buy? (make sure to isolate introductions of masks as you would other products; don't do two new things at the same time.)\n\n(a) do you mind heavily scented things? that will narrow the field a lot. (searching for unscented sheet masks should get you on the right path quickly.)\n\n(b) next, narrow your search by your other skin concerns, e.g., calming, brightening, anti-acne. or check out the favorites on beloved blogs like fifty shades of snail, vanity rex, and 35th of may, whose proprietors are members of this sub (the last two have dry skin).\n\n(c) check ingredient lists to help you avoid alcohol high in the ingredient list. (for example, innisfree it's real masks are sort of notorious for alcohol content.)\n\n(d) do you want my idiosyncratic and highly personal recommendations? here you go: **illi camellia** (contains camellia/green tea seed oil); **tosowoong dr. troubex** (a nice introduction to fermented ingredients, with lots of calming things like centella and licorice); anything **lululun** (they come in multi-packs and have less essence, which i personally prefer); **elizavecca donkey steam cream masks** (these are one of a kind--coated in thick cream, not \"essence\"). all of these are available by the box in the US on amazon, mostly for $1.50/sheet or less, or you can find some singly at memebox or /r/asianbeautyexchange.\n\n---------------------\n\nPRO TIPS FOR CARING FOR DRY SKIN:\n\n(1) you may not need to actually *wash* your face in the morning. many of us just splash with water. (ETA:) the water where you live may have a too-high pH. you might want to swipe with the micellar water (the pH of which is consistent and low enough, unlike that of tap or bottled water) instead.\n\n(2) spritz your face with a spray bottle of water as the first step in the routine. (it gives humectants something to draw into your skin.)\n\n(3) you may have a sensitivity to ethanol/\"alcohol\"/denatured alcohol/\"alcohol denat\" high on ingredient lists. not all of us do, but a lot of us do. \n\n(4) abandon any preconceptions that heavy night creams will cause breakouts. irritating ingredients will; occlusion on dry skin will not. \n\n(5) a lot of people put toner on their lips and then seal it in with lip balm. this may not be FDA approved, but it can really help with the dryness.\n\nhappy hunting!",

The only thing I would suggest, is to check your water's pH level as well, especially if you are just splashing water for one of your cleansing sessions. It took me a while to figure this out. I think I was reading a review on Fiftyshadesofsnails where she mentioned being surprised how high her water's pH was, and something clicked. When I tested mine, it was in the 8-9ish range! So sometimes even just splashing water can irritate the face just as easily as those high pH cleansers. I switched to a quick swipe of Simple's micellar water in the morning instead, and the difference in my skin was astounding. So yeah, just wanted to put that out there, because your water is usually the last culprit you would expect!",

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.

A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Crème\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.  Pictured above. Feels heavy for a lotion.\n\n**Ingredient List :**[Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), 🌟[**Zinc Oxide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide)**,** [Sorbitan Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-stearate), [PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-30-dipolyhydroxystearate), [Butylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butylene-glycol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Copper Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/copper-sulfate), 🌟 [**Mannitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol)**,** [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), 🌟 [**Xylitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol)**,** [Zinc Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-sulfate), [Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Vine Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/vitis-vinifera-vine-extract), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose),[Laureth-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-3), 🌟[**Asiaticoside**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiaticoside)**, 🌟**[**Madecassic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/madecassic-acid)**, 🌟** [**Asiatic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiatic-acid), [Hydroxyethylcellulose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethylcellulose), [Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract)\n\n**Fragrance:** A subtler version of that greasy smell, a teeny bit herbal, to be this dissipates the quickest of all the bioderma moisturisers.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  😍 I love it. I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

It does *taste* kind of sugary if I accidentally get some in my mouth while applying. Idk why I just said that publicly. Anyway",

(or if you already have, congrats!) . anyway , this is a list of all the humectants that I have tried. some worked great, some were a waste of money and some were mediocre. I will be rating them for convenience and will also be mentioning the price .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**what is a humectant ?**\n\nwater-loving ingredients that draw moisture into the stratum corneum, the top layer of skin, whether through the environment or through the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) (net se hai 🤡👌)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe list is divided into cleansers, toners ,serums, gels , moisturizers , creams , essence , emulsions for face. making one for body related products might a bit difficult but ill see! \n\n**list of commonly used humectants in skincare :**\n\n* hyaluronic acid (and types)\n* snail mucin\n* lactic acid\n* aloe vera\n* honey (propolis)\n* glycerin\n* propylene glycol (or propanediol)\n* butylene glycol\n* panthenol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**skin info** : F17\n\n**type** : dry/combination (earlier was oily combination, so the list has a combo of products) , acne-prone, have pit scars and acne marks and scars ( \\*insert dark kermit meme\\*: *scratch them pimples*)  blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : dry winter ( Delhi 🤡) and humid summers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhere we gooo!

dry, sensitive, combo , acne prone and oily\n\n**texture and appearance** : jelly-like , clear looking , smooth gel . lathers easily. unscented\n\nused this when I damaged my barrier 🤡 takes off excess oil without stripping and leaves skin soft and hydrated . extremally gentle . no dry or stretchy feeling left after (signs of dehydration )  more suited for dry and sensitive skin but works on all types! little hard to wash off if used in large amount , so pea size is enough!\n\n**status** : still in use.\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It's Skin Snail Blanc Brightening Cleansing Foam**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 490 for 100ml from nykka\n\n**humectant** : snail mucin (21% as it claims)\n\n**for skin types** : oily skin\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick, white and creamy (get your head outta the gutter), kind of like a ponds cleanser. lathers into marshmallow fluff. citrus scented\n\nhard no 🤡. extremely drying and stripping. wouldn't even recommend it for oily skin (but might work if you have it extremely oily) . strong scent and extremely irritating for sensitive and dry skin . aggravated my acne and burned like hell with a damaged barrier. as for normal skin, still might be quite stripping and make it quite dry but can be resolved using a hydrating toner (coming up!)\n\n**status** : still in use but only till it finishes. never buying again. using it as body wash lol.\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 305 (bought for Rs. 280) for 125ml from local pharmacy\n\n**humectant** : propylene glycol , glycerin, panthenol and pantolactone\n\n**for skin types** : dry, sensitive , combination , acne prone .\n\n**texture** : milky and lotion like . does not lather at all. unscented. kind of runny so be careful with portion control\n\nanother HG for dry, sensitive and irritated skin. very gentle and hydrating . dont even need water to activate it. might even work for oily skin but i didnt have such a pleasant experience with it when I had oily skin . left my skin more oily. but acted like god-sent when I had irritated skin!\n\n**status** : sometimes . very sparsely.\n\n**rating :** 4/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnext up, **toners**!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SNP Peptaronic toner**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 750 for 350ml from amazon\n\n**humectant** : hyaluronic acid ( sodium hyaluronate and sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer) , propylene glycol.\n\n**for skin types** : dry, sensitive , combination , oily\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick pink runny jelly like but liquidy when massaged on skin. very light floral scent. absorbs within 5 min.\n\nmy HG toner of all time. will never change this. not to mention it never runs out ( 5 months in and still on my first bottle lol). instantly hydrates after washing and is a great base for the rest of the routine. sometimes end my routine at toner when I'm too lazy . its just that good ! probably not gonna use their serum since I have serums for that. has mild fragrance so be careful!\n\n**status** : still in use and will always beee\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**emulsion** time!\n\n**Etude House Soonjung 10 Free Moist Emulsion**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. : 1250 for 120ml (Bought for Rs. 1000) from nykka\n\n**humectant** : glycerin, propanediol , butylene glycol and  panthenol\n\n**for skin type** : all! sensitive, dry, combination, oily and acne prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thin white lotion . unscented . takes a bit time to absorb fully.\n\na subreddit recommendation! really lotion like and not that hydrating. to me, it felt a bit heavy and sticky and for some reason, takes way too much time to sink in. once that's done, applying any serum feels heavy on my skin. on the hydration its moderate for me . haven't been using for that long (2 months) so lets see if the verdict changes!\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**essences**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TONYMOLY  The Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Essence**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1500 for 55ml ( bought for Rs. 750) from nykka\n\n**humectant** : cyclomethicone , propanediol and glycerin\n\n**for skin types** : all! sensitive, dry, combo, acne-prone , oily .\n\n**texture and appearance** : white gel-lotion like , watery when spread out. green tea smell but its probably natural since fragrance isn't mentioned in the product description and also that is 80% green tea extract.\n\nman did my wallet cry after buying it 🤡 really refreshing and fast absorbing. great for all types of skin. 2 pumps for whole skin and it does magic. really soothing and calms down the redness especially on days after bha . extremely hydrating for dry and sensitive skin as well as for oily and soothes acne bursts after dermaplaning. can very well be used as a supplement for hyaluronic acid !\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**COSRX Advanced Snail 96 mucin power essence**\n\n**Mrp :** Rs. 1450 for 100ml (bought for Rs. 1015) from maccaron\n\n**humectant** : snail mucin, butylene glycol , hyaluronic acid  and panthenol\n\n**for skin types** : all!

I tried the snail mucin from earth rhythm before this (simply, no and also coming up) and this is miles better than that. makes my skin very plumpy and soft . of course top it off with a gel and completes the routine on a lazy day lol. soothes all acne irritation and dryness . not sure how it will work on oily skin but a goody for all sensitive ,acne prone and dry bishes.\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Earth Rhythm Renew Overnight Gel with 70% Snail Mucin**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 900 for 50ml (bought for Rs. 600) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : snail mucin , hyaluronic acid, aloe vera juice and acetamido ethoxyethanol\n\n**for skin types** : normal and oily\n\n**texture and appearance** : cloudy thin gel . feels kind of watery . unscented.\n\nwhat a waste of money. 1 out of 2 earth rhythm products I tried and both of them broke me out and are clown realness  🤡. it feels like thin coat of Vaseline on the face and even though its a sleeping mask its not hydrating (thought id mention it in essences since its the only sleeping mask w/ humectants I have lol) and sure as hell doesn't calm the skin. made my acne worse and just doesn't fulfill its purpose. wouldn't recommend to anyone .\n\n**status** :  not in use\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**serums**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nget ready for a bandwagon of hyaluronic acid variations XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**minimalist hyaluronic acid 2% + vitamin B4**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 500) from beminimalist\n\n**humectant**: hyaluronic acid, aloe vera juice, panthenol, propanediol and ethoxydiglycol.\n\n**for skin types** ; all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick clear liquid . unscented .\n\nhydrating goodness! first was using it on dry skin but works the best on damp skin. absorbs really quickly and was my first hyaluronic acid serum. used more than required so ran out of it pretty quickly but around  5 drops are enough for the whole face. great for anyone really , so versatile!\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**deconstruct hydrating serum**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 500) from amazon\n\n**humectants** : hyaluronic acid , butylene glycol, anhydroxylitol , xylitol , xylitylglucoside  and sodium gluconate\n\n**for skin types** : all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick clear liquid kind of like cosrx snail mucin . unscented but mine somehow had a cardboard like smell .\n\ngood! overall I had a better experience with minimalist . this serum was just a bit too heavy and greasy for me . it took a really long time for it to absorb and sometimes just sat on the skin. and plus the smell was a bit nauseating . but al in all , it gave good hydration . stinged a bit when skin was irritated so not the biggest fan of this.\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neutrogena hydro boost capsule in serum**\n\n**Mrp :** Rs. 800 for 30 ml (bought for Rs. 720) from nykka\n\n**humectants :** glycerin, propanediol, butylene glycol, caprylyl glycol, panthenol, hyaluronic acid , sucrose and pca.\n\n**for skin types** : all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thin gel like . capsules are powdery but when mixed with gel , they disappear. heavily scented so wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin.\n\nliteral money-bait. did absolutely nothing. and felt so guilty after buying it ! its alternative hydro boost gel was so much better! (also coming up) don't even remember this one clearly, but much expected difference wasn't seen , sadly.\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**L'Oréal  Revitalift 1.5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 999 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 550) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, hyaluronic acid and pentalene glycol\n\n**for skin types** : all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : clear liquid . unscented.\n\nHG HA acid forever!! finally found it! tried the 15ml variant first and loved it instantly . super hydrating and soothing. not sticky and absorbs within 2-3 minutes. great base for the whole routine and still going on after 3 months ! not irritating or stingy on sensitive skin at all as well as good for oily skin too since its a lower concentration! loveeee\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NEW!*** **minimalist lactic acid 10% + HA 1%**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 570)\n\n**humectants** : lactic acid , aloe vera juice, hyaluronic acid, propanediol, ethoxydiglycol, glycerin.\n\n**for skin types** : TBD\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale-clear yellow . sour scent but no added perfume. really thin and watery.\n\njust got this . will update in a few months !\n\n**status** : TBD\n\n**rating** : TBD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NEW!*** **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Water Essence Serum**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1790 for 50ml (bought for Rs. 1253) from maccaron\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, hyaluronic acid , betaine, sodium pca, trehalose, panthenol, pentalene glycol, butylene glycol, beta-glucan and polyquaternium-51 .\n\n**for skin types** : TBD\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid . unscented.\n\njust got this , so verdict is coming soon!\n\n**status** : TBD\n\n**rating** : TBD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**gels**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pond's Super Light Gel**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 430 for 247gm (bought for Rs. 365) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, butylene glycol, sodium pca, hyaluronic acid, pentylene glycol\n\n**for skin types** : dry, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : light blue liquidy-gel . heavily scented  ( has different citrus extracts) .\n\ngood! really lightweight and hydrating. has a very heavy citrus like smell and definitely wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin. isn't greasy at all and absorbs well. great for both winters and summers and even use it on my body!\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neutrogena hydro boost water gel**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1000 for 50 ml ( bought for Rs. 855) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, butylene glycol, dimethiconol , hyaluronic acid\n\n**for skin types** : dry , oily, combination and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : light blue liquidy-gel . scented .\n\namazingggg! could've been my HG if it wasn't for the price 🤡. still really hydrating and light. best gel for acne-prone skin as it really decreased the no. of outbreaks and soothes all aggravation. again is scented, so not the best choice for sensitive skin. prefer this over ponds but the cost sis 🥲\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**moisturizers**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 400 for 45ml (bought for Rs. 360) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, pentylene glycol , xylitol, caprylyl glycol, mannitol , rhamnose and fructooligosachharides.\n\n**for skin types** : dry , sensitive and acne-prone.\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. unscented.\n\ngodsent. literally. HG moisturizer besides Cetaphil DAM (cheaper alternative) . boon for sensitive and dehydrated skin. skin saver during my whole tretinoin journey. extremely hydrating and soothing. works similar to boroline on dry patches around nose and mouth . and non-pore clogging! admittedly a little heavy and non-absorbing which is why I might not use it in summers.\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all from my side !!also I did not use all of these products at the same time. I'm writing everything from memory since some products were used +3 years ago . even those still in use, I alternate between them on days since I don't need to apply them everyday and all. so most of my products last for a very long time since I combined them and alternate between them. of course, patch test first and thankfully, none of them reacted in a bad way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsuggestions from the subreddit \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfollowing products were subreddit recs and I haven't used them at all , so ya'll can search more about them an maybe give them a try!\n\n* irem hyaluronic acid serum (HA)\n* pyungkang yul mist toner\n* inkey list polyglutamic acid\n* herbivore cloud jelly serum\n* the ordinary NMF moisturizer\n\nthere are a lot more but I'm too lazy to read all of them . do mention your HG in the comments!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthere are many other humectants that I haven't mentioned , like niacinamide which is present in trace amounts in almost all products. personally, never tried any products with honey extract in it (I figured snail mucin does a better job , but who knows) . for newer products, ill update them one I'm done trying them for at least 2 months (or let me know if you guys want it any earlier , I got no issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway I hope this list helps out ! I didn't have any knowledge about humectants while my skin was being tortured by over-exfoliation and I was looking like a baboon's ass so take care of your skin so it doesn't look like this 🥵 also this took a long time , so leaving an upvote will feel nice 🥰",

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

I know that the brand [ATrue](https://www.cupidrop.com/collections/a-true/products/black-tea-true-active-essence) uses fermented tea in some of their products but it's not too emphasized. Thanks for highlighting the scientific names in the ingredient list! I'm still trying to familiarize myself with all these terms.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "Here is the routine that my skin has come to make peace with since the last 8 months after years of perfunctory experiments it endured. I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

    "body": " \n\nThis is my first time doing a comparison post, so please bear with me. I really hope this post is well organised and everyone finds it an informational and entertaining read. I have been wanting to do this comparison since the minimalist released its peel, and I finally got the chance to that. I have uploaded a video and images for the comparison but I'll first start with the review.\n\nReview\n\n* *Your skin type-* Sahara desert dry skin\n* *Your current climatic conditions-* Hot af\n* *Your current AM/PM routine-*  \n**AM**\\- Nothing, I only apply sunscreen if have to go out  \n**PM**\\- Ponds cold cream (for my double cleanse), cleanser (Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser), tret (twice a week), ordinary peeling solution (once a month), innisfree jeju volcanic mask (once a month), moisturizer (I have like 4-5 moisturizers that I use)\n* *Your age- 22*\n\n**The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* More than a year\n* *Ingredient List-* Glycolic Acid, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Daucus Carota Sativa Extract, Propanediol, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Potassium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Polysorbate 20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n* *Holy Grail but Will Not Repurchase-* I fucking love it, it made my skin so smooth and my complexion brighter. I never had any skin problems before as such, but it just made everything better. I never experienced any sort of purging or irritation with this peel. Although, I will not be repurchasing it because I paid ₹1200 for this even though it lasted more than a year. The availability is an issue too.\n\n**Minimalist AHA BHA PHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* 2 times\n* *Ingredient List-* Aloe Vera Juice, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Gluconolactone, Mandelic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lecithin\n* *Holy Grail but Will Repurchase-* I loved it in the very first go, I saw immediate results much like the ordinary. I did not experience any sort of irritation or purging with this either. I honestly don't have much to say because the results are pretty much identical for both.\n\nComparison\n\n**Texture**\n\nAs you can see in the video below, apart from the colour difference the minimalist one a bit flowier than the ordinary. Also, I like the shape of the dropper of the minimalist one, it's pointy rather than the round tip and it looks classier ( at least to my eyes). That is really it when it comes to the texture and the feel of the products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/mobbuo/video/dxwg1bxpdes61/player\n\n**Application**\n\n*note- i forgot to take my before pics, pls forgive a newbie 😔😔😔*\n\nI did a half-n-half application of the peels. The immediate thing I noticed was the way they applied, ordinary being thicker is slightly easier to spread because it doesn't drip as much as the minimalist.\n\nAlso, idk what it is about minimalist peel but I had to apply it a tad bit more than its counterpart.\n\nThird, minimalist did not burn AT ALL while the ordinary always burns a little, even after a year of consistent use.\n\nIn the images below you can see my skin right after the application of the peels, the results are very much the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kdr544sdes61.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8425c82498afb958897ee5482979129fdc1c07d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion-** I like both, I don't have a preference for one over the other when it comes to the results. The only thing is that minimalist is cheaper and easily available, so I will go for that one instead of the ordinary.",

    "body": "Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing.

This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things.

What I meant is that HA and various forms of it are not the main ingredient since products that are HA focused usually contain varying HA molecular weights that can cause breakouts( ex.hada labo, isntree ha toner) or are too drying for certain climates. So something like a snail, propolis, or centalla product with sodium hyaluronate down the ingredients would be fine. thank you :)",

(It’s also a helpful product for calming irritation/rashes.)\n\nOn a related topic, if you’re looking for a humectant to replace HA, I recommend using aloe vera. I’ve had good experiences with the Holika Holika 99% Soothing Gel.\n\nEdit: I had to double check the ingredient lists, but I also recommend Etude House’s hypoallergenic line, Soon Jung. Their products are focused on panthenol and madecassoside rather than HA. I use their toner and emulsion during the drier months.",

    "body": "Hello! So 2020 was the year I finally really got into skincare, and especially AB skincare. My skin type is oily-combination and I mostly struggle with dehydration and CCs. I live in a tropical country, so it’s summer and hot/humid all year long, so most of the products I used were lightweight and focused on hydration and soothing. This review will be (almost) all of the skincare I tried this year, hopefully it is informative enough and can be beneficial!\n\n\n\n**PURITO** ***Defence Barrier pH Cleanser***: Gel cleanser with a pH of 5.5, contains tea tree (you can kind of smell it), centella and royal jelly. It’s a viscous, slightly runny thick clear gel that lathers but does not foam. I don’t know why though this broke me out :( My skin did not feel tight at all, but I think it does not cleanse enough so instead left a stubborn trail off CCs along my cheek, and after months I am still trying to heal from it. Heard really good things about it but maybe not for me :( **2/5 WNRP**\n\n**Hada Labo** ***Tamagohada AHA+BHA Mild Exfoliating Face Wash***: Tried this in an attempt to help my CCs since I can’t find other SA face washes where I live. Thick, white paste that lathers and does not foam that much. Honestly don’t think it exfoliates at all since it’s wash off, and the packaging indicates there is only 0.98% AHA (glycolic acid), and the BHA (salicylic acid) is even lower in the ingredients list. It’s a bit stripping, and although it did not break me out, it did not do anything either. **2/5 WNRP**\n\n**Senka** ***Perfect Whip Facial Cleansing Foam***: This was the cleanser I used before going into skincare. I heard it has high pH, and even though my face never felt tight it does always make that squeaky sound after cleansing if you rub your hands on your face? Haha. This foams a lot and the foam does keep up for a long time. Definitely does not recommend for sensitive skin, as it could be overly stripping, but since it does not break me out, I will have to keep using it until I find a better cleanser. **2.5/5 WRP**\n\n**COSRX** ***One Step Original Clear Pad***: This was first exfoliating pad. It contains willowbark water (a form of BHA), tea tree and betaine salicylate. The pads are textured with slightly raised dots so it physically exfoliates as well. It contains 70 sheets so sometimes I stick a few around my face and leave them like a sheet mask. It definitely helped a bit with managing breakouts and a bit on skin texture, though there is no huge difference as it is very mild chemical exfoliation. Definitely thankful I started chemical exfoliation with this as it is very gentle, but now I think I’d use a slightly stronger one. **4/5 WNRP**\n\n**Wishtrend** ***Mandelic Acid 5% Skin Prep Water***: This was my first sole AHA. It’s a runny and watery, has a slight like medicine smell. It contains centella, hottuynia cordata, licorice root extract, beta glucan, panthenol, and sodium hyaluronate in addition to the AHA, which I honestly feel more benefits from than the exfoliation itself haha. It is very hydrating, but from an exfoliation standpoint I think it is quite too mild (probably because the mandelic acid molecules are larger relative to other AHAs) so it did not seem to do much. **3.5/5 WNRP**\n\n**Benton** ***Snail Bee High Content Essence***: A thick, clear essence that looks more like a serum but it applies like water. This contains snail mucin, bee venom, willowbark extract, and a couple other plant extracts, and it has no scent. I had really high hopes since I saw many reviews saying the product tremendously helped their breakouts but aside from hydrating a bit it did not really do anything on my face. **3/5 WNRP**\n\n**COSRX** ***Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence***: The super hyped super popular essence with 96% snail mucin. This is the most hydrating product I’ve ever used, has a clear, slimy (sorry;-;) texture but once you apply it, the slimy feeling goes away. I think I have to go against the crowd here, honestly this product leaves like a oily(?) film for a long time and does not sink in well. Initially cleared some CCs on my forehead and had really positive results, though after three months of constant use, it broke me out on my cheeks, which is a huge pity. I will mourn for this forever. **3/5 WNRP**\n\n**PURITO** ***Centella Green Level Buffet Serum***: Accidentally bought the scented instead of the unscented but it was okay. This has a gel consistency similar to the Benton essence, contains 49% centella extract, peptides, niacinamide, green tea extract, panthenol and ceramides. It does not do anything to breakouts but is very hydrating and is incredible in relieving redness and soothing irritations. **4/5 MRP**\n\n**Dr Ceuracle** ***Royal Vita 33 Propolis Ampoule***: Okay for a broke student like me, this definitely broke the bank considering the tiny 15ml bottle that barely lasted over two months even when I use just a drop or two every day. It’s definitely a very concentrated, viscous ampoule, and it has a slight sweet scent, like honey. I think I put my expectations too high here reading the reviews haha- it’s definitely not a cure-all and did not help with acne/CCs. Though given the small amount I used, it was incredibly hydrating and I could see the “propolis glow” mentioned constantly, I was so scared my face would fall into a dehydrated, dull mess after I stopped using it. But honestly after months of not using it anymore, I don’t think it’s worth repurchasing if you’re short on budget like me🥲 **4/5 MRP**\n\n**Somethinc** ***AHA BHA PHA Peeling Solution***: Okay so this is a local brand from Indonesia, but they ship worldwide so I am including it here. So this is very similar to the TO AHA BHA solution, both also has the daucus carota sativa extract to make them red, but this one has a far lower percentage and therefore is more gentle. It contains 3% AHA, 1% BHA and 2% PHA, and is far more runny than the one from TO. Although it is advised to be used once a week and washed off, since it’s mild, I am able to use it 1x/3 days without washing it off. This + the dokdo lotion were game changers this year, cleared up a huge lot of my stubborn CCs without compromising my skin barrier at all. **5/5 WRP**\n\n**Round Lab** ***1025 Dokdo Lotion***: THIS. This is the dream moisturizer I do not deserve. It’s a very lightweight lotion similar to the Hada Labo Gokujyun Milk but with the sea water and more beneficial plant extracts (including centella, licorice root and chamomile) and squalane, that literally becomes water when you spread it. It sinks in quickly and is not sticky at all, is incredibly hydrating AND moisturizing (a bit more than the Soon Jung emulsion) that I don’t need to add any thicker moisturizer, and for some reason it somehow helped with skin texture issues. **10/5 oops, HG WRP**\n\n**Illiyoon** ***Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream***: A very thick cream that does not feel too heavy and sinks in relatively quickly. I bought the 200ml size and it lasts a very long time, even when I used it for both my body and face. Since my face is oily-combination, it is quite too heavy for me, so I apply this while my face is still damp with a toner. Its definitely soothing and moisturizing enough for dry skin, and I’ve heard people use this on babies, so I can easily recommend this for all skin types. **4.5/5 MRP**\n\n**KOSE** ***Suncut UV Protect Spray***: I love using spray sunscreen as it is super simple and trouble-free.   This one claims to have SPF 50+ PA++++. It does leave a slight shiny film on top of your face but is not really a huge bother as it did not break me out and will sink down after. It is transparent and does not leave any white cast, and is especially nice for touching up throughout the day, even if you are wearing make up. A con would be that its quite expensive for a 60gr bottle, and also there is a risk of not applying enough/evenly as it is sprayed. **4.5/5 MRP**\n\n**Innisfree** ***Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask 2x***: This 100ml tub honestly lasts a very long time. It’s a clay mask but it also contains AHA to help with skin texture. It has a thick but spreadable consistency and somehow feels cooling to the face when applied. I use this once every few days in a thin layer and most of the time there really were visible differences in minimizing the appearance of pores. **4/5 MRP**\n\n**Lululun** ***Facial Sheet Mask - White***: I got the pack of 7, which was a deal honestly. The sheets are thick but the face sizes are the smallest I’ve ever used. The amount of essence is moderate. It’s moisturizing so I sometimes skip my moisturizer and just use this for the night. But aside from that I did not see any brightening properties from this white version. **3/5 MRP**\n\n**Mediheal** ***Meience Sheet Masks***: The first and only mediheal masks I’ve ever gotten as the other types are quite more expensive :(, but I am hooked. The essences in these masks are very abundant, I ended up using the rest for my arms. The sheets are of different components for each of the four different masks. The morning after I used this my pores were far less visible, the texture on my face lessened a lot, and a growing pimple I had calmed down. I don’t know what sort of magic mediheal has, but I will definitely look into their other ones after this. **5/5 WRP**\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading, have a great day!",

    "body": "**Cosrx Snail Mucin Review (Long Term Usage; 2+ years)**\n\n**About me**: 25 F; I have combination skin with an oily T zone in summers and dry cheeks and nose in winters\n\n**Skin concerns**: Cystic acne; scars, hyperpigmentation *and* *crying* from the cystic acne\n\nMy routine(for winter)\n\n**AM;** Cerave cream to foam hydrating cleanser> Hada Labo premium lotion> melano cc essence> sunscreen (Thank you farmer, BOJ or supergoop play)\n\n**PM**; Klairs cleansing oil or The body shop cleansing balm> Cerave Acne foaming facewash> Cosrx Snail Mucin> Laniege Cica sleeping mask/Cosrx AIO Snail cream/Bioderma Atoderm Baume\n\nSpot treatments and things I use occasionally: Aziderm 10% gel, BP 2.5% gel, Cos de baha Tranexamic acid, Cosrx BHA\n\n**Purchased from**: Maccaron\n\nProduct link:  [https://maccaron.in/en/products/cosrx\\_advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence-100ml/942/](https://maccaron.in/en/products/cosrx_advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence-100ml/942/)\n\n**tl;dr I WILL TAKE A BOTTLE OF SNAIL MUCIN WITH ME WHEN I GO TO HELL**\n\nTexture: It's transparent in colour and has no fragrance. The texture is slightly thick and gooey(but not gross)\n\nApplication: I use 3-4 pumps for my whole face. I apply it on wet dripping face right after cleanser in the evening. On some days I layer it twice. My skin drinks it up as soon as I apply it. It spreads easily on wet skin. On dry skin it doesn't fully absorb and sits on the skin.\n\nI love it. I bought 9 bottles so far. And gifted three to my friends. You can see 4 in the photo. I gave away the old ones for recycling. I use it every day in my PM routine during winters. It helps keep my skin hydrated in dry weather. If i go a week without using it, I can feel the difference. Skin feels tight and not as glowy when i wake up. I always take it for travelling. It's helpful during flights and while staying in hotel rooms where my skin feels most dehydrated.\n\n***10/10 Will repurchase , Holy Grail!***\n\nSorry for any mistakes. This is my first review. English is hard. Please be nice.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the product, do ask.\n\nIngredient list:  Snail Secretion Filtrate, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Carbomer, Panthenol, Arginine\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kji0qunq126c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ce0d4f723574305d1432788265475e90018dca3",

The snails are kept in a safe place while they recover and then are released back to their homes.\n\nIn another process, snail shells get cracked and the snail bodies are removed.

    "body": " \n\n**Product**: Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid + Niacinamide Serum (bought from Cos de Baha store on Amazon)\n\n**Ingredients**: \\*Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Ext., Tranexamic Acid, Niacinamide, Glycereth-26, Betaine, Propanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid,\\*Camellia Sinensis Leaf Ext,\\*Sambucus Nigra Flower Ext,\\*Momordica Charantia Fruit Ext,\\*Leontopodium Alpinum Ext. \\*Mark: N.O.I.P 78%\n\n**Skin type**: Very dry and prone to hormonal acne (deeper pustules; reddish bumps that do not come to a head mainly below nose/chin area). Had an extreme breakout during a period of high stress in my early 30s which left my face full of PIH which are several shades darker than my skin tone and PIE. The active breakout got under control thanks to 10% benzoyl peroxide cream and mega-dosing with Vitamin B5. Current goals are to completely eliminate old existing scars and keep my skin hydrated.\n\n**Climate**: humid subtropical according to Wikipedia (I live in the DC area)\n\n**Current routine**: AM-cold water rinse, Hadolabo Gokujyun Premium lotion followed by Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum, then COSRX Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence OR Iunik Beta Glucan Power Moisture Serum followed by Vanicream daily moisturizer for sensitive skin at the end for additional moisture (If anyone has AB recs for something more hydrating/penetrating that leaves your skin feeling moisturized longer than the Vanicream feel free to let me know lol. I have been rebuying in the meantime because it actually absorbs into my skin and doesn't irritate at all instead of sitting on top and feeling itchy/stingy which is what Clinique Dramtically Different Moisturizing Lotion did). I use 10% benzoyl peroxide or Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion as a spot treatment for when I do get the occasional pimple here and there. Biore Watery Essence as my SPF. \n\nPM- B.LAB Matcha Hydrating Foam Cleanser (I do not cleanse every day but every other day or only on days I wear makeup because I'm trying to avoid stripping additional moisture from my skin), same moisturizing routine as AM\n\n**Verdict**: I have been using this product daily for 4 weeks now. First I want to say my PIH left over from my breakouts years ago are several shades darker than my skin tone and have been extremely stubborn and unresponsive to a bunch of products over the years. I tried so many treatments from lower end like Ambi cream, Palmer fade and Mederma scar gel (I was clueless and in the trenches those days lmao) to pure Licorice root extract and Lancome Visionnaire Crescendo night peel. I also tried several Vitamin C serums. To this day, the ONLY products that have noticeably faded my PIH are Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC and now.... Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum! \n\n**Review:** Now onto the review! First of all I like that packaging-wise it's in a plastic and not glass vial (like Iunik Beta Glucan) since glass can shatter in the mail or when dropped, however I would prefer a squeeze tube like Melano CC so you can ensure you get to the last drop and not leave behind any product. The dropper application unfortunately leaves product at the bottom which is pretty wasteful considering it's only a fluid ounce. Unlike Melano CC and other Vitamin C serums, the serum texture is not oily at all but more of a viscuous liquid like a moisturizing toner. I think it's best applied on wet skin after cleansing/toning or rinsing with water. I haven't detected any scent or chemical smell. It is moisturizing and absorbs well into the skin and doesn't feel like a treatment or something acidic at all.\n\nI started noticing results somewhere between 2 and 3 weeks which is incredibly fast especially  considering my skin history. I have a particularly stubborn dark spot on my left lower cheek and it has lightened several shades and shrunk to half its original size. I imagine within another week or two it'll be completely gone. There was another stubborn cluster of PIH along my left jawline that has faded to the point where I can go without concealer or foundation on top of it.  In comparison Melano CC, which was very effective for me as well, took much longer, somewhere around at least 7 or 8 weeks before I saw noticeable results. \n\n**Price**: I paid 11.99 (12.71 with tax) from Amazon for 1 fluid ounce. I bought this over a month ago, however while writing this review I checked the price again and now it's $15.49 for two fluid ounces which is a much better deal, go figure. It is kind of pricey considering the small amount of product you get but IMO very well worth it. I will be rebuying and plan on gifting this to friends who also struggle with PIH!",

Sure, it looks a bit better now but that could also be because PIE fades by itself slowly overtime. Something that I love about this serum though is how soothing it is. My skin is very sensitive and whenever it's really red and burning, I find that applying this serum instantly calms my skin, probably because of the aloe. I don't like however that sometimes it goes on a bit foamy, which can happen with Niacinamide apparently, but it doesn't do that a lot. Also its so cheap, if you're looking to fade dark spots, Sun spots, age spots, and possibly help with existing PIE, spend the 12-15 dollars and see if you like it or not! :)",

    "body": "I vaguely remember signing up for the notification for Charlotte Cho's new launch about a month or so back and received an email about the opening of her new brand, '[Then I Met You](https://thenimetyou.com/),' this morning. While I only looked at Soko Glam during the very beginning of my skincare days, I know it's a popular outlet for a lot of people since it's a convenient, one-stop-shop for a lot of the most popular Asian beauty products. \n\nIt appears that Charlotte Cho wants to dive into the realm of making her own skincare products and the new brand touts a very similar story to a lot of other online-owned brands. Based on the 'Our Story' page, she's focusing on \"**natural, premium ingredients, even when it means cutting into our own margin.\"** (ok, sis).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe initial launch is a cleansing balm and a cleansing gel sold separately or as a pair. Here's the breakdown:\n\n* LIVING CLEANSING BALM (38.00 USD): **Massage this luxurious, sorbet-soft oil cleanser into the skin to melt away oil-based impurities, such as sunscreen, makeup and excess sebum while nourishing the skin with antioxidants, essential fatty acids and vitamin E.**\n\n>Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Trii-sostearate, PEG-8 Isostearate, Cera Microcristallina (Microcrystalline Wax/Cire Microcristalline), Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Ceresin, Synthetic Wax, Orbiignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Diospyros Kaki Fruit Extract, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Rosemarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Ethylene/Propylene Copolymer\n\n* SOOTHING TEA CLEANSING GEL (36.00 USD): **This premium gel cleanser with antioxidant and antibacterial properties uses gentle cleansing agents to clear skin of any impurities, without stripping the skin. The mandarin citrus scents are designed to awaken your senses during every use.**\n\n>Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Aqua (Water/Eau), Sorbitol, Glycerin, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Diethylhexyl, Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, 1,2 Hexanediol, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Diglycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Propylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Gluconolactone, Butylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, T-Butyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously, I haven't tried any of them yet but I probably won't be investing in these products. First, neither are fungal acne friendly unfortunately. Second, holy price point batman. They're expensive on their own and together they're 68.00 USD. Also, and this isn't a dig at Charlotte Cho, but the way some of these companies advertise their products as if they're absolutely revolutionary kind of blows my mind and is overdone. Cleansing balms and cleansing gels aren't new and there are only oh-so many ways you can reinvent the wheel. Does anyone else have any initial reactions?",

    "body": "Hello! So beplain initially caught my attention as I’ve heard the brand was made based on customer feedback in Korea. The ingredients list for these products are relatively simple so there was little worry for breakouts. It definitely did not disappoint!\n\nA little background: I live in a humid country with dehydrated, combination, acne-prone skin. My main concerns with my skin right now is CCs, calming and hydrating.\n\n-\n**Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam** ***4.5/5 MRP***\n\n*Glycerin, Mung Bean Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Lauryl Betaine, Betaine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Powder, Dextrin, Allantoin, Water, Ceramide NP, Green Tea Powder, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nCompared to all cleansers I’ve used so far, this was probably one of the best. It’s a pretty light green with a thick paste texture, and has small bits of what seems to be mung bean. In my opinion, you can smell mung bean, just slightly, but I didn’t mind it at all as it reminds me of those asian dessert places haha. The cleanser itself foams, but for me it wasn’t stripping at all. The cleanser contains lots of extracts which could be good for the skin, but honestly since it’s a wash-off product, I couldnt feel any of the benefits :”) The downside would be the price. In my country, it is sold for $12 for 80ml, which is more expensive than any other cleansers I’ve ever used :(\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Toner** ***3.5/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract (80.65%), Propanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Cellulose Gum, Disodium EDTA, Ceramide-NP, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nOkay so this was a 3.5 for me, just because of my skin type and the weather in my country. For oily-combo skin in humid weather, this toner felt slightly too moisturizing, so it felt kind of heavy for me. This would definitely be amazing for dry skin in the summer or oily skin in the winter. It’s a runny toner with a slight slip if you rub it against your hands. I could smell a bit of the chamomile as I apply it to my face but it wasn’t overpowering at all. It was soothing, but the main thing it did for my skin was honestly the moisturizing/hydrating component. If that was what you’re looking for in a runny toner, I’d definitely recommend this!\n\n-\n**Cicaful ampoule** ***4.5/5 WRP***\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract (81.44%), Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone*\n\nI understand you probably are sick with all the cica products dominating the market, but this ampoule was *really good* for me. This ampoule is clear and very viscous, almost like a gel but still relatively runny. As you rub it on your skin it becomes like water, and sinks in reaaally quick. I’ve heard people say this was hydrating for them, but it wasn’t *that* hydrating for me. The calming effect was *amazing* though—redness in my face can minimize as soon as a few hours after application. It felt cooling and very soothing to the skin. Though I would say I run out of the bottle relatively quicker than other serums haha. If you need a calming, no fuss ampoule with minimal ingredients and low breakout risk, this is definitely one to try out!\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Lotion** ***3/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Kelp Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Purified Water, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Squalane (Plant-derived), Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide-NP, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pentylene Glycol*\n\nCompared to other lotions/emulsions I’ve tried, I don’t think I prefer this one. This lotion was a bit thick and holds it’s shape better when you try making it run down. It has the chamomile smell similar to the toner, but far more minimal that you really can’t smell it unless you’re trying to. It’s very moisturizing, probably enough if you use this as a moisturizer in the summer. It spreads well and you don’t need a lot to cover your entire face, but it sinks in less quick, so after using it, it feels like you’ve put a legit cream moisturizer on your face. This was *not* a bad product, but it’s probably better geared towards those with dry skin.\n\n-\n**Hyaluronic Aqua Moisturizer** ***4/5 WRP***\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Methyl Trimethicone, Methylpropanediol, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP, Copolymer, Raffinose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate (100ppm), Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (100ppm), Allantoin, Madecassoide, Beta-glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ethylcellulose, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-51*\n\nRight off the bat, the texture surprised me. This came out as a translucent balm-like gel with no scent, like a less strong vaseline, so for those with dehydrated skin, this one is for you! I was kinda scared using it thinking it was going to be heavy, but I have been using it at night and it’s done wonders for my skin the next morning. Perhaps because my skin is dehydrated, but with this product, my skin texture really improved. As this also was not like a very emollient moisturizer, it felt like it was a layer sealing in all the serum and toner I used before and did not feel clogging at all. Honestly, this product turned out faaaaaar better than I expected!\n\n-\n\nOverall I am really impressed with the brand. None of their products broke me out, which is incredible! All in all I’d say I recommend the cleanser and the cica ampoule for all skin types, the chamomile line for dry skin types (or combo/oily in the winter) and the aqua moisturizer for dehydrated skin. I hope this review was helpful for you and have a great day!",

    "body": "Review day 2/7\nI've been a pimple patch skeptic for years and I didn't think it was a necessity to buy them (I still don't think you need them but they do help). However, the past two years I noticed that when I do break out it's huge and it takes weeks to heal which sucks. So I decided to buy 4 different brands of pimple patches to determine which ones my skin (which ranges from combo, normal and dry depending on the season) likes the best . I tested them all with the help of some of my friends that have other skin concerns(sensitive acne prone, super oily acne prone, combo dehydrated, dry acne prone, and oily dehydrated skin) \n\nBefore I do start pimple patches should be applied after cleansing when your face is dry or else it won't work well. I'll try to go in depth as possible. \n\nA’PIEU NonCo Tea Tree Spot Patch\nThis patch is thin, clear, and almost unnoticeable on the skin. I've worn these out several times and the only times people noticed was when i was facing a certain way in the light. This is a medicated acne patch. It sticks very well (i had it on my face for 4 days because I forgot I had it there and despite all of my daily activities and my cities strange weather patterns it stayed on). It just really adheres to your skin nicely and imo easy to remove off. It contains tee tree oil and salicylic. If you have a sensitivity to either of these items I'd pass. You won't see stuff come out at least for me but it reduces the size These are best used for 'normal' acne. These are just a good basic if you don't have severe acne problems. \n\nIngredients:\nAcrylates Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Water, Alcohol, Melaleuca Alternofolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Salicylic Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Allantion, Phytosphingosine, Polysorbate 80, Methylparaben\n\nOn yesstyle you can get the 8+2 pack so you get 120 patches for $7CAD RRS sells them too. Any skin type can use these. \n\n\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch\n A cult fave and the first one I tried out. These patches are made from hydrocolloid which is used in hospitals to treat wounds and prevent infections. They are around the same thickness as the mentholatum patches aka their thicker than expected but not super thick. They are a white colour so its noticeable if you walk out in it. Where this product beats the a'pieu patches is overnight your pimple will be popped and you can see the gunk clearly, it also has more protective features. It really does stay still and doesn't budge If you have oily acne prone skin I recommend this one. They also have three different sizes the third size is perfect for those tiny spots you get. These also work on non severe white heads as well as my friend found out. \n\nIngredients:\nCellulose gum, Styrene Isoprene Styrene Block Copolymer, Polysobutylene, Petroleum Resin, Polyurethane Film, Liquid Paraffin, Tetrakis Methane\n\nComes with 24 patches roughly $5 CAD on yesstyle which u think is like $\t3 something USD. Anybody acne prone skin I think may like it but anyone else can use them too. \n\nAcropass Trouble Cure\n \nThese don't just heal pimples above the skin it goes underneath and fights them too. The patches are made with little microneedles from Niacinamide and Hyaluronic acid serum. They are so tiny I can't see them at all. It has a similar pops a hole in the pimple and sends the serum deeper into the spot. The patches come with two steps. Step one is cleansing the area with a cotton swab filled with tea treatments and salicylic acid. Step two is the serum. Apparently its meant for all types of acne according to soko glam. They are super thick night time use only and don't leave on for more than 8 hours since it started to sting after that. Really good for people suffering with serious acne concern it is very pricey so it's down on my list. \n\nIngredients:\nStep 1 \n\nEthanol, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf oil, Salicyc Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nStep 2\n\nHydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Oligopeptide-76, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThe box comes enough with only 6 uses and it's $18 USD on Soko Glam so I don't think it's worth it my friend that suffers from cyst and hormonal acne loves it and will continue to splurge on it. It's also good if you have dry skin with break outs. \n\n \nMentholatum Acnes Acne Patch \n\nThey are medicated time so it helps stop the growth of the bacteria while healing it at the same time. These patches are amazing for cyst and prevents your cyst becoming infected. They are kind of thick and are kinda opaque so it's noticeable when you wear them. Also if you have oily skin just to warn you they move around a bit but on dry skin it stays on better than the cosrx. Mine came with this little tweezer applicator so that's a plus if sanitation is big for you. Gave it to my younger sister a few days before her prom and she had to constantly put new ones on since it would just slide off her skin. Some people prefer this one but it was just meh imo. \n\n36 pieces for $8CAD if you're prone to cist and have combo, normal or dry skin this should work. \n\nHope this was a little helpful! \n",

I also find that they're the most thin and discreet patches that I've come across as well. I've used both the ones in the green box and blue box. I think the only difference between the two may just be the size. The green has two different sizes whereas the blue has just the small size. I think the thickness is the same but I'm not 100% certain on that. I did recently purchase the Cosrx invisible ones (black label) but I haven't gotten round to testing them out to see if they're better than the Mentolatum ones. I've also used Nexcare before and I hate them. They're super thick, not discreet at all and have almost zero sticking power that it's frustrating.

    "body": "[Manyo Factory Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Repair Skin Toner](http://manyo-factory.com/en/shop/product/hyaluronic-acid-hydrating-repair-skin-toner)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI purchased this toner about a month ago. I know only a month's use is a bit premature, and I usually do reviews of products once I have completely finished them,  but if I wait until I finish this product it will probably be 5-6 months from now.\n\n**Feel**\n\nThis toner feels really nice on the skin. It is a bit thicker than water and is totally clear. I pour a small puddle into my hand, and then pat into my skin. I apply it after using a facial spray (Caudalie Grape Water or Manyo Factory Lactobacillus Mist). I bring it up under my eyes without irritation. I even apply it to my lips.\n\n**Results**\n\nSo for skin care products that aren't actives, I sometimes feel like I don't notice any difference in my skin, and I have to wonder if it's doing anything at all. I was beginning to feel the same way about this product, but then I forgot to apply it the other day before going to work, and my skin had a slight tight feeling all day. I was definitely missing some hydration. This toner definitely hydrates my skin well, and when applied to my lips makes them plumper. I really enjoy using this, and I might even like it better than the Pyunkang Yul Essence toner that I always recommend to people looking for a hydrating toner.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nI'll include the entire ingredients list so you can see all the awesome stuff in it. I was really impressed with the ingredients list.\n\n Mineral Water, Carbonated Water, Hydrolyzed Collagen Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Sodium PCA, Urea, Uric Acid, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Magnesium Chloride, Ceramide NP, Oligopeptide-29, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Arbutin, Butylene Glycol, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Water, Methylpropanediol, Chondrus Crispus Powder, Caprylyl Glycol, Glutamic acid, Threonine, Serine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Lactic acid, Citric Acid, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Valine, Isoleucine,Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Cysteine, Xanthan Gum, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Aspartic acid \n\nYou've got ceramides, collagen, glycerin, arbutin, allantoin, urea, panthenol, amino acids, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, and plant extracts. It's a win in my book. I would bet this could help repair a damaged moisture barrier (the name says as much anyway)\n\n**Packaging**\n\nIt comes in a 250 mL bottle with a flip cap. I haven't experienced any issues with pouring out too much. I think the packaging is great, and would probably be good for traveling (obviously not on an airplane because it's too big for the liquid regulations)\n\n**Repurchase?**\n\nAbsolutely! My mom is using it too, and we both love it. It definitely makes a difference in my skin and leaves it feeling hydrated. I would recommend this to anyone needing a hydrating toner. It also layers well if you wanted to do the 7 skin method with it. I haven't done 7 layers, but have done 2 or 3 without issue. It also works well when I use it alongside the Pyunkang Yul Essence toner.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

Long review for a toner with a long name.  ](https://preview.redd.it/7z31ebpe0xp11.jpg?width=3120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51291a489379e7905d9af56cb96020811c461191)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Natto Gum, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 2, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 5, Ceramide 6 II, Inositol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Allantoin, Trehalose, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate\n\nPrice: $13-$14 for a 4oz glass bottle or $8-$9 for a refill packet from amazon.jp \n\nMy skin type: dry, acne prone, hella sensitive with texture issues. \n\nMy current routine:\n\n(AM) 3 layers of this toner, Etude House Soon Jung Emulsion mixed with Stratia Liquid Gold, Black Girl Sunscreen\n\n(PM) Cleanse, 7 layers of this toner, Etude House Soon Jung Barrier Intensive Cream mixed with Stratia Liquid Gold -- On Sundays, I apply Stratia Soft Touch before toner and one Wednesdays if my skin is particularly clogged I'll use The Ordinary's Salicylic Acid %2 all over. If not I just spot treat on that day when necessary. \n\nI also only started mixing Liquid Gold in with my moisturizers this week since I've been patch testing off and on for a while.\n\nReview: \n\nAlright, so I had this entire review typed up and I don't know what the hell happened to it so I'm going to try and make this one better lol. \n\nFirst, let's talk about the packaging and the price. For $13 you 4 fl ounces of toner in a frosted glass bottle that looks elegant af. I feel so bougie just holding it. The glass is a little thick so the bottle has some weight to it so that's just additional points on the bougie scale. \n\nThe toner itself has a pretty damn sweet ingredients list if I do say so myself. Short and filled with a bunch of stuff my skin has just been loving. It has five different types of ceramides (not the golden ration but tbh I didn't need it to be), rice bran extract, allantoin (which is healing af), sodium hyaluronate and different forms of soybean which overall make this hella nourishing. It's fragrance-free and from the description on the brands website, geared towards sensitive oily skin (I think any skin type could potentially benefit from it but as always ymmv)\n\nI've been using it for about a month and a half and initially didn’t think it was doing anything for me. At the time I was struggling with irritation because my skin suddenly started hating Cerave products which caused my wallet and I to cry. This is what my routine was looking like at that time.\n\n(AM) iUnik Hyaluronic Acid toner (1 layer), Etude House Soon Jung Emulsion, Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion, Biore Rich Watery Essence\n\n(PM) Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, Etude House Soon Jung toner, iUnik Hyaluronic Acid toner, Etude House Barrier Intensive Cream, Egyptian Magic Balm\n\nAfter I dropped both Cerave products (and the Biore sunscreen) and finished patch testing this, I put it in place of my Etude House toner (which is now a mist). My iUnik toner was overshadowing this toner for about a week or two (and stinging my face ever so slightly) so I gave up on it and decided to use the other half of the bottle on my body. Once I did that, it made it easier for this toner to really show through. \n\nThis toner is watery and doesn't take long to sink into my skin but it doesn't just disappear afterwards either. Whether it be three layers or seven, my skin is still left with this glow to it and feels super soft and moisturized. Any tightness it gone and I experience no stinging whatsoever which is shocking since even my most gentle products would sting any areas that Cerave had irritated even weeks after cutting out Cerave. The moisture lasts a long time too. I can go off and do something mid routine and come back an hour later and my skin is still moisturized with just the toner. \n\nWhat solidified this product into HG status for me was how it's helped my skin these past two weeks. I've been using Stratia Soft Touch once a week for a while and wanted to test out moving my usage up to twice a week, once on Sundays and then on Wednesdays. Well I didn't experience any irritation afterwards so it seemed like my skin responded well…… until the next day. After coming home from work that evening I noticed my skin was really flaky, like I could lightly rub my face and see little flakes appearing everywhere. I wasn't sure if this was a normal thing or not so I waited two days, keeping my routine the same minus any actives of course. The flaking seemed to get a bit worse and the area around my nose was the flakiest so I decided my best bet would probably be to layer the toner more in both routine and stick to the EH SJ cream instead of the emulsion for the time being. \n\nBefore a week had gone by, my skin had turned around quite a lot and I know the toner played a huge part in it since the Etude House doesn't do much on its own. It's purpose is to be a clean, simple sensitive-friendly moisturizer and it does that perfectly well. It just hasn't had the healing power on its own against the issues I'd been dealing with with my skin lately. \n\nAnyways, in the long run, after using this toner my skin seems to have normalized. It doesn't require heavy products to maintain its moisture and it's soft as a babys skin all over. My textural issues are pretty much gone and I know that Stratia Soft Touch has definitely been helping a lot with that. My skin has a nice glow now and looks and feels healthy. I haven't ever been this pleased with a toner and knowing that it's only less than $10 to buy a refill pretty much guarantees that I won't be buying another toner. I get everything I needed and more from this and I couldn't be happier. \n\nI am curious about the Rich version of this toner though but I'll wait and see how this light version does in the winter time before I consider buying another toner. \n\nIf there's anything else you wanna know when it comes to my experiences and thoughts let me know. I don't review stuff often so I'm bound to have missed some things. I just knew that when I was looking up this product there weren't many reviews and I wanted to make sure that if someone else was interested in this product there was at least one more review out there for them to read.

I introduced it after the unscented Klairs Supple Prep toner completely wrecked my skin after a few uses - my face was painfully irritated, dry and flaky with red patches and my trusted bland products either stung (TO NMF) or didn't really help (squalane). This toner fixed all that in a matter of days, I couldn't believe it! I agree with everything in your review and also think it will become a HG for me, unless I like the Rich version even better (I have a sample to test out). It layers easily and is just an all-around pleasure to use. I highly recommend this to anyone whose skin is too sensitive for other toners out there!\n\nEdited to add: OP, having tried both the Matsuyama and Soon Jung toners, are you still gonna repurchase the Soon Jung to use as a mist or do you think it's redundant? I'm really interested in the whole Soon Jung line and have been wondering whether there's still a point in trying out the toner.",

    "body": "Hey guys. After 4 years of searching for a good moisturizer in Germany, that have non-irritating and great ingredients, does not cause Fungal acne or aggravate it, which costs less than 10 EURO, I have found 3 moisturizers that I love and would recommend to you all! Note: I have combination to oily and acne prone skin.\n\n1. **CeraVe Feuchtigkeitscreme für trockene bis sehr trockene Haut (50 ml - 2,99 EURO*)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tq5pjfqnr8n41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1c337d05b4e30f31540271070f2887865f4ab99\n\nI know, I know. This is for dry skin. BUT. I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE. This is the second cheapest compared to the other two. The texture is creamy but it absorbs really fast into the skin. At first I am skeptical too to try this moisturizer. But but but, OMG. I think I have found my holy grail of moisturizer. Haha. It does not contains any fragrances, non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic, helps in restoring the skin barrier, contains ceramides and also hyaluronic acid. This moisturizer makes my skin very supple and does not sting even once! Even near my nose that are very sensitive! I would 100% recommend this moisturizer! I use this moisturizer for PM routine to lock the serums that I used. This product surprisingly does not leave your skin sticky! You can buy this at a pharmacy or even online pharmacy :)\n\n\n2.  **ISANA MED Hydro Feuchtigkeitscreme (50 ml - 2,49 EURO)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqwtdylpr8n41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7df7144ba2f6cbc49e2cb76af88dacc11fea488a\n\nOMG, this moisturizer. I use this product for AM routine. It removes excess oil and leaves your skin very hydrated. The pH value is 5,5 (nice). Contains hyaluronic acid and Betain, plus the ingredients listed are minimal, not too complicated. The fragrance might be the downside of this product, it smells kinda weird. BUT so far it does not irritate my skin, my skin is loving this product. The texture is translucent, and is easy to spread on your face, kinda like a gel. It leaves the skin a matt finishing when it dries, and its not sticky. Plus your skin wont feel tight. Its the cheapest of all three, and I would recommend to those that have dehydrated skin. Be sure to apply them on a wet face though so that it can lock the moisture. I always spray a good amount of BALEA MED ULTRA SENSITiVE GESICHTSWASSER on my skin before applying any moisturizer. You can buy it in Rossmann, where they put their brands such as Sebamed, Salthouse and other medical care related products. \n\n**3. Sebamed Unreine Haut Pflege Gel (50 ml - 6,49 EURO)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kxluoj2rr8n41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4f375281a674453dc8c174cfbd08eb1afd64cd4\n\nThis was my holy grail back then when I first discovered that I had fungal acne. This saved my skin. It has a clear gel texture and contains some good ingredients like pathenol, allantoin and sodium hyaluronate. Does not have fragrances which is good for sensitive skin. I stopped using this moisturizer because I discovered the two above, and this product leaves my skin tight and shiny (not because of oiliness but the tightness). I would recommend this to people that have oily skin. I'm not sure about you lot, I know that Sebamed sells their product in both Rossmann and DM, but this Pflege Gel is only available in Müller in my city.\n\nLeave a comment down below and tell me your holy grail moisturizer + where you are from!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Price of Cerave Moisturizer might be vary depending on pharmacy.\n\nEDIT: added the pictures for the three mentioned moisturizers\n\nEDIT: Where to buy them",

    "body": "hello! i've been deep in the world of asian skincare for a month now, and i thought i'd share my products and findings so far!\n\n**Source of products**: *1st picture* is a combination of products from unblemish and beauty bay. everything except the BoJ balm and cream on the far left are from unblemish, as well as the freebies in the bottom right corner! i'd fully recommend that site, it also has the best prices in the UK mainland from my findings. \n\n*2nd picture* are from TK Maxx, and the *3rd picture* is a bonus of how i store the products in a carry case i got from b&m bargains for £5 lmao\n\n**Me**: i'm 25, living in the UK so our climate is very mixed. when it's hot it's humid as hell, and when it's cold it's bitter. my skin however, remains oily! i am also very acne-prone, particularly on my cheeks. i think the cause of this is largely hormonal; i'm limited when it comes to birth control due to migraines, and also flat-out refuse to change my current birth control, and i cannot afford a private dermatologist, nor is it worth battling with GPs for derm care here. i've tried it, not worth it. i'd been prescribed a benzoyl peroxide & clindamycin cream before and it did a great job at getting rid of my spots and any nourishment and niceness in my skin, as well as destroyed my towels. the acne just came back when i stopped it too.\n\nmy aim is to manage my skin with skincare products - if i nourish it and treat it well, then hopefully i will have less problems. so far, one month in, i've had a small hormonal breakout, but otherwise my spots are under control, and my general skin condition is better than ever. the spots i get either never come to a head and disappear after a couple days, or are just little whiteheads. i no longer get painful, swollen welts on my skin like i used to. \n\nmore things: i am a picker. this is a habit i have drastically cut down on, but i need to eliminate it. i also don't wear foundation/complexion? makeup, only eye makeup & eyebrows, so i cannot comment on how any of these products work or look under foundation.\n\nother things i knew about my skin going into this is that it loves niacinamide, and it loves centella. so those are two ingredients i looked for in products. my skin isn't overly sensitive and it does generally tolerate most things\n\n**my routine**: you can probably see, i love a long routine. it makes my brain happy, i just enjoy applying everything. i do leave time between essence & serums, and serums & moisturisers. the AHA/BHA toner gets used 3 times a week, and the wash-off pack twice a week. i also planned to use non-AB 10% azelaic acid twice a week but the one i have brought i fuckin' hate so none of that for now. i double cleanse morning and night, cause... i like it and it controls my oil. i do NOT currently have a sunscreen which is super super bad, but i had to research a lot to find one i would likely like, and currently in the UK we don't have much sun or UV to speak of, plus i don't work, nor do i rarely go, outside. i have sunscreen on the way now!\n\nif not otherwise mentioned, all products used are AB and in these photos!\n\n*AM*\n- double cleanse, wash off with cold water\n- toner\n- non-AB 10% niacinamide serum\n- moisturiser\n\n*PM*\n- double cleanse, wash off with cold water\n- wash off pack if wash off pack night\n- toner\n- AHA/BHA here if AHA/BHA night\n- essence\n- serums. sometimes i layer, sometimes i don't\n- moisturiser\n\ni think that's everything... products and reviews incoming!\n\n**bold is the name of the products**\n*italics are the ingredients that stood out to me*\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Radiance Cleansing Balm**\n*ferments, rice extracts*\nfeels so luxurious to use each and every time, both packaging and product-wise. it's so nice to massage into my skin, and it collects and removes any dry flakes and general grit/dirt without being stripping. it also removes all my eye makeup and brows, including waterproof mascara, with little effort! i sometimes end up with a blurry eye for a minute or so after washing it off but given that it's not everytime i use it, i think the fault is in my technique rather than the product itself. leaves my skin feeling both clean and soft and like it's been 'conditioned'. i don't feel the need or even want to try any more oil/balm/first-step cleansers as this is so perfect for me, even if it's a bit pricey for how quick i get through it (1 month in and i'm just over halfway through my pot). HG and have already repurchased, 5/5\n\n**haruharu wonder - Unscented Black Rice Moisture 5.5 Soft Cleansing Gel**\n*ferments, rice extracts, ginseng, beta glucan*\nanother absolutely lovely product, in a similar vein to the radiance balm with the ferments and nice clean but non-stripping feel. foams up well but i do give it a good long massage onto my face so sometimes i dash a little extra water onto my face to keep it foamy. it's unscented but does still have a smell - just a clean skincare product smell, which i imagine is the surfactants, so it's very very subtle and inoffensive. would be another instant repurchase except unblemish was out of stock and stylevana wouldn't have it in stock for 30! days so i ordered a couple of different 2nd step cleansers to try. so still a HG, the only problem here is my own inpatience (and like, a need for some sort of cleanser for when this runs out) 5/5\n\nnote on the cleansers: i really think with the research i did and general luck that i ended up with a great combination of cleansers here. i think the ferments do play a good part in conditioning my skin, i was worried that they'd leave me with a negative reaction as they don't appear to work well for everyone but i'm glad i took the risk!\n\n**SKIN1004 - Madagascar Centella Poremizing Clear Toner**\n*centella, 'pink himalayan' salt, panthenol, 3x hyaluronic acids, salicylic acid, glycolic acid*\na semi-confusing one for me. it's a very good spot treatment - i have a horrible habit of picking spots when i get anxious, and if i hold a cotton pad with this toner on on top of the popped/squeezed spot, by the next morning the actual spot is gone and dried up and only little scabs and redness remain. but as a full face toner, it's just not hydrating enough, even with my oily skin, and honestly it's a bit stripping because i do use a LOT of toner (my bottle is almost empty after a month). looking at the ingredients and description it seems to want to do everything all at once, which is a tough goal to set yourself when you're only a toner. i also don't enjoy salt as a 'star' ingredient, i believe that's what leads to the stripping feeling, and it's a shame because there's SO many nice ingredients at lesser volumes than the salt in this and i feel like they don't stand a chance of working. i've brought some other toners to try, however i might repurchase this as i've never used anything so effective at nerfing a spot. MRP, 3.5/5\n\n**Dr. Ceuracle - Vegan Kombucha Tea Essence**\n*ferments, green tea, centella*\nso i went through a patch this month where the skin around my eyes was SO dry and sensitive, and this was the only thing that calmed it down and didn't sting. it feels like it calms my skin down almost instantly, especially in inflamed patches around spots. it's very rich, in both product and packaging, and the smallest amount goes a very long way. i've barely even made a dent in my bottle, but then i can only use it at night. why? it leaves a 'film' on my skin, like it's never truly soaked in, and this is something my oily self definitely does not need in the mornings. this is such a shame as everything else about it is so nice, and i wonder if maybe it's just not the best product for someone with oily skin. there isn't anything that controls oil in it, after all. it's also expensive LMAO but it's going to last me a ridiculous amount of time so it kind of evens out. MRP, 4/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Glow Serum**\n*propolis, niacinamide, centella, tea tree, betaine salicylate*\ni was expecting to love this one as it has niacinamide, but the main ingredient here is the 60% propolis and the niacinamide is formulated at only 2%. i use and reap the benefits of using a stronger niacinamide serum in the morning, and i enjoy a 2% boost in the evening, but the main component propolis here just does nothing for me. there's also 0.5% betaine salicylate which is a nice bonus but just isn't enough for an effect on my pores. the texture is fine, it's nice and i'll finish it, but i wouldn't repurchase as the main ingredient just doesn't seem to work or do anything for me WNRP, 2.5/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Revive Serum**\n*ginseng, snail mucin, niacinamide, licorice, 3x hyaluronic acids*\nmy first introduction to snail, it's only in a small amount here (3%) but i wanted to make sure my skin didn't react badly to snail before i went a brought a high% snail treatment. and it doesn't! my skin absolutely loved this serum and it's made me want to look at not on snail, but ginseng as well as main ingredients in my routine. it made my skin feel moist without being... oily lmao, and i also noticed texture improvements around my spots/scars/pores on my cheeks where my skin texture is the worst. It's also very non-sticky and thin and soaks in well! MRP but i'm going to buy seperate snail and ginseng products to try them more in depth first, 5/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Calming Serum**\n*green tea, mugwort, panthenol, centella, sodium hyaluronate*\ni've only used this a few times when my skin has been particularly angry, and it does what it says on the tin - overall calms inflammation and takes any sting out. i do need to use it more before i can post a conclusion and rating for it though! \n\n**Beauty of Joseon** - Glow Deep Serum**\n*rice extracts, alpha-arbutin, niacinamide, panthenol*\nhave not used this one yet! more rice extracts though which seem to work lovely on my skin, so i'm hopeful!\n\n**AXIS-Y - Dark Spot Correcting Serum**\n*niacinamide, squalane^, sodium hyaluronate, rice extracts, sea buckthorn*\nit doesn't do anything for me, atall, and something in it doesn't agree with my skin as i found that when i put it on my patches of acne, it not only didn't bring down an inflammation, but it brought up CCs around those areas. 5% niacinamide is not enough for me when my skin laps up and loves 10% on the daily. i applied this to areas where i have light scarring, dark spots etc. as well as patches where i had a spot developing and patches where spots were 'going away' and it did absolutely 0. glad i just brought the mini, WNRP 0/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Red Bean Water Gel**\n*red bean extracts, panthenol, beta glucan, 3x peptides*\nthis is really, really good at controlling sebum/oil throughout the day, and i can get very oily. it is a gel texture and doesn't feel like a moisturiser which i have mixed opinions about - like, i know it's a gel and not a cream, but i want my moisturiser to feel moisturising if that makes sense. i don't feel that it /adds/ any benefit to my skin, the benefit is in the oil control itself. definitely a gel for oily people and not those who are dry, 100%. i think it's great as a standalone moisturiser in my morning routine, but for my night routine i do want to add (and have ordered) a more hydrating and enriching (but NOT TOO RICH) cream. MRP, 4.5/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Dynasty Cream**\n*rice extracts, ginseng, niacinamide, squalane^, 3x hyaluronic acids*\nthis is a beautiful product but i'm not sure what tree i was barking up when i thought it was remotely for me and my skin. this is thick, rich and super hydrating and it's way way too much for my oily skin. it sits on my skin and in my pores - truthfully, if i look at my nose an hour or two after using this i can actually see the oil sitting in my pores - and it just doesn't seem to soak in all the way. i think it also worsened the spots on my cheeks when i used it, much like the axis-y serum. lovely around my eyes though and i have been putting the tiniest amount under them when the skin is sore and dry, and it actually cleared up the dry/red/damaged skin i had in the very far corners of my eyes in a couple of days, which is a testament to it not being a bad product, just the wrong product for me and my skin type. i'm never going to get through the pot if i use it as an eye cream though so i'm going to pass it on to my mum who will probably benefit from it. WNRP, 1/5 for my skin (type), not bad just not for me\n\n^ i'll be avoiding squalane in skincare for the foreseeable. process of deduction, it seems to be something that does not agree with my skin, especially acne/spot wise.\n\n2nd picture!\n**COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner**\n*glycolic acid, betaine salicylate, panthenol*\nthis was something on my list-to-by, even at full price. i've tried one AHA/BHA product before, the non-AB infamous 30% AHA 2% BHA peeling solution, and hated it because it just stung like crap and did nothing for my skin - now after researching, i know why! with oily, acne-prone skin i knew it was worth giving a more mild AHA/BHA product a go, and this came up as top choice. i love it, i use it 3x a week and even then it's already making a big difference. the first time i used it it seemed to make the pores on my forehead vanish, i've never looked so so smooth!! i really think this is helping to prevent my breakouts at the moment, even on my cheeks which are my main problem areas. it smells like it has alcohol in it which freaked me out a bit at first, but double-checking the ingredients, it doesn't! WRP 5/5, but might also look at different AB AHA/BHA products too\n\n**Mary & May Niacinamide + Chaenomeles Sinesis Serum**\n*chaenomeles sinesis (chinese quince), niacinamide*\nhaven't tried this yet, so no rating! i brought it to replace my non-AB morning 10% niacinmide before i realised it's only 2% niacinamide. i should read things before i buy them, but still it sounds like a great serum and i'll cycle it into my night routine at some point. it was £7, which is a bargain.\n\n**Mary & May CICA Tea Tree Soothing Wash Off Pack**\n*centella, tea tree, calamine*\nclay masks scare me - all of the western ones i've tried are stripping and drying as all hell. i saw this reduced at £6 and saw the centella in it and thought that if any clay mask is for me, it would be one like this. it is really, really nice, it has a fresh smell from the tea tree, it spreads on nicely and dries pretty quickly, and most importantly when i wash it off, i don't feel like i've sucked all of the moisture out of my skin. i'm only using it twice a week, not on AHA/BHA nights, and would probably not use it much more than that, but it's a nice way to get a boost of my much loved centella in my routine whilst still being a really good antidote for all of my oil and blocked pores with the tea tree. MRP if i find for a great price again, it's just not something i NEED in my routine, but it is a nice extra! also i want to try M&Ms other wash off packs lmao 4/5",

    "body": "Sharing my post here as well. Recently, I had posted requesting dupes for Bite's Agave Lip Mask as it is now being discontinued. This stuff is ride or die lip salvation for me. I live somewhere super dry, work in a dry environment, take meds that dry me out, you get the picture. I'm a moisture junkie. I gathered the piece that works is the lanolin in it so I tried some similar products and wrote some reviews of them.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It also got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. It's good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. It's a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. It's a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, it's going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!",

I usually have to warm a little of the product on my finger before applying it because it is so thick. It has a very slightly minty scent and a slight cooling sensation on application. It comes in a small tin, and one tin lasts me approximately a year of twice daily use. I also work in a hospital environment, and this is the only balm that has ever adequately protected my lips from the dry hospital air. It’s also currently $10 (half off) on their website. Thanks to you, I looked it up so I could post the ingredients and saw the sale so I’ll probably stock up on a little more!\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Cera Alba (Beeswax, Cire d'abeille), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Water/Aqua/Eau, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Aroma (Flavor), Urea, Mel (Honey, Miel), Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hydroxide, EDTA, Eugenol.",

Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum. It was clear when it arrived but has turned slightly yellow now.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Took a picture of the vitamin C serum. It turned slightly yellow now. It was clear when it arrived.](https://preview.redd.it/a5ikili8bjg51.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd81bcb46e515122c37d2f0c79d1440712e1a2f0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **COPPER TRIPEPTIDE + PHYTO CERAMIDE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phospholipids (and Sphingolipids, Copper tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.))\n\n***My experience:*** I wanted to include copper-peptides in my routine after Gothamista raved about them. I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

It seems like most of them aren’t even hiring proper chemists and cosmetic formulators but rather reading up on what’s popular abroad and DIYing in their kitchen because they believe the Indian consumer isn’t educated enough to check PH. so thanks for doing that. Also if one batches PH went wrong I hope they weren’t being cheap and informed the other people who purchased from that batch and refunded them. Or else they’re literally endangering those customers skin",

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nThis post doesn't include treatment, which I think has been covered pretty well. r/FungalAcne will teach you everything you need to know! This [beautiful breakdown of the entire skin condition](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/), by the amazing f.c., covers most everything. \n\nAlso of interest might be [my post on how to use anti-fungal or anti-dandruff shampoos effectively.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibxm82/how_to_use_dandruff_fungal_acne_treatments/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\nIf you want to check a particular product yourself, copy the ingredients list and paste it into a dedicated search engine like [Sezia](https://www.sezia.co/) or [Folliculitis Scout](https://folliculitisscout.com/). I use Sezia ☺\n\nThe challenge after treating malassezia is... what else to use? Maybe your active fungal acne is gone, but it comes back if you use your usual products. It's hard to find fungal safe products in India, and this is what I worked out for myself. IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, SO YOU CAN'T SUE ME LATER, OKAY? K, thanx 😂❤ These are products I have personally used, that worked for me. \n\nYou don't have to have fungal acne to use them, of course, but they won't contribute to the growth of Malassezia or \"normal\" acne☺ \n\n#Cleansers\n\n+ **Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water** *₹175 for 125 ml* the PINK one, for sensitive skin. I use this to remove makeup or sunscreen, ~~with reusable cotton pads I got off Amazon~~ in a foaming pump bottle, using the foam on dry skin. It works, is fungal safe, and isn't as time consuming as oil cleansing. 5/5\n\n\n+ **Amazon Brand - Solimo Micellar Water** *₹87 for 200 ml* - I had to recheck that price, but nope. That's how much it currently costs on Amazon 😧 I think the price does vary on the website, but it's always cheaper than the Garnier micellar water, and works exactly the same, far as I can see 😆 5/5\n\n\n+ **Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash** *₹60 for 50 ml* . Has glycerin as second ingredient, I think. A very nice, basic gel that doesn't foam much and is fungal safe. 4/5\n\n+ **Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash** *₹450 for 200 ml* great as an introduction to chemical exfoliation! I use it at night, less these days because of tretinoin. The ingredients are gentle enough that I can leave it on for ten minutes, as a mild treatment. Pricey, but the bottle lasts me at least six months. 5/5\n\n\n+ **Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash** *₹350 for 100ml* available for less than 300, usually. This has been my nightly cleanser (built up to daily use), and how I use a BHA, because BHA serums don't seem to do anything for me 😂 It's a very nice, non-stripping cleanser that doesn't foam a lot... it's lasted me over *six months* and still isn't over 😦 5/5\n\n\n+ **Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E** *₹190 for 200 ml*. I use this to oil cleanse once a week, or when I feel like my pores are especially clogged. I spend at least fifteen minutes massaging it in till it's warm and melts the sebaceous clogs, then use warm water and a microfiber cloth to remove most of it, massaging in between putting the warm towel on my face, to \"steam\" it. Works great. \n\nWould NOT recommend doing this daily, as the heat and occlusion can worsen fungal acne, and that much massage is way too long and will irritate fungal acne, \"normal\" acne, or sensitive skin. It's a deep cleanse. Followed up with a face wash. \n\nUPDATE: I now oil cleanse using:\n\n+ **Luxura Sciences MCT Oil** *₹399 for 250ml* - switched to using this instead of Baby Oil because it's lighter, fungal-safe, and can be adequately washed off with face wash, which allows me to avoid the potential dehydration and irritation of hot towels ☺ I use this to remove makeup, as well, with minimal massage... I used to use my [DIY emulsifying oil cleanser](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/pq7szk/how_to_make_a_diy_emulsifying_cleansing_oil/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), but the emulsifiers are not fungal-safe, and it recently worsened a malassezia breakout I just had 🙃 I suggest you stick to plain baby oil or MCT if your malassezia is active. \n\n\n#Treatments/actives\n\n\n+ **Aziderm Gel** (AZELAIC ACID) *₹260 for 15 gms* (I have used both the 15% and 20%, pretty interchangeably, because my skin was already irritated from fungal acne, and there was not much difference between the effect of the two. I've used it with success as a treatment for fungal acne, \"normal\" acne, redness, and hyperpigmentation. If you have brown skin with any of these concerns, and want to use an active for the first time, I RECOMMEND AZELAIC ACID. It actually soothes skin, as opposed to irritating it! It does mattify the skin. This is a prescription product. (But apparently products containing 10% are available online, and don't need a prescription.) 5/5\n\n\n+ **Recast Aqua Radiance Deep Cleansing Gel** *₹450 for 200 ml*. This is a Korean-style peeling gel, or \"gommage\" type exfoliant, that also has AHAs in it, so you get a really good chemical exfoliation plus a very gentle physical exfoliation. It does tingle a tiny bit on my skin, but I'm using tretinoin regularly, so it may not do that to you. I use it maybe once every two weeks because of tretinoin, but I'd recommend it as a weekly, or twice weekly chemical exfoliation for most people! 4/5 \n\nUPDATE: I no longer use this... not because there's anything wrong with it, I just find that my cleansers with actives give me enough exfoliation, and I like doing DIY face packs instead of massaging now - my sensitive skin prefers less friction ☺\n\n+ **Minimalist Niacinamide 5% + Hyaluronic Acid 1%** *₹599 for 30ml*. Good for barrier repair and hydration, since malassezia, and the treatments for it, can be dehydrating and cause impaired barrier function. Be sure to use on a damp face, and finish with a moisturiser on top, even if it's only aloe gel. I've used a bottle of this up, and would recommend for anyone with FA wanting simple hydration and support for skin health. Less finicky than making your own mist and stuff 😂 5/5\n\n\n#Capyrlic Triglycerides, or C8 Oil\nis the isolated part of coconut oil that is antifungal! You'll see it in ingredients lists pf creams and moisturizers a lot, listed as \"capric/caprylic triglycerides\", which are C10 and C8 respectively (the number of carbon atoms.. It's chemistry... not important 😂). I have used:\n\n\n+ **NUM NUM Superfoods Pure C8 Oil** *₹400 for 100 ml*. I'm probably going to keep using this indefinitely, even if I don't get fungal cane, because it's light and my skin likes it. 5/5. When I had active fungal acne, I used to use just two drops of this on a wet face and nothing else, before sunscreen in the morning. It is a really effective treatment + \"moisturiser\", but using too much will defeat the purpose, because it will insulate and heat up your skin, which will cause fungal acne to grow. Use sparingly! \n\n#Moisturiser\n\nEDIT: This section is outdated 😂 There's a few moisturisers available now that are fungal-safe, you don't *have* to mix and layer like I did! 😆🙏🏽 Listed at the end of the post. \n\n+ **Rahul Phate's lnnovations : Hydra-smooth Hydrating Gel** *₹555 for 100gms* (contains urea!!!) : [here's the detailed review](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/prsssq/review_of_rahul_phates_hydrasmooth_hydrating_gel/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). This is currently what I would recommend to anyone with FA. It's been perfect for me so far ☺🙏🏽 5/5. Downside is, it's not vegan 😅\n\n+ The safest bet is aloe Gel, but not all are fungal safe! The two I have used and that have done good are the:\n\n1. **Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel** *₹299 for 200 ml* (Really soothing and actually makes a difference to redness or irritation!) 5/5, and \n\n2. **WOW Aloe Vera Multipurpose Beauty Gel** *₹245 for 150ml* (Less effective than the Body Cupid one, but works fine) 4/5. Gels contain XANTHAN GUM, which is a plant-derived thickener and film-forming agent. The film it leaves over your skin is usually enough for oily skin in summer. \n\n+ UREA + LACTIC ACID cream. **Remoiz** or **Moisturex** *₹220 for 100 gms* 5/5, but depends on your using it wisely! It's 10% urea, 10% lactic acid in a paraffin base. When I had fungal acne and wanted more moisture than just aloe gel, I mixed a SMALL dab of this, and three drops C8 oil, into the aloe gel at night, as both a very mild exfoliating moisturizer and a treatment for the fungal acne. You don't have to mix in the oil, because the urea cream's paraffin is occlusive enough, but I liked the resulting texture 😂 Otherwise, I do use this cream straight on my feet, knees, elbows, butt.. Anywhere the skin is thicker. \n\nUsing it neat on the face may break you out - not necessarily because of overexfoliating (as I previously thought), but simply because the paraffin base is quite heavy. Urea is a keratolytic when it's *over* 10%, so in Moisturex it's not exfoliating - the 10% lactic acid is, though! Urea has many benefits to the skin barrier, thickness and resilience, as detailed in [this SimpleSkincareScience blog post. ](https://simpleskincarescience.com/urea-for-skin/) \n\n#Oils/occlusives\n\n+ **Squalane Oil** The price of squalane varies depending on the brand. Whether it's derived from olives or sugarcane [seems to make a difference in whether or not it is fungal safe](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/#Olive_vs_Sugarcane_Squalane_Which_Is_Better_Are_Both_Safe_for_Fungal_Acne), but most people seem to be able to use either, without triggering an FA breakout. I used squalane for a while before realizing I had FA, and enjoyed using it a lot, because of how silky it is, and how well it sinks into the skin. I now prefer C8 oil, because it's like doing an ongoing maintenance treatment on the daily ☺ But if you have an FA safe routine that works for you, squalane can make a nice addition as a soothing face oil... It's a great oil for all skin types! \n\nIf you have DRY sensitive skin, with barrier damage *and* FA, I highly recommend squalane oil. If you want details, check out this amazing post: [Why Squalane Oil Is the Best Oil According to 40 Studies](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/). TLDR, it's very light and non greasy, will not feed the fungus, and is a great emollient and occlusive ☺\n\n+ **Luxura Sciences MCT Oil** *₹399 for 250ml* Purchased this after the C8 oil became unavailable. Works much the same as the C8 oil, but seems a tiny bit heavier (could be imagining it 😂). Doesn't break me out ☺ \n\n+ **Boroline Night Repair Cream** technically, it's a balm, not a cream. No water. (affordable, found at most chemists. Contains lanolin as the second last ingredient, but doesn't trigger my own FA. It's not clear if lanolin is fungal acne safe, some even say it's antifungal. I can only say that, for me, the small amount in Boroline hasn't triggered my FA). Boroline night cream has the same ingredients as plain Boroline, it's just smoother and more cosmetically elegant. I use them interchangeably. \n\nBoroline has been LOVELY to offset tretinoin-induced dryness and irritation, since it also contains soothing zinc oxide, mineral oil, and paraffin wax. May be too occlusive for use in summer, but using a tiny amount at night might work for you. I think it's great that there's an occlusive OPTION for those with FA, because barrier function is really compromised by fungal infections, and using a thin layer of occlusive overnight really helps with healing.. Boroline is way nicer to use than Vaseline, and not AS occlusive/ sweaty. \n\nUpdate: I've been using Boroline in winter as a last step! It's not oily or greasy, and doesn't rub off onto my pillow. You can use a small amount in a very thin layer by by rubbing it between your palms, (so it warms up and spreads better) and patting it onto your skin. \n\n\nSUNSCREEN - After much searching and heartbreak, I have settled on\n\n\n+  **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++** *₹249 for 100 ml* (IT'S FUNGAL SAFE. 😭Sobs in gratitude for her sunscreen😭 No white cast. Has fragrance, but it's so mild I had to go smell it to be sure, hehe. Smells kind of like baby lotion... I do get oily midday, but I don't care 😂) 4/5. But I'll never stop using it 😂 UPDATE: The latest formulation is neither greasy nor matte, very natural! - there are concerns about its photostability, FYI. Check reviews in the sub and decide. I now use UVDoux if I'm going outside. \n\n\nSo, here's a sample morning routine:\n\n\nCleanser, Mist/serum, Aloe Gel, Sunscreen. Or skip the mist if it's really humid. \n\n\nAnd for night:\n\n\nMicellar water, Cleanser, Azelaic Acid...wait ten minutes for max effectiveness of azelaic acid, Mist/serum, Aloe Gel + tiny dab of Urea cream, Three drops of C8 Oil. \n\n\n#Technique\n\n\n+ **Firstly**. More important than anything else, even if you're using fungal safe products, you have to prevent your skin from becoming too hot and occluded. If the weather is hot AND humid, **YOU MAY NOT NEED ANY MOISTURIZER** If you \"seal\" it too much, it creates a greenhouse kinda effect, and it won't matter even if your products are safe, the fungal acne grows. Same goes for \"normal\" acne, to some extent.\n\n\n+ **Secondly**, we still want our skin to become healthier and develop resistance, so hydration is important. This is why I recommend the Minimalist 5% niacinamide, 1% hyaluronic acid serum, or something similar. Water, not oil! All creams are a balance of water and oil, and it's the same balance we have to maintain in our skin. Unfortunately, most common emulsifiers will trigger fungal acne, so most creams are out. Hence the layering of water-attracting humectants and emollient, occlusive oil. Same effect, no emulsifying. A lot of oily skinned people are extra oily because their skin is dehydrated - not enough WATER. So I tend to do each step of the routine while the previous step is still DAMP. Very important! That way, the final step seals everything in juuust enough at night. \n\n\n+ **Thirdly**. Don't be afraid to mix to find your \"custom\" moisturizer. If a mist/serum and aloe gel isn't moisturising enough for you, or you just don't want to use mist/serum, add a two drops of C8 oil to the gel and massage that in! The oil will disperse nicely. If it's really humid weather, and you don't want to use oil at night, leave it out! Pay close attention to your own skin. If using urea cream freaks you out, don't use it! 😂❤ Even using two drops of C8 oil on a plain wet face works! As long as your face is WET, otherwise the oil-water balance is too much oil, not enough water.... \n\n\n**A TIP FOR FUNGAL ACNE** (or acne in general) : **TAKE A PROBIOTIC** I used:\n\n\n+ **Dr.Trust Probiotics 25 Billion CFU** *Rs. 899 for 60 capsules* (Follow the instructions. After every course of antibiotics, consider taking a course of probiotics for at least a couple weeks. I wish this was common knowledge. Our gut bacteria is SO IMPORTANT. You may feel gassy with your first dose, but it should subside.) 5/5. Probiotics have improved everything about my health. Even if you don't wanna use this brand or use a supplement long-term, take a probiotic supplement for a while, then take them as needed: after prolonged stress, illness, antibiotic use... Probiotics work only for the time they are being eaten, and yes, daily homemade dahi is a good way to get them ☺\n\nI currently take: \n\n+ **The Blessing Tree Probiotics with Prebiotics** Works fine. \n\nTBH, taking supplements is a matter of good faith. The supplement industry is largely unregulated as to the purity and safety of their products. It's up to customer discretion. So use your own judgement when it comes to whether you wanna take probiotics at all, which brand, for how long, etc. I can only share what I personally do 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n\n**EDIT** : Some FA safe **MAKEUP** ! Just realized someone might appreciate the info 😂 These are things I have personally used:\n\n+ L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte foundation (Shade 108 is close to NC40, I believe) *Rs750 for 30ml* But frequently found online for a bit less. \n\n+ Insight Concealer Foundation (Shade 5 makes for a natural warm-toned concealer-corrector for NC42, Shade 2 is a proper highlighting shade, and Shade 1 I use as eyeshadow primer 😂 These 3 have warm undertones!) *Rs230 for 20ml* \n\n+ Insight 3in 1 Primer *Rs240 for 30ml* but available cheaper sometimes. Literally FOUR ingredients! Gotta love that! \n\n#Other fungal-safe products\n(will continue to link reviews as I try them, or as people on the sub post about them):\n\n\n**CLEANSERS:**\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Sebonac face wash (Skin Rejuvenating Gel) - contains 1% glycolic acid\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Moiz Cleansing Lotion \n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n\n**MOISTURIZERS/HYDRATING SERUMS**\n\n+ Indiabulls Moimax OC Moisturizer Gel ([review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/skgqi7/moimax_oc_oil_control_moisturiser/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), by u/Lazy_Telephone6759) \n\n\n+ Re'equil Oil Free Mattifying Moisturiser (the one in the pump, [this one](https://www.reequil.com/products/oil-free-mattifying-moisturiser?variant=32318341218436&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart-shopping&utm_campaign=all-products&gclid=Cj0KCQiA15yNBhDTARIsAGnwe0Uf0_BxawOYd7w6F_n6oiW9WNRzrfh3auXV-Dih7Zwbj_ceNa32EGcaAvW4EALw_wcB), NOT the oil-free one in the tube). \n\n+ Chemist at Play 2% Pentavitin + 1% Salicylic Acid + 0.5% Zinc PCA - Face Moisturizer For Oily Skin\n\n+ ETUDE HOUSE Soonjung Moist Relief All In One Gel\n\n+ Laneige Water Sleeping Mask (I used to use this, because someone gave it to me from when they went to Korea.

        "body": "I have one very noob question 😶 . So I very recently figured out I have FA. Very recently meaning just last week. Mainly because I just got into skincare couple of months ago. Meaning moisturizing properly twice a day for the first time in my life 😛.\nAnd something went wrong (probably because its raining a lot, so humidity?). I got horrible flare up in both cheeks, jawline, basically everywhere. It was burning and itching. Read up on the symptoms and it looks and feels like FA only.\nI have stopped everything and just using honey and calamine lotion. These two have always calmed down my skin. And going through whatever 2-3 products I had to see if they are FA safe or not.\nNow, back to my noob question. I was planning on trying some ayurvedic oil or any other facial oil, before shit hit the fan. Like Kumkumadi or jwalini etc. But I don't know if they are FA safe or not. Do you have any idea about this? Or if you have tried?",

        "body": "Commenting here again, after a month to say a big THANK YOU!! 😊😊😊\nFinally today, my face is looking how it used to look. Had been one anxious ride but this post has been soooo helpful.\nI am going to share my experience here:\n\n\nFor first 3 weeks, I only used honey mask for 30mins, aloe gel as moisturizer and sealed it with Squalane oil (both in AM and PM). Honey was an organic one and aloe gel was from my own plant. These two calmed down my skin so much. Honey would help with the itching. And on applying aloe, I could see bumps were getting smaller next day. Crazy! Never saw so much difference with natural items :)\nAlso, I did one more weird thing, I am not sure if anyone has tried thie before for FA. I applied teensy bit of boro plus antiseptic cream on the most itchy parts 😶. I did run its ingredients on sezia.co , nothing was flagged as unsafe, so I went ahead. And it did help out! (But I cannot recommend this for everyone, because as much as I searched on net, I couldn't find anyone else's experience with FA and boro plus).\n\nSo in 3 weeks, I didn't get any more itchy bumps for sure. And existing ones also, somewhat smoothed out. But they weren't completely gone. Just 5 days back, I finally bought selsun shampoo. I have used it thrice now, for 3 minutes. Dang it made everything disappear 😂 Also it makes skin very dry, so I bought sebamed clear face care gel also.\n\n\nSo you ask, why was I not buying any treatment for FA? Because I was scared to experiment anything new (even if proven to be effective). I was hoping, I would get my skin to calm down first and then start the treatment. But in hindsight, yes, I could have started some treatment earlier.\nAlthough this little experiment did prove the power of honey+aloe. Mad respect 🙏🙏\n\nJust one last question, is it possible to develop resistance against sulfur also?",

Photos 5 and 6 are from an Orang County, CA TJ Maxx. Stores are clean and organized.\n\nHAUL and mini review: (dry/dehydrating/30/Socal)\n\n**Laneige cica sleeping mask $20 60 mL**. My ride or die cica cream that I always need to have in stock. I ran out in March and was gonna buy more on my Japan trip, but couldnt find it in Japan. I didnt really wanna deal with the shipping and tariffs mess with online retailers so I intended to buy it whenever theres a sale at my local Amorepacific/Aritaum store. Regular price is $34, I was hoping to snag it on a 30% sale for \\~ $25, but TJ Maxx selling it for $20 is fantastic. Even Stylevana only has it on sale for $24 right now. I was devastated that this TJ only has 1 in stock. \n\nMini review: Nothing soothes my skin the way this cica cream does it, especially on hotter days. Its my fall back whenever my skin acts up. 10/10. Have been repurchasing for 5 years I think.\n\nIngredients: Water, Propanediol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Squalane, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Glycerin, Panthenol, Cetearylalcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, 1,2-hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Hydroxyethylacrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Tauratecopolymer, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Sorbitan Isostearate, Asiatic Acid, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**Parnell  cicamanu cotton clear pad $5 90 pads.** This was a clearance item. I didnt even know Parnell sells skincare. I thought they're a makeup company that focuses on cushions. Just checked Stylevana, its being sold for $18.\n\nIngredients: Water, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, C12-14 Pareth-12, Glycereth-26, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glyceryl Caprylate, Betaine, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Leptospermum Scoparium Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Honey Extract, Gluconolactone, Ceramide NP, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Madecassoside, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream $25 30mL + 50mL**. Have not tried. The Dr. Jart cica cream is a thin gel that was too thin for my dry skin so Im hoping this ceramidin cream is thicker. Currently $30 for 50 ML on Yesstyle.\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Methyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetearyl Olivate, Panthenol, Glyceryl Stearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Olivate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, 2,3-Butanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ceramide NP(2,070ppm), Ceramide NG(2,070ppm), Ceramide NS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AP(529ppm), Cholesterol, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cellulose Gum, Dextrin, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Citronellol, Tocopherol, Tartrazine\n\n**S.Nature Aqua Squalane Moisturzing Cream $10 60 mL.** Have not tried.

    "body": "\n[here’s a lil picture](https://imgur.com/a/pdhUDav)\n\nSkintype: Extremely oily & Acne prone\n\nAge: 21 Yrs\n\nFormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n\nReview Type: Liked it but would NOT repurchase \n\nPrice: 699 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: around   2 month with intervals, 2-3 days a week.\n\nIngredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n1. Reviewing FormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n \n* Texture and consistency:  It sinks right in the skin and has a gel like texture. It doesn’t feel heavy nor makes me sweat on application unlike other moisturisers make me do. I loved the fact it’s so lightweight and has the gel consistency.\n\n* Effect/ Result: to be very honest, when I first started using this moisturiser, I felt like it was breaking me out, at one point I even stopped using the moisturiser for a while because I was just upset. I loved the texture so much but had been doubting if it’s breaking me out. But later I realised it wasn’t the moisturiser, it was just my usual hormonal acne. I’ve been using it for 2 months and lately it has been working just fine. \n\n• It has 4% niacinamide, confirmed with brand. I had thought of using it as an alternative to a niacinamide serum, but didn’t show any added visible effects.\n\n* Would not repurchase because: \n1. The price, 699 for a 50 g basic moisturiser?!?!\n2. It does it’s job, moisturises my face. Nothing exceptional about it and honestly the Minimalist moisturiser does the same thing for a lesser price.\n3. It makes my face extremely oily and greasy in an hour. My face looks extremely dull. I wouldn’t use it in day time.\n\n•PROS.\nThe thing I love the most about this moisturiser is its consistency and lightweight feature but then the fact it makes my face oily AF is a bummer :(\n\nCute packaging: I’m a sucker for pastel colours and aesthetics and gohd I love the tube in my skincare cabinet, looks so pretty ✨\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS \nLike I’ve been mentioning again and again, I really wanted to love this moisturiser but the price point and lack of any exceptional feature wouldn’t make me purchase it again. \n\nMinimalist Sepicalm 3% + Oat Moisturizer\n\nReview Type: RAVE\n\nPrice: Rs. 345-349 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: 4 Months, every night and sometimes day too\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n* It has a creamy texture and is quite a thick moisturiser for an extremely oily skin person like me.\n\n* It does not have any actives and I can layer it on top on any active I use, is the fact I love this moisturiser.\n\n* It is decently priced, would definitely repurchase it. \n\n* I’ve used it under makeup and it has worked wonders since the makeup didn’t cause any breakout or any dryness or flakiness.\n\n* I’ve been using it since July, taking a pea sized amount every-night and still have almost 3/5 left, a little goes a long way for me which makes it super affordable. \n\n* I think it’s safe for me to call it my HG moisturiser. It has never broken me out or caused any CCs or any another issue.\n* Literally soothed me, I had been using pulp vit C earlier which was quite strong and potent, Sepicalm moisturiser came handy every time\n\nCONS\n* it’s thick and greasy\n\n* Does not sink in skin immediately unlike the FormulaRX one. It sits on skin for a while\n\n* Makes me sweat after application \n\n* Cannot use it in day (except under makeup)\n\nWhy do I still use it\n- No matter what texture it has, it has soothed my acne, vit C burn, and improved overall skin texture.\n\n- I love the price point \n\n- I use it at night so I don’t worry about how I look, all I care is how well it works. And it does work for me!\n\nI know we’ve missed detailed reviews on this sub here so here’s one from me, more coming in!\nHope y’all find it helpful :)",

It’s an apples to oranges comparison. One is a ceramide moisturiser which has 3 ceramides + phytosphingosine + niacinamide. This usually comes in very expensive creams.\n\nMinimalist on the other hand is the basic moisturiser\n\nIt’s a difference in needs and wants regarding which one would be preferred by a user.",

Not the $8 Korean retail price, but still, it seems really worth it to me considering the amazing ingredients.\n\nPanthenol is especially really underrated but it seriously kicks ass for dry & sensitive skin/tret face like mine (make sure it's at least 5% tho to be most effective). I love the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream bc it's so moisturizing & healing, but it PILLS LIKE CRAZY. Grrrrrrr. And it's a litttle sticky. Otherwise, it would be perfect.\n\n(Also, if you have super tret face/super dry skin, urea is very much worth looking into. It's super underrated as well. It's probably one of the most scientifically proven to be effective dry skin ingredients, but it's not marketed in the US for whatever reason. Maybe bc people think it's from \"urine\"? That's obviously not where they get it in skin care products lol, which is why education is so important. \n\nThe Eucerin 5% Urea face cream is the most accessible one I have found, but there's also Balea? Sebamed, Numis, Medisei Panthenol Extra (also 5% panthenol, but may be clogging) from Greece, Bioturm - all 5% urea creams, for those outside the US. I don't suggest going above 5%, as it can be exfoliating and I personally have those to be really heavy/greasy.",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

    "body": "Skin type: 30. Dehydrated. Dry. Sensitive to external factors.\n\n**1. Muji brightening moisturizing milk spf 41 PA+++**. Previously reviewed in a prior post about trying Muji travel size skincare. Milky texture. Its drying and smells like citrus due to the essential oil. WNR. Feels drying on my skin. Maybe someone with oily skin would like it more.\n\nIngredients: Water, 1, 3-propanediol, fine titanium oxide, talc, dimethicone, concentrated glycerin, sugar squalane, 2-pentanediol, lipophilic glyceryl stearate, behenyl alcohol, PEG stearate, POE (20) sorbitan oleate, PEG (80), lavender extract-1, chamomilla extract-1, calendula officinalis extract, tangerine peel extract, kiwi extract, oleoyl phytosphingosine, alanine, Arginine, sodium L-glutamate, serine, proline, sodium hyaluronate-2, dipentaerythrityl hexaoxystearate, POP methyl glucoside, BG, ethylhexyl glycerin, beeswax, polyhydroxystearic acid, isostearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, hydrated silicic acid, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, starch-sodium acrylate graft polymer, sodium alginate, citric acid, sodium citrate, natural vitamin E, fragrance\n\n**2. Rohto Mentholatum - Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect Gel.** Travel size that I got at a random convenience store while in Japan. Soft gel-like texture. Good in humid weather. Not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Its a decent moisturizer for me in the daytime in the summer. WNR. Again, maybe someone with oily skin may benefit more from this gel.\n\nIngreditents: Water, BG, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, pentylene glycol, PPG-10 methyl glucose, triethyl hexanoin, squalane, (acryloyl dimethyl taurine ammonium / VP) copolymer, behenyl alcohol, acetyl hyaluronic acid Na (super hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid Na, hydrolysed hyaluronic acid (nano-ized hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid hydroxypropyl trimonium (skin-adsorbed hyaluronic acid), hydrolyzed collagen, glucosylceramide (ceramide), suizenzino-polysaccharide (Sakuran), dimethicone, PPG-17 butes -17, triethyl citrate, cyclopentasiloxane, phenoxyethanol, succinic acid 2Na, dimethicone crosspolymer, agarten, EDTA-2Na, succinic acid, α-glucan, acrylate copolymer ammonium , Methyl paraben\n\n**3. Kansosan Medical Highly Moisturizing Cream.** A buttery and moisturizing cream. While shopping at Donki, I googled what is the best Japanese cream for dry and sensitive skin and Kansosan was suggested so I bought it to try. \n\nIts fantastic on my dry skin. It sinks in upon application but also coats my skin with a layer of moisturizing protection. Ive been using it for 2 days now and all I can think about is how amazing this would be for winters. Im gonna stock up when I go back to Japan. I think I found my holy grail moisturizer. I need to try other products from this brand. \n\nThis cream is like the better formulated version of the Kikumasamune sake cream and the Purito Dermide sleeping pack. Plus Kansosan doesnt smell bad. People who enjoy thick moisturizers like the Illiyoon and Aestura would like this cream.\n\nIngredients: Heparin-like substance\\*, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate\\*, Purified Water, Glycerin, Methylphenyl Polysiloxane, Cross-linked Methyl Polysiloxane, Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, 1,3-Butanediol, Methyl Polysiloxane, Polyethylene Glycol-Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, 2-Ethylhexyl Dodecanol, 1,2-Pentanediol, Poly(Oxyethylene-Oxypropylene) Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, Isostearic Acid Hardened Oil, Anhydrous Magnesium Sulfate, α-Olefin Oligomer, Sodium Citrate, Glycerol Mono-2-Ethylhexyl Ether, Sodium Metabisulfite, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Citric Acid, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Sodium Phosphate, Vaseline, Glycosyl Squalane, L-Arginine, Hydrogenated Soybean Phospholipid, Plant Sterols, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Water Soluble Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Polyethylene Glycol Octyl Dodecyl Ether, Plant Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate (2), \n\n\\*denotes \"Active Ingredient\", no symbol denotes \"Other Ingredients\"  \n",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna.

The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

It has niacinamide, rose flower oil, adenosine, Tocopherol and shea butter. I've used two 25ml sample sizes of this (so 50ml used total) and I love this cream. If only it wasn't $90!! This somehow absorbs well despite having the hefty shea butter, works well under makeup. I'm using it now in November, where it is winter in the Northeast, and I don't have any dry flakes. \n\nI was looking for a dupe for this, and found a non-asian dupe. The clinique pepstart hydroblur moisturizer is similar to the Hera rosy satin cream. I used the clinique hydroblur in spring and summer and it is a tad lighter. It does also have shea butter in it. Has ceramide NP, sodium hyaluronate, tocopherol and MANGO SEED BUTTER. \n\nThe thing that really makes me feel like the clinique is the Hera dupe is the texture. They FEEL the same on my skin. Absorbs instantly. \n\nThe Hera is $90 for 50ml and the Clinique hydroblur is $30 for 50ml for comparison. \n\nWhat do you think? Has anyone else used either of these moisturizers? \n\nNote\\* Cosmetic love is having a sale on Hera rosy satin cream for $70, if anyone is interested in trying.\n\n[https://cosmetic-love.com/products/hera-rosy-satin-cream-50ml](https://cosmetic-love.com/products/hera-rosy-satin-cream-50ml)",

    "body": "Nitong nakaraang mga araw may isang Tiktok content creator ang inulan ng comments sa kanyang Tiktok page dahil diumano sa hindi magandang paraan o istilo ng pagrereview ng sunscreen na ito. Dahil dito , naisipan kong bilhin at subukan itong sunscreen na ito. \n\nUna sa lahat, binili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa tingin kong official store nitong Worada sunscreen na ito. Ito yung store na may Worada din sa pangalan. Dito din sa store na ito binili nung content creator na binanggit ko kanina. Yung B1T1 na yung binili ko, yung isa sa usage test, yung isa naman e sa gagawin kong test sa lab. May kasama din pala itong freebie na Whitening Antiperspirant and Deodorant Cream (isusunod ko itong i-review). \n\nSimulan ko muna sa packaging. Yung packaging nito ay 50 g Cosmetic Pouch with spout. Ito ay gawa sa BOPP/VMPET/LLDPE/Aluminum Foil na sinadya para maprotektahan ng husto ang laman na sunscreen. Ito yung isa sa mga usual na material na ginagamit sa paggawa ng mga cosmetic pouch. Makikita din sa packaging na gawa pala ang Worada Sunscreen sa China. \n\nHindi ko nakita sa packaging ng sunscreen na ito yung mandatory warning para sa mga sunscreen na dapat present sa mga sunscreen products na binebenta sa ASEAN: Do not stay too long under the sun, even when using a cosmetic product. \n\nSa paggamit naman. Pagkabukas ko pa lang ng sachet nitong Worada sunscreen, naamoy ko na agad yung fragrance nito. Amoy milky floral ang fragrance na ginamit dito. Ang laman na sunscreen ay isang cream na off-white na may hint ng dilaw ang kulay (mas maputi ng kaunti sa evap na gatas). Kapag inilagay na sa daliri, nagbe-break na agad ang emulsion at nagiging matubig o runny, kagaya nung sa video review. Noong ipinahid ko ang 2-finger lengths nitong sunscreen, una kong napansin e masyadong maputi yung sunscreen para sa skin tone ko. Tinagalan ko na ang pagbe-blend nito sa buong mukha at leeg ko, pero sa huli halata pa din ang whitecast. Nasabihan pa nga ako ng kasama ko sa lab na nagsusumigaw yung sunscreen ko sa mukha. \n\nNgayon sa ingredients naman. Ito ang ingredients nitong Worada sunscreen:\n\nMilk, Aqua, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide, Glycereth-26, Potassium Laurel Phosphate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Isohexadecane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate-80, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Niacinamide, Trehalose, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Parfum\n\nUnahin na natin ang UV-Filters. May tatlo na UV-Filters ang Worada Sunscreen:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \n\n* Ethylhexyl Salicylate (UVB) \n\n* Titanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nBabalikan ko ito mamaya para mai-relate sa product claim nitong sunscreen. \n\nAng pinakaunang ingredient sa IL nito ay Milk. Maling entry na naman. Lac (Milk) ang tamang INCI name kung naglagay ng gatas as ingredient. \n\nRelated naman ang gatas sa susunod kong punto. Gumamit ng Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, at Propylparaben itong sunscreen na ito bilang preservative system. Angkop itong preservative system na ito, dahil ang taas ng ginamit na Milk sa formulation na ito. Nararapat lang na broad spectrum preservative system ang gamitin. \n\nPreservative Efficacy:\n\nParabens: Yeast and molds; Gram(+) bacteria\n\nPhenoxyethanol: Yeast and molds; Gram(-) bacteria\n\nRegarding sa safety ng parabens (methyl, propyl), approved for use pa yan ng regulatory bodies ng ASEAN at EU, basta masunod lang ang maximum allowed concentration. Pakitingnan na lang sa pic yung statement ng SCCS, ang committee na inaatasan ng EU na magsagawa ng safety assessments ng mga ingredients kagaya ng parabens. Pero kung isa ka sa mga nakakaranas ng contact dermatitis dahil sa pagiging sensitive ng iyong balat sa parabens, mabuting iwasan na lang ang mga produktong gumagamit nitong mga preservatives na ito. \n\nSunod, may laman naman itong mga ingredients na moisturizing sa balat: \n\n* Glycerin (humectant) \n\n* Trehalose (humectant) \n\nPara naman sa whitening:\n* Milk\n\n* Niacinamide\n\nMay antioxidant din: Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nSunod nating tingnan ang product claims ng Worada sunscreen:\n\n* SPF 60 PA+++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\n* Invisible\n\n* Waterproof\n\n* Sweat Resistant\n\n* Lsolate Skin (nasa harap, di ko naintindihan kung anuman ito) \n\n* Whitening\n\n* Moisturizing\n\nSa SPF claim, hindi ko mawari kung papaano nasabi ng brand na ito na may UVA protection ito, samantalang yung tatlong UV-filter nito e puro UVB protection ang kayang ibigay. Dagdag pa, wala pa akong nakikitang SPF test report para sa Worada sunscreen na ipinakita ng brand owner sa kanilang soc med accounts. Kung meron man, makikicomment na lang sa baba. \n\nSa claim na invisible, hindi naman invisible e. Kitang kitanang white cast e. \n\nSa water proof claim, hindi pwede ang water proof claim. Water resistance ang tamang ilagay jan. At kailangang may patunay na tinest ito, kesyo ito ay 40 min or 80 min water resistance. Ganoon din sa sweat resistance. May test din para jan, either 40 min o 80 min, kagaya ng water resistance. \n\nYung Lsolate Skin na claim na nasa harapan, malay ko jan. Kailangang i-clarify ng brand owner yan. \n\nSa claim na moisturizing at whitening, meron namang ingredients na laman ang sunscreen para masabi kahit papano na pasok ang claim nila. Ang concern ko lang e yung paggamit ng Milk. Matumal ang mga studies kung sa nakakapagpaputi ang gatas. Tapos, takaw-mikrobyo pa yan. Mabuti na nga lang, ginamitan ng broad spectrum preservative system. Pero kung mahina ang preservative system nito, madaling masisira ang product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nMarami akong concerns na nakita sa product na ito. Una na jan yung kung SPF-tested ba talaga ito. Pangalawa yung claim na may UVA protection, pero malabo base sa mga UV filters na ginamit. Ikatlo, yung mga unallowed (water proof) at unsupported (water resistant at sweat resistant) claims. Yang tatlo na yan, major red flags na agad dahil hindi tama na magki-claim para sa product na hindi pa naman nagtetest. Palaging tandaan, sa mga product claims, laging dapat may kaakibat yan na substantiation. Kasi napakadali gumawa ng product claims, ang mahirap e patunayan kung tunay ba talaga yan. Performance-wise, hindi para sa akin itong sunscreen na ito, dahil ayoko ng whitecast. \n\nAbangan ang Part 2 para sa mga isasagawa kong mga test sa lab. \n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbasa. \n",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "So, I just recently bought into the whole AB shebang. I did my research and came up with a routine, and have been using a blend of mostly Korean and Japanese products for just the past two weeks or so. Here's the thing though. I've noticed that the products that are most raved about here and that are considered HG seem to be considered so mainly because of how they help with acne. I feel like 99% of the folks here are acne-prone and acne and scarring are their main problems. I feel like I belong to a very small minority. I am not at all acne prone. Never have been. My main concern is skin aging as I now have fine lines and some sun damage, including discolorations, and overall skin dullness. I also feel like my skin is dehydrated from a recent wrong encounter with tret. Now, my question is, are most of the HG products here at AB at all helpful for fine lines and other aging skin concerns? Every time I look up a review, the people who rave about the product keep saying over and over again that it helped with their acne. I hardly ever hear anyone saying it helped with their fine lines and dullness and just overall helped make their skin better, healthier, plumper, more radiant. Now, I'm not sure if I bought the wrong products. For instance, is snail supposed to provide benefits apart from helping heal acne and acne scars?\n\nFor reference, here is my current routine:\n\n* **First Cleanser:** Pond's Cold Cream (does the job, IMHO, and is so much cheaper than the Korean alternatives)\n* **Second Cleanser:** Mizon Repairing Foam Cleanser (seems okay but high PH, so I'm planning to replace)\n* **Exfoliator:** 1. Skinfood Black Sugar Wash-Off Mask (I found this too rough on my skin and I didn't really see any brightening or smoothening effects. In fact, after using it my skin felt worse than it was and I even got some scratches from the sharp sugar crystals, even after I diluted it with water and waited for it to melt a little before I started scrubbing)\n* 2. Skinfood Rice Wash-Off Mask (This one I absolutely LOVE. It is gentle and soothing, but it does its job when it comes to physically exfoliating. After first use, it just really removed like magic the wrinkly, dull dead skin cells that were sitting on top of my cheeks and forehead, and left me with baby-smooth, radiant skin.)\n* **Actives:** DIY Vitamin C serum (AM), Retin-A .05% 3x a week, buffered for now (PM)\n* **FTE:** Kiku-masamune High Moist (This one I love and seems to really provide a LOT of hydration, and I noticed an immediate difference in my skin just in the first few days of use, heck, even after the very first application.)\n* **Toner:** Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium (I can't really see what this does. Used it before I got the Kiku and couldn't see any hydration at all. It just feels sticky. Am now using it immediately after the Kiku and I still couldn't see any difference in hydration or plumping or anything like that. Really unsure about this one.)\n* **Essence:** Cosrx Advanced 96 Snail Mucin Power Essence (This is one of the items that seem to be raved about by folks who have acne problems and that I am unsure about any benefits for overall wellness for aging skin)\n* **Ampoule:** Scinic Honey AIO (Another one that I am not sure is beneficial for overall skin wellness for aging skin. Even when I use just a tad, it makes my skin so sticky and I don't really see any of the glow that it's supposed to give, nor the hydration. It looks and feels sticky, not glowy. I'm thinking of getting the LJH Vita Propolis as a replacement, but not sure if that one is also only good for the acne prone.)\n* **Light Moisturizer:** Mizon Black Snail AIO (I don't really see this doing anything for me either, but I admit it's probably too soon to tell, since I am only on, I think, my third week. Thinking of replacing with the Benton Steam Cream, but when I looked that up, again, it seems to be HG only because of how it helps heal acne.)\n* **Eye Cream:** MUZ Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream (I don't think anyone here knows about this brand but I LOVE this. It is dirt-cheap but I feel like it has helped with my undereye wrinkles and dark circles and overall moisture more than any other high-end eye creams I've tried. It contains Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Shea Butter, Sodium Hyaluronate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Solluble Collagen, Houttuynia Cordata Extract and is paraben-free and alcohol-free. I really have seen a noticeable difference in the short time I've started using this.)\n* **Moisturizer:** Physiogel Daily Moisture Therapy (Another that is almost never mentioned here but that really makes a very noticeable difference. Hydrating, plumping, skin tone evening, this gives my skin a subtle radiance and an overall healthy look. I don't understand why no one here seems to know about it or like it. I did see one Korean video where they use this and have heard this is popular in Korea as well.)\n* **Sleeping Pack:** Laneige Water Sleeping Pack (I like this a lot, but I'm not sure if it provides any long-lasting benefits. I feel it may just be the silicone component that makes my skin look so hydrated in the morning, and not real hydration. I love how my skin looks in the morning though, but once you wash it off, it's gone.)\n* **Sunscreen:** Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel (better and more hydrating than the Essence, especially the BB in the pink tube, which is horribly drying and looks horrible on aging skin. I'm also using the Nivea Protect & Moisture and it is a lot more moisturizing than the Biore, but sadly the new reformulated PA++++ is not yet available here and this one is only PA++.)\n\nThat's it. I'm really just hoping to hear from the minority group of ABers who are NOT acne prone, and to hear about possible recommendations and replacements, especially for the Cosrx (and all snail products), as well as for the honey and propolis products. \n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for all the helpful responses. As an update, I have recently developed a better appreciation of both the snails and the Scinic Honey. The trick is to wait at least 5 minutes after the hada labo/toner and after the Advanced 96, and to use THREE pumps, not two, of the Advanced 96. Also, slathering all over the face before patting seems to work better for me. Ever since trying the above methods, I feel as though the products absorb better and they seem to provide better glow and hydration to my skin. After three weeks of the routine, I can definitely say that my skin quality has improved. Not yet dramatically, but it has improved. So, for now, I plan to continue using my snails and honey/propolis products and see where it goes. ",

        "body": "Sorry, this got long, I get passionate about skin care. lol.\n\nSo I'm edging towards mid-30's so I guess I would be in the anti-aging concern group although my original reason for getting into AB was acne (which I've eliminated). As for aging concerns, my concerns are: evening skin tone, eliminating PIH, and preventing wrinkles (I have a laugh line, which gives me thoughts).\n\nI know most reviews discuss acne but this is where you've got to know your science or at least where to look because the only reason you'll have an idea if a product will help with aging is if you do the research (I spent a good 3 hrs yesterday researching products for future purchases to hit on PIH/skintone issues.). Generally, AB skews younger if we take into account this reddit IMO. Some do have aging concerns but in the context of prevention rather than winding the clock back. \n\nIMO, AB offers a great foundation for aging skin. Aging skin: \n\n- losses elasticity (loss of fatty skin), \n- is more dehydrated/ dry, \n- has age spots (UV damage), and \n- wrinkles. \n\nA lot of this can be combated with a routine focused on **hydration and moisture**.  Yes, reviews discuss acne but these same products will likely in some capacity offer hydration and moisture to the skin so they can still be helpful for aging skin. And sunscreen really is non-negotiable. \n\n\nI'm pretty meh about most products you're using but if they work for you, they work for you. I don't use snail because I get hydration from other products in my routine (I find that snail is most useful for soothing, so those who still get acne). I keep moisture through having a med. moisturizer (although I plan on getting an emulsion for summer as I live in a swamp), and an oil, and make sure to use a sleeping pack to protect against waterloss. \n\n\nI have an oil like passionfruit because it supposedly fights free radicals and adds moisture but I'll be repurchasing it because I've seen awesome results in lightening the dark circles around my eyes. I use an FTE because it does brighten my skin overall. I use a BHA because my pores are huge otherwise. And the overall hydration in my routine keeps my skin plump. I'm testing a nonAB retinol right now and added a nonAB arbutin serum (for PIH) to my routine a couple of weeks ago. I notice the difference in my skin when I skip my routine for a few days -- loss of vibrancy in my skin, my laugh line is more prominent, and my skin is not plump. \n\n\n*Future purchases*: Me making a purchase decision is like making a plan of attack. I've adjusted my decision making recently and really only decide on purchasing if I find it'll add value to my skin based on research and a target to what my concerns are. \n\n- I'll add an oil like prickly pear and marula because I've heard so much about their antioxidant power and fatty acid content (I'm pretty much, gimmie all the fats). \n\n- I'm searching for the best Vit C serum and acid peel to attack the discoloration/PIH I have and I'll be re-adding a niacinamide product soon (personally, I don't know if niacinamide does anything for my skin but I'll give it another shot). \n\n- I'll be adding Stratia's liquid gold as well because it's an easily attainable product that I know hits the 3-1-1 ratio needed for actual ceramide penetration of the skin (which I think is important for aging skin). \n\nI'm adding all these things but they are on top of a routine that provides moisture/ hydration for my skin. If I feel like I'm missing something or something isn't performing, I'll add another product. Right now, I'm using HL Albutin moist lotion and I don't think it provides the hydration I need so when I finish it (hopefully in the next week or two) I'll replace it with another hydrating toner.\n\nBut I'm gonna be honest these products will not replace an Rx like tret or any retinoid. So, I view my routine as the accompaniment rather than the star. It'll provide the foundation so my skin can with stand a strong Rx (when I add one). My friend is a derm and really likes that I'm knowledgable about skin and ingredients but is very clear that tret is the best form of defense against aging (and acne) and likes to bring the papers to me, lol.  \n\n**TLDR**: Having an Rx like tret combined with a proper routine of moisture/ hydration, sunscreen protection, and a healthy lifestyle are the best methods to wind back the clock.",

Off the top of my head, I feel like the most raved about products are Benton Snail Bee Essence (for soothing acne or redness), Scinic Honey AIO (for overall brightening), Cosrx AHA and BHA (for a tonne of issues), and Hada Labo/Kikumasamune/Cezanne Lotion (for hydration). I honestly don't think there are that many acne specific products that have literally zero use for anyone without acne. BHA can be a preventative for acne, but it's also good for sebum control and SFs. AHA can help active acne or PIH from acne, but it's also good for cell turnover for brightening including anti-aging concerns like dullness and PIH from sun damage (which tends to be a bigger problem the older you get because you start to see the long-term effects of damage gained years ago). Vitamin C helps pigmentation, whether that's from acne or sun damage. The plethora of hydrating products is good for pretty much everyone, whether they use one or several.\n\nStill, there have been good general recommendations, and hopefully this thread helps those who do feel there aren't products for them.",

All very meh products for my skin.  \n\nI liked the Cosrx snail - it was moisturizing and helped curb the redness I have in my cheeks, but ultimately switched to benton because that provides better redness relief and I already have tons of hydrating products. I don't have acne to heal, so I cant comment on its healing properties per say, but the occasional stress spot, disagreeing product while testing or time of the month spot, I find goes away faster. With that said, maybe you just don't benefit from it? And thats ok.  \n\nI also like the premium version of the hado labo - i dont use it every day, but I do use before a sheet mask or mask treatment - i feel it preps my skin and allows those preceeding products to absorb into my skin better.  \n\nBut with everything, ymmv as always. It took me months to find products that I really loved. So after the initial fangirling of AB went away, I started just focusing more on what ingredients worked well for my skin. But its alot of trial and error. I love the AB skincare philosophy and I will never give up my SK-II FTE, cleansing balms, hydrating toners and sunscreen... but every other step I've moved onto western products.",

Whenever I've dropped one or the other (or both) from my routine I start to see a lot of changes creeping back in within a month or so. Ceramides are nice, too.\n\nAside from retinoid use since my teens, I'm also a heavy vitamin C user since my 20s (late 30s now)-- currently using a combination of LAA and SAP on alternate days (Drunk Elephant C-Firma for LAA/ferulic or 3ish layers of HABA VC-Lotion for SAP). My skin loves SAP daily but LAA is stronger, so I split the difference and just alternate currently. I've experimented with one or the other over the years and the combo is working nicely.",

There doesn't seem to be many posts from older Redditors. As previous posts have mentioned, the age group of this sub skews much younger. I'm in my 40's and I've used some AB products for years (mostly Shiseido sunscreen and makeup) but didn't make the switch to all-AB skincare until 6 months ago. I was initially using a lot of Mizon products (I'm one of the suckers that way overpaid on products from Peach and Lily!) and, because my skin was so dehydrated, saw a huge improvement. However, the progress plateaued quickly once the dehydration was addressed. I went through a a couple months of buying and using many HG products that are often discussed in the sub, but didn't see much effect. Then I stumbled onto Sulwhasoo products and Vitamin C and I really began to see results. My skin has never felt so soft, been so plump, and many people have remarked that I have the AB glow. There are people on here who dismiss Sulwhasoo products as ineffective. My suspicion is they are probably younger and have skin which does not lack in whatever Sulwhasoo products replace in more mature skin so they don't see any improvement. I haven't quite picked out my HG products because I've been buying samples of their lines on Amazon and eBay (MUCH more cost-effective), but overall I've gotten better results from Sulwhasoo than anything else I've tried.",

More we are, and more different products we can discover! \nI've the same concerns: fine lines and first wrinkles and sun damages too.\n I'm turned 34 and I'm  relatively new AB \"player\" :). Since I've started my skincare routine, my skin really improved. It appears more firm, with less dark spots,  elastic and hydrated. \nI started around 3-4 months ago. I would like to share with you some ingredients that work, at least for me: vitamin c (Timeless serum) , niacinamide (Naruko Magnolia toner, Joseon cream) , honey and Propolis (banila co miss flower and miss honey oil and cream, they contain also niacinamide)  Ginseng (Sulwhasoo first care activating serum and the overnight sleeping masks), Ceramides (I use sheet masks at the moment, but I've ordered a couple of products and still waiting), Hyaluronic Acid (Timeless)  and Snail (Cosrx snail essence and cream, Mizon Snail Recovery Gel, Snail ampoule and eye repairing cream) \nI use once a week chemical exofoliators (aha and bha) after vit c serum in the evening. I don't want to be much aggressive to my skin. \nIn my morning routine I try to add more products based on niacinamide (toner, essence and moisturizer). In the evening I use actives (vit c every day, aha and bha once a week), then I include products with Ginseng, Hyaluronic Acid and Ceramides. Sometimes I also add honey/propolis even if they contain niacinamide.\nI always finish my evening routine with sleeping mask: my best choices are Sulwhasoo overnight and radiance mask, and Cosrx rice overnight spa mask. \n\nI start to paid attention to the cosdna, because I add several layers and I prefer use products more natural as possible and without potentially harmful chemicals. On my last order I've added yuripibu, make p:rem, huxley and I'm Real products. \nI'm really excited to get them. \n\nI have a lot of fun with sheet masks, I try to do at least 3-4 times per week.",

        "body": "You completely read my mind, I was wondering about this for the past few weeks when I realized that way more people posting here is pretty young and has acne problems and only very few people talks about anti-aging products. I was planning to ask recommendations from people over 35+ soon.\n\nI have been at AB for only 3 months but I think somehow I avoided buying completely wrong products and even though anti-aging skin care won't show results so fast I will just keep using it as it seems to make my skin nicer. I'm 46 and didn't really think that much about skincare until last winter. I have been using vitamin C, AHA, resist serum and 1% retinol (besides moisturizer) from Paula's choice for the past 3 years but very inconsistently and didn't know about the PH dependent use of acids so not sure how much good what I was using did anyway. I didn't think about my skin being bad and I don't have that much wrinkles except creppines under eyes that is a problem especially when I can't sleep and am in a pain (I have fibromyalgia). But after jumping on AB wagon I started to scrutinize my face and found that my skin is kind of uneven, dull and big pores. Here is what I think are supposedly anti-aging ingredients in products that I use or going to use soon.\n\nRetinol - I didn't realized that retinol is not used as much in AB products until I couldn't find many. I did get AgeVetoLAB retinol night moisturizer that has micro-encapsulated 2.5 % retinol, vitamin C, niacinamide, peptides, HA, vitamin E and green tea. And just started using   couple weeks ago Naruko ampm  A40 pore minimizing complex that is 4% retinol. That one is pretty strong so I use tons of moisture layers before and after. I use that one twice a week. I never used retinol that was more than 1% so this might actually have some effect as the previous PC retinol and retinol booster never made me flake much.\n\nGinseng - Some ginseng products I incorporated are Hanyacho black ginseng bogam toner by Tonymoly and Sooyeran wild ginseng essence by Saem that is very thick, looks almost like honey but spreads well and its not sticky.  Also have sample of Sulwhasoo concentrated ginseng renewing cream EX  that I really like and consider getting more of the sample size because of the cost. \n\nVitamin C - I tried OST 20 but I'm back to western one Timeless with cerulic and vitamin E.  Not sticky at all. Also got Matrixyl 3000 from Timeless that I started to use before Vitamin C just a couple weeks ago, found it while researching more antiwrinkle stuff for my eyes. \n\nAcids - daily using cosrx blackhead power liquid and Mizon Aha 8% peeling serum. Once a week I use Paula's choice Resist 10% weekly treatment and (re)fresh 15%  fruit acid gel peel. Going to try PHA so I have Make P:rem pha serum, booster and night cream on the way, found great deal of all 3 for 58 USD on eBay. Also use Naruko mandelic acid masks. \n\nPropolis - I just finished Scinic propolis 95 ampoule and no I'm going to try Graymelin propolis 80. Nothing wrong with Scinic just want to experiment a bit. I also got the LJH  vita propolis but was shocked when I saw how tiny it is for the price so using only few drops with moisturizing emulsion. \n\nNiacinamid - the strongest I found is Paula's choice  Resist 10% niacinamide booster. You can add it to other stuff or just apply straight. Haven't started it yet as I have a lot of stuff with it right now. I'm using Manyo factory galactomyces niacin essence and Nature republic white vita flora capsule essence that has 5%. Also for brightening and dullness I use Naruko ampm skin immaculate duo that has 7% arbutin, 5% vitamin B3, 3% tranexamic acid. My skin looks brighter but since I'm using more than 1 product for that I can't tell what does what. I guess I will find out when I will stop using specific products.\n\nCeramides -  using dr. Jart  Ceramidin liquid, just finished Dynasty cream which I will repurchase later (have few new creams  mostly moisturizing for warm months waiting their turn), have Skin watchers ceramizing cream ready for next winter, I decided to wait to use till then as it might be heavier. \n\nAntioxidants - green tea I have Innisfree green tea serum about to start and Innisfree green tea sleeping pack that is great for moisturizing. And I really like Tonymoly chok chok green tea watery cream as moisturizer and Tonymoly black tea London classic eye cream. \n\n\nSnail - starting second bottle of Mizon snail repair intensive ampoule, using also alternatively with Benton Snail bee high content essence or lotion, when needed also steam cream. Basically there is always at least one step that contains snail. \n\nGreat for overall anti-aging properties - Freeset donkey milk 3D  moisture cream has NMFs, lipids, licorice and chaga mushroom as powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits and also niacinamide. Only been using for 3 weeks but already got two more backups for great price as I  love it. Also love Innisfree soybean energy cream, feels soft as butter. Soon will start Saem power ampoule anti wrinkle with black yeast ferment. Also got bifida ferment and beta glucan from Graymelin, Zymogen fermented soybean firming serum that has peptides, ferments and ceramide 3 and waiting for Innisfree ginger oil serum. For second eye cream I just added Peter Thomas Roth mega rich intensive anti-aging eye cream that has 4 peptides and ceramide. And two more serums I have been using  and are not AB (and got seconds of) are bareminerals skinlongevity serum and Hey honey, Good morning silk honey serum that also have sea buckthorn oil. I like to use 3-4 different serums at AM and PM so that's why I have so many. Skincare wardrobe all the way. I also use tons of hydrating layers that I'm not gonna mention here as I wanted to keep it mostly to anti-aging stuff that doesn't get mentioned as much.\n\nAgain I have no idea if any of this actually works for anti-aging but better be safe than sorry. I guess I will see in few years.",

So my routine focuses first on preventing acne (which it does VERY, VERY well), but secondly strongly on anti-aging. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't necessarily see those two things as being mutually exclusive.\n\nHere's what I use: Timeless Vitamin C, Hada Labo Gokujyun, The Ordinary Matrixyl (peptide serum for anti-aging), Japanese sunscreens, Clean and Clear persagel 10% BP, Paula's Choice Resist Intensive Wrinkle Repair Retinol serum, and Beauty of Joseon cream (I'm going to try switching this up soon just for fun).

And though some acne-related products help with my main concerns as well, it has still been a bit harder for me to find the right products. I mostly suffer from dryness, sensitivity, uneven skintone/redness, large pores in my nose and some wrinkles and discolorations from the first 31 years of my life when I didn't care about sunscreen that much... (I guess I thought that sun doesn't damage skin here in Scandinavia... well I was wrong.) I do get some occasional breakouts but those are so minor that I don't focus my skincare on them. \n&nbsp;\n\nIt's still too early for me to say what products tackle these problems most efficiently, but one product that I've noticed to help in almost all my concerns is the **Benton Snail Bee High Content sheet mask**. After I use it the wrinkles in my forehead look visibly smoother, it calms down the redness, evens out skin tone and really moisturizes well too.  Other masks with snail don't seem to do as much, so I guess my skin really likes the bee venom. I'm waiting for my Cosrx Advanced 96 Snail Mucin Power Essence to run out so I can try the Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence and see if that really works better.\n&nbsp;\n\nBtw, in addition to this sub I've got a lot of help from Gothamista's Youtube channel, because she talks a lot about brightening, anti-aging and moisturizing products. Some are way out of my budget though but then I scan the ingredients and try to find a cheaper product with similar ones to try out.",

The snail and honey are mostly for hydration, honey or propolis giving me major glow (tosowoong honey sheet masks). Cosrx snail cream essence is good as a layering moisturizer to counter redness and heal skin woes- my skin dislikes heavy moisturizers. Overall hydrated skin helps fight wrinkles.\n\nI've been using Manyo Factory's Galactomyces essence which also has niacinamide in it. That has been more effective at evening tone, improving texture than Cosrx's version. Just started introducing vitamin C into my routine a couple of months ago and haven't been using it on a consistent basis enough to know if it's helping. I assume it's a very slow process, as most anti-aging products are. SK-II FTE was also great at evening my skin tone and fighting dullness when I was still using it.\n\nI probably need to add in aha one day, but for now hydrating products do a great job at making my skin look younger. The effects I get from a honey or a hydrating snail mask a couple times a week are pretty crazy. And I'm not sure if this is a good way to buy products, but I start with various sheet masks with different \"active\" ingredients. I use that to find which ingredients might work best for my skin since sheet masks are usually cheap. From there I search for essences or serums with those ingredients.\n\nAlso, thanks for the info on the kiku toner, I've been considering it for a future purchase and have been on the fence.",

Luckily, this one did not and really hydrated my skin, which lasts through the next day.\n\nThese are pretty good!  Maybe even great, depending on your skin's needs.\n\nThey come split into two parts.  The mask material itself is cross-hatched and sturdy.  You can give it a good tug while fitting it on our face and it's no big deal.  Other than that, it feels like regular mask material (cotton).  The fit for me was good.  It was definitely big enough to cover most my (normal-sized) face with a bit to spare.  \n\nVery saturated with the juice.  It's not a creamy formula, just the usual serum style.  And get this...NO FRAGRANCE.  I know many people love the nice smelling stuff, but this one is great option for people who can't tolerate it.  Plus it has tons of ceramides.\n\nIn terms of how long until the masks drys out...well I've never made it that far.  I wore one yesterday for 40min (youtube! stop being so distracting!), pulled it off and it was still soggy.\n\n\n**Ingredients List:** Water, Butylene glycol, glycerin, 1,2-hexanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycereth-26, Propanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Betaine, Allantoin, Cellulose, Hydroxyethyl cellulose, Sodium hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydrogenated lecithin, Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Arginine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Acetate, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Glyceryl Acrylate/ Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n\nOverall, I would rate this mask positively.  It's hydrating and benign...which is what I look for in a mask.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\nGood material\n\nNo fragrance\n\nHydrating AF\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\nCost (USD 3$/mask)\n\n\nEdit: my goodness I need to learn to spell",

    "body": "Thiamidol (INCI: *Isobutylamido Thiazolyl Resorcinol*) is a patented and revolutionary tyrosinase inhibitor developed by Beiersdorf. It's found only in Eucerin and Nivea products. That said, finding the right Thiamidol containing products can be confusing as product names and packaging can vary slightly by country;  ingredients can vary due to local regulations or manufacturing updates; some products are designed for face, others for body, acne-prone skin, or mature skin. Fortunately, the packaging is often **color-coded** (rose gold, red, green, etc.) to help us distinguish them. This guide is a work in progress and aims to clarify the options. **All the products listed below contain Thiamidol.**\n\nIf I missed one, got something wrong, or if you’d like to help build a full list, please comment!

Still probably way higher than most other brands).\n\nThough with these products in general, particularly for the ones with “real” (not pseudo/ceramide precursors), honestly I would be shocked if they were present at more than 0.1 %. Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations. Maybe I’m too cynical, but a >1% concentration of any ceramides would be such a HUGE selling point (not to mention very expensive to produce) that I can’t believe they’re not advertising it\n\nLike Regimen is coming out with one and they are trumpeting the HELL out of it (and I mean fair enough)",

I think people are \"desensitized\" to the marketing/labeling w/r/t percentages of acids because of the Ordinary pushing their dumb MAX PERCENTAGE MINIMUM PH nonsense, but I bet this will be a nice starter acid toner, an alternative to something like the Pixi Glow Tonic with a bit MORE oomph (as the pH is lower.) I personally might try it out as an alternative to my CosRX AHA/BHA Toner (although they are not the same and the CosRX is more like the Pixi in that its more inert/less active.)

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %.

It's completely unfragranced but the product itself smells a little... Mouldy? I knew it smelt bad from reviews but I wasn't expecting it to really smell that unpleasant. I'm used to it now though and have a completely unfragranced routine. If you're accustomed to fragranced products I think you'll definitely find this unbearably unpleasant.\n\nI will say the texture itself is quite pleasant. It's got a silky smooth texture that spreads easily. You don't need a lot which is good but I'm definitely using it up more quickly than I was expecting.\n\nI'll probably stick with it for 3 months to see if there's any improvement but at the moment I'm seeing a small improvement in overall skin tone but not much improvement on sun spots that I wanted this product to fade. I do use this after TO Niancinamide so hopefully the peptide brighteners work together!",

Usually, lotions mean light emulsions.

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules. Overall I feel like it helps existing acne heal more quickly and keeps it from getting to that huge, inflammatory state. It applies and dries down very nicely and I typically wait 15-20 minutes after application to apply moisturizer. I didn't realize until recently that it has niacinamide, which I had thought didn't agree with my skin because it was also in CeraVe PM, but I think it has really helped lighten my PIE, particularly a spot on my forehead that I really went to town on last year and it was a pain in the ass to heal.\n\n*Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol*\n\n**Links that I found helpful along the way**  \n[Try a gentle hydrating cleanser -- even if you have oily skin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7j6juf/psa_try_a_gentle_hydrating_cleanser_even_if_you/)\n\n[Routines which involve inadequate cleansing, high moisture, and heavy occlusion are risky...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/86twai/psa_routines_which_involve_inadequate_cleansing/)",

    "body": "Mask sheet War \n\nA little history \n\nWhen someone ask me what the most unique Korean beauty product is, I will say “sheet mask” without 1 second of hesitation. There are millions of mask sheets from all (not even almost) Korean brands, from 99 cents mask of Skinfood to 40$ per piece luxury mask of Amore Pacific. Actually, from the troika era of Korean road shop (Early 2000, Missha / The Face Shop / Skinfood,) 1000 Korean won (1$) masks were popular. However, the launching of Genics’ Cell Derma Hydrogel Mask Pack, aka Ha Yumi Pack (하유미팩) triggered sheet mask war in Korean beauty industry. They launched through Hyundai Home Shopping and GS Home Shopping, they sold more than 10 million USD (Korea is a small country, this is pretty a lot lol). Now, hydro gel masks are from everywhere, but back then, Cell Derma’s hydro gel mask was somewhat innovative and sensational in Korean beauty industry, because Genic is the first company, made sheet mask with hydro gel in Korea. After the success of Genic, many Korean companies jumped on “mask sheet” bandwagon. \n\nNow, the big 3 are\n\nA. Mediheal : Mediheal began with small company, providing low-priced sheet mask to Olive Young (Korean cosmetic multi-shop). They have become famous with their signature hydration mask “NMF Aquaring mask.” With an interesting packaged design with IV bottle, they got fame on internet as well. Mediheal has very specific segmentation on their products. There are 11 different kinds of masks for their basic line “essential.” They have several hydro gel masks as well as eye patches. \n\nRecommendation: WHP White hydrating Charcoal Mineral Mask \n\nMediheal’s best seller with their signature NMF Aquaring line. Good amount of Niacinamide & Sodium hyaluronate prevents pigmentation while moisturizes your skin. The sheet is black because it contains charcoal of Quercus phylliraeoides (They said it’s for clarifying but I could not find any reliable article, so I just mentioned this as a fun factor.) \n\n\n\nB. Leaders: Leaders originally owned by a medical net work (Leader Plastic Surgery & Dermatology Clinic) but now it is sold to other cosmetic brand. Before, they used to produce cosmeceuticals only, but now they have become a kwon mask sheet brand. With mediheal’s Aquaring, Leaders’ Aquaringer became popular but now they make lots of sheet masks with interesting sheet material (fermented coconut gel) and pretty functional package. \n\nRecommendation : Leaders First Ampoule Mask ( Snail Therapy)\n\nThe mask contains in the test tube (시험관팩). They used chamomile extract / snail mucin as its BASE, meaning no water. It contains other moisturizing agent and no phenoxy ethanol nor parabens. It contains LOTS of serum so you can keep pour the serum on the top of the mask. (In my personal & humble opinion, this is the best sheet mask for me. Lol) \n\n\n\nC. SNP: SNP got on the business with low priced pore masks then quickly became a best selling internet based (mostly Gmarket and Auction) cosmetic brand in late 2000. They introduced animal sheet masks and sold more than 10 million pieces, and keep introducing sheet masks with interesting features. \n\nRecommendation: Bird’s nest Aqua Ampoule Mask\n\nI’m not sure what Bird’s nest extract can do for our skin, it was added for the third ingredient. Witch Hazel extract and Centella Asiatica extract calm your sensitive skin and promote healing. It feels quite refreshing but be aware it contains ethanol, if it concerns you. \n\nRising Stars\n\nA. Jay Jun: Brand name from a famous plastic surgery clinic in Korea. They got famous with “Refine to Shine” black mask. They are one of the first company that attached serum and cleanser in a separated pouch \n\nRecommendation : “refine to shine” mask sheets” \n\nIt contains good amount of hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and moisturizing agent. Cleansing foam and serum is attached as well, so it is really convenient for travel. \n\n\n\nB. Papa’s recipe: Papa’s recipe is a mega rookie in the market. The CEO began to make organic jojoba oil for his daughter, and they got famous with the pure white cream. Their My bottle lemon / Aloe soothing gel is also well known, along with its famous Bom Bee mask. \n\nRecommendation:  Bom Bee Honey Mask\n\nProbably, the year 2016’s best seller in Korea, Korean bloggers call it “Honey Jar Mask” because of the printing on the mask sheet envelope. It smells very honey, and contains honey derived ingredients such as honey extract and propolis. Trehalose & hyaluronic were also added as moisturizing agent along with butylenes glycol and small amount of allantoin for anti-inflammatory function. It’s also phenoxy ethanol and paraben free product.  \n\nLove, \n\nRandy",

The saliva contains EGF (epidermal growth factor) and is supposed to be incredibly beneficial for elasticity and brightening. If I'm remembering right, TCM actually uses it in teas and soups, which gives the consumer a different set of health benefits.

Most of the products that I tested seemed to be no more than a thin layer of 'hydrogel' coated on to nonwoven material and soaked in liquid formulation that just drips everywhere once you take it out of the pouch. The ingredients in the face masks were nothing special; mixture of 'buss word' ingredients. I didn't see any technologically in the hydrogel face mask that would aid absorption of the actives in the formulation into the skin. Perhaps I was asking for too much?",

    "body": "**Skin Type:** normal? not too oily, not too dry. Skin is only sensitive to some ingredients, otherwise good with most. More focused on aging.\n\n**Climate:** Hot and humid, tropical country. But with aircon inside haha\n\nLegend:WRP - would repurchaseMRP - might repurchase (reasoning given)NRP - not repurchaseHG - holy grail, love it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Toners**\n\n* **Muji - Sensitive Skin - Light Toning Water - Moisture (MRP - for flights)**  \nMeh. It was ok. Liked it for flights. Can't layer it though because it just builds up stickiness imo. Ingredients list doesn't have much in terms of star ingredients, so would prefer something with more interesting ingredients if I'm going to spend money.\n* **KikuMasamune - High Moist Conditioning Lotion (WRP)**  \nLove it. Loved the faint scent of sake that quickly dissipated. Easy to spread and pat in. With the spray top, I apply liberally everywhere. I noticed my texture issues on the back of my upper legs (rough texture, not KP) improved significantly when consistently applying.\n\n**Eye Creams**\n\n* **Innisfree - Jeju Orchid Eye Cream (MRP - if I’m feeling vain)**  \nVery solid/thick cream. Does seem to brighten eyes if used for several days-weeks in a row. Hard to tap in though, which means I find it annoying to use. I tried applying to other areas, such as forehead and neck, but didn't see any change in texture (no surprise) nor plumpness (a bit disappointing). I suspect the caffeine is the key ingredient here, but I've caffeine in other products, so maybe I don't need a specialised eye cream unless it has other amazing ingredients. Am transferring to a pump bottle to see if I'm inclined to use it more often.\n\n**Chemical Exfoliants**\n\n* **Somethinc - AHA 7%, BHA 1%, PHA 3% Weekly Peeling Solution (WRP)**  \nLike it so far. I use twice a week. It's definitely acidic af - I accidentally forgot I had just popped a pimple, wiped the solution over that open wound and it BURNED SO BAD. Pleasant scent and feel, not too watery but definitely not jelly/sticky. Just followed the instructions and it was fine. I wouldn't go any stronger an acid mix.\n* **COSRX - BHA Blackhead Power Liquid (MRP - potentially if I feel like my legs need it?)**  \nSpread nicely. Didn't leave any residue. Didn't notice much of an effect (likely to it being betaine salicylate and not salicylic acid). Pump was malfunctioning, so put in a spray bottle. Ultimately end up using on my dry, KP legs as it was moisturising and not too strong a BHA. Was able to use it even after I had physically exfoliated my legs. Legs seem fine with just physical exfoliation, but my KP is more mild as I've aged.\n\n**Essences/Serums**\n\n* **COSRX - Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (Edit to WRP)**  \nCan be a bit sticky. If I use this, I'm almost guaranteed to have a sticky finish after layering everything. I didn't seem to notice much impact on my hydration/moisture after using this. Just that it was sticky. When I started using it up on my arms, even my partner (who doesn't read this sub) commented, \"ugh, your arm feels like snail\" (we've a snail infestation in our garden). Didn't have the heart to tell him he was right..  \nEdit: dustyshelves shared the secret to fixing this issue - apply an oily product afterwards! My Manyo moisturiser is perfect afterwards.\n* **COSRX - Galactomyces 95 Tone Balancing Essence (MRP - if I keep trying different actives)**  \nNice light essence. Felt somewhat soothing, even compared to the snail essence. Would reach for this more often than others. Seems like a good staple if I ever get close to destroying my skin barrier. But with ferments in my Kiku toner and my Manyo ampoule, I feel like this is overkill.\n* **Rohto - Melano CC Essence (WRP - HG)**  \nAmazing. I applied it on a PIH spot that kept getting reinflammed and even when it stopped getting aggravated, stayed dark for months-years. I was so self-conscious of it, even concealer wasn't enough to hide it. Within a couple of weeks of applying daily on that spot, it's almost completely gone. Been applying to any freshly closed wound, which has reduced my PIE/PIH time significantly as well as reduced any raised scarring. Only using as a spot treatment though, so I can avoid the oiliness.\n* **COSRX - Blemish Spot Clearing Serum (NRP)**  \nOk. I think maybe because I don't often get acne (just hormonal, 1-2 a month), so I don't see the effect. I use it when I'm consciously going a bit heavier than usual with actives (introducing an active for the first time, having more than 1 active at a time, etc). I do use it when I've an active pimple, but I also take very close care of my active pimples by also using pimple patches, so it's hard to say the impact. For post inflammation, I use Melano CC the moment the wound is closed, even if it's still healing on the inside.\n* **Manyo - Bifida Biome Complex Ampoule (WRP - HG)**  \nLove it. I got this as a step up from The Ordinary Caffeine + EGCG, and it's a huge step up. I'm impressed with the thought that when into the design - the dropper tip is angled which means it doesn’t drip. Doesn't leave any weird residue. Absorbs well, noticed an improvement after about a week of use, particularly on my forehead where I double-layer it. I also really appreciate that the amount is significantly more than the average serum. I also love the numerous/well-rounded ingredients - feels like it kills several birds with one stone (ferments, niacinamide, caffeine, peptides, sodium hyaluronate, etc).\n\n**Moisturisers**\n\n* **Muji - Sensitive Skin - Moisturing Milk - Moisture (MRP - arms/legs)**  \nOk, can tolerate. Felt fine using on arms and legs. One pump per arm and one pump per half leg was a good quantity that didn't leave an icky finish. On face, it just wouldn't seem to sink in - perhaps I applied too much (one pump for my whole face).\n* **Curel - Intensive Moisture Facial Cream (MRP - if cannot find a cheaper replacement - Manyo maybe)**  \nAlways on the top of Cosme. Like it - very light and soft, easy to spread. Seems to moisturise ok, not juicy but enough. No icky residue. I enjoyed it. Just worried about the quantity versus the price tbh.\n* **Isntree - Aloe Soothing Gel - Moist (MRP)**  \nIt sinks in so fast that it's like I didn't apply anything. It's perfect for a daytime moisturiser in a hot and humid country. But tbh it feels like it does nothing for me, and I'm at the point where I need a moisturiser for 'aging'. So would recommend for a younger person in a hot and humid place.\n* **COSRX - Green Tea Aqua Soothing Gel Cream (MRP - prefer Hada Labo)**  \nDoes feel soothing when applying. Feels more occlusive than the Curel. I find myself reaching for this when I'm worried about actives, though the Curel also seems to do just fine. In terms of immediate effects, I think this leaves me more glowy. Prefer the Hada Labo.\n* **Hada Labo - Anti-Aging + 3D Lifting Gel Moisturizer (WRP - HG)**  \nSurprising - the texture is a clear gel that appears liquidy but is a bit more chunky when dipping in. It sinks into my skin so quickly, my skin absorbs it faster than the COSRX Green Tea Gel and doesn't have much (if any) residue. Like, I apply, and it just disappeared on my skin. Feels lightweight, but lacks the 'refreshing/cooling' feeling of the COSRX. I put it in a pump and like it much better that way. Let's be honest - this is perfect for when you want to do skincare but have bedroom activities planned after (no scent, no residue, sinks in fast).\n* **Manyo - Rich Moisturizer Bifida Biome Concentrate Cream (WRP - HG)**  \nAgain, I love the numerous/well-rounded ingredients - feels like it kills several birds with one stone (ferments, niacinamide, lactobacillus, 5 peptides, 5 ceramides with cholesterol to balance, EGCG and caffeine, 2 forms of HA, etc). It does take a while to sink in, but your skin feels so smooth after. Even the following morning and afternoon, it felt smooth. Feels almost slightly oily afterwards, but I suspect that's it being occlusive? It does have almost a lychee smell - it's pleasant and not overpowering, but it's noticeable when you first apply it.\n\n**Lips**\n\n* **Holika Holika - Good Cera Super Ceramide Lip Oil Balm (WRP)**  \nWorks quite well. Just need to make sure to gently exfoliate lips gently at least once a day. After applying once a night, solved my lip cracking problem as it stays throughout the night. Other lip balms never could do this for me. Does have a strong baby powder smell to it though - was a bit alarming at first, my brain kept telling me I had powder in the back of my mouth, even though there was nothing there. Eventually my brain got back to reality after a week of application. Works best when I use my non-AB oil-based lip cream, then apply this on top.\n* **Klavuu - Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack (MRP - if I can't find an equally affordable replacement that doesn't irritate my throat)**  \nGreat occlusive. I actually use this to seal in the Holika Holika balm when I haven't hydrated enough during the day and know I'm probably going to peel/crack at night. That being said, I have to be careful because if it gets into my mouth, it gives me an itchy/sore throat.\n\n**Sunscreens**\n\n* **The SAEM - Mineral Homme Black Sports Sun Stick (MRP - if other substitutes don't glide better)**  \nWanted a sun stick for my eye area, thinking it might solve my smudging eye makeup as well as cover any area that might still be wet when applying sunscreen. It looks (and smells ) like a men's mini deodorant, though the scent doesn't linger, it still makes me double check if I'm applying deodorant to my eyelids. It glides like a deodorant as well (is that normal?) I worry about dragging my eyelids around and hurting the sensitive skin there.\n\n**Body**\n\n* **Curel - Intensive Moisture Balm (MRP - wondering about less oily alternatives)**  \nThick white balm, way denser than the face cream. Hard to spread on dry skin, I found it easier to spray a bit of toner on first before applying. Quite oily until it sinks it (with the significant amount I use on my dry af legs, that would take about 30 min-1 hour). But it does wonder for my dry, scaly legs. I still have a bit of texture/discoloration, but it isn't raised/prominent.\n\n**Hair**\n\n* **Liese - Wave Styling Foam (NRP)**  \nHold what hold? Pretty sure the glycerin is just making my frizz worse. It looks no different than if I let my hair airdry without product. Thinking of using this up as a refresh product, especially since it doesn't leave any trace of a cast. Unfortunately, I'll be sticking to my non-AB foam.\n* **Lucido-L - Bouncy Waves Jelly (NRP)**  \nNot quite watery, but a more runny gel. Pretty sure the glycerin is just making my frizz worse - I'm left with big poofy hair at the end of the day. Hardly any hold to it. Fragrance is also way too strong. Disappointing as I was looking for a more liquidy gel to mix my non-AB hard hold protein gel with.\n\n**Fragrances**\n\n* **Nature Republic - Girl’s Flower (NRP)**  \nIt says the top notes are lemon, peach, orange, and apple, middle notes are jasmine and muguet, and base notes are amber, sandalwood, and musk. It's a bright scent. The top notes fade quite quickly, but the warm base stays for almost a full day, though you have to go close to smell it. When I first apply it, I have to be careful not to sniff it directly or I get a headache, but if I let it settle on my skin for a few minutes first, then I'm ok.\n* **Ohana Mahaalo - Leia Makalapua (NRP)**  \nIt says the blend is white amber, white musk, muguet. It's a muted scent, not strong or attention grabbing. My friend said it smelt almost commercial, like an affluent shopping mall. It lasts on my pulse points for quite some time, but I think it doesn't mix well with my sweat. So if I exercise, then it turns almost sour. If it's just a casual day in the office, it's fine.\n\nAlso tried common standards:\n\n* Oil Cleanser - Hada Labo - Hydrating Cleansing Oil (WRP)\n* Cleanser - COSRX - Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser (WRP)\n* Sunscreen - Missha - Aqua Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++ (WRP)\n* Lip - Rohto Mentholatum - Melty Cream Lip (Milk Vanilla and Matcha) (WRP)\n* Makeup… yeah… hahah\n\nFeel free to ask for more details, more comparisons (can compare with non-AB The Ordinary and others), or reviews on the other products.",

    "body": "There are 2 different and distinct formulas for this product marketed under the same name: the ‘Made in Japan’ Japanese version and the ‘Made in China’ SEA version. Not exactly sure exactly which countries sell the ‘Made in China’ version, but Google has confirmed it’s sold in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThe major difference is that the Japanese version contains Tranexamic Acid, Vit C derivative, and Vit E. The ‘Made in China’ version contains Niacinamide, alpha-Arbutin, Vitamin C, and Reservatol. Interestingly, the Japanese version also mentions nano hyaluronic acid while the ‘Made in China’ version does not.\n\nInterestingly, the SEA version that was ‘Made in China’ **did** feature the same ingredients as the Japanese version with TA. The only difference was where it was made (China vs Japan). This was reformulated sometime in 2022 (around June/July/August, if I remember correctly) to the current arbutin and niacinamide version.\n\n# ‘Made in Japan’ Japanese version:\n\n* **Images:**\n\n1. Bottle: [https://imgur.com/a/pdZkoMT](https://imgur.com/a/pdZkoMT)\n2. Refill pack: [https://imgur.com/a/VWfRDGl](https://imgur.com/a/VWfRDGl)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Description:**\n\nHada Labo Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion contains anti-inflammatory white tranexamic acid (whitening active ingredient), nanoized hyaluronic acid, vitamin C derivative and vitamin E as moisturizing ingredients.\n\nThe toner deeply penetrates the skin and repairs UV-damaged skin and prevents the formation of freckles and dark spots.\n\n• Reduce the production of melanin\n\n• Lightweight and gentle\n\n• Prevent hyperpigmentation\n\n• Repair damaged skin\n\n• Alcohol free\n\n• Suitable for normal skin type\n\n• Moisturizes the skin\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  **Ingredients:**\n\n<Active Ingredient> Tranexamic Acid (White Tranexamic Acid)\n\n<Other Ingredients> Vitamin C Phosphate Mg, Vitamin E, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (Nano Hyaluronic Acid), Na-2 Hyaluronic Acid, DPG, BG, Diglycerin, Concentrated Glycerin, soybean hydroxide phospholipid, PEG-8, PEG (30), POE (20) sorbitan laurate, VP / styrene copolymer emulsion, citric acid anhydride, paraben\n\n# ‘Made in China’ SEA version:\n\n* **Images:**\n\n1. Old formulation, bottle: [https://imgur.com/a/TxifRUF](https://imgur.com/a/TxifRUF)\n2. New/current formulation, bottle: [https://imgur.com/a/vUfqyqg](https://imgur.com/a/vUfqyqg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Description:**\n\nHada Labo's new upgraded formula combined Triple Brightening with moisturizing ingredients to deeply hydrate and rebalance skin tone, revealing a superbly even and translucent complexion.\n\nHydrates and prepares skin to reap the benefits from the skincare that follows. Skin pH balanced. Low irritation. Free of alcohol, fragrance, colorant and mineral oil.\n\nTRIPLE BRIGHTENING FORMULA\n\nNiacinamide, alpha-Arbutin and Vitamin C reawaken dull skin and even out skin tone for glowing, radiant skin.\n\n2 TYPES OF HYALURONIC ACID\n\nTwo types of Hyaluronic Acid provide intense, long-lasting hydration through every layer of skin.\n\nRESVERATROL\n\nEffective antioxidant from grapes protects skin from damage and keeps it healthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ingredients:**\n\nWater,Diglycerin,Niacinamide,Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol,PEG-400,Dipropylene Glycol,PPG-24 Glycereth-24,PEG-6,PEG-32,1,2-Hexanediol, Chlorphenesin,Carbomer,Polysorbate 20,Alpha-Arbutin, Triethanolamine,Styrene/VP Copolymer,Disodium EDTA, Laminaria Japonica Extract,Tocopherol,Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate,3-o-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid,Fucose,Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol,Sorbic Acid,Carnosine, Saccharide Hydrolysate,Maltodextrin\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Concluding thoughts**\n\nThe formulas are very different, making them basically 2 distinct products. I also did some broad research, and it seems like the lotions they sell to worldwide markets are the Japanese version *with* TA.\n\nI’m so curious to know why they reformulated it in their Chinese factory but kept the same formula for their Japanese factory. Would love to hear any thoughts and/or theories!",

I uploaded these pictures a long time ago, about 2 weeks after my first haul, with the idea that I would use the products for six months and then post reviews. Any swatches were also taken at that same time. Six months are up, so I hope my info will help you make better decisions for your skin, body and in turn, your bank account. I will give my thoughts on the product, then leave it a rating out of 5 on the general feel, price and finally, my personal rating (not reflective of the previous ratings). Every link is non-affiliate and I'm posting this on my own accord. The only product that won't be reviewed is the Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream Cotton Fit Samples, as they were a gift.\n\nAdmittedly, as I'm re-reading this I clearly see things I could have done to make this more coherent and easier for you all to understand, but it's a lot of writing and I learned as I went along. I felt like some gossip magazine columnist towards the end, so I'm 100% sorry if that's cringey or off-putting. If I do another review set in future, I hope it'll be better written.\nGoing in order from the photos:\n\n\n*SKIN CARE*\n\n\n**Mizon Original Skin Energy Hyaluronic Acid 100** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_dbe8149455.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-original-skin-energy-hyaluronic-acid-100-30ml.html?search=mizon%20100)\nThis feels similar to Hada Labo original but it's a super small bottle, only 30 ml compared to HL's 170 ml. Way longer ingredient list as well, but my skin swallowed it. It has ceramides and cholesterol, peptide, anti-inflammatory and -aging plant extracts, and adenosine as well as the titular hyaluronic acid (listed as sodium hyaluronate). On RRS it's listed at $10 USD, a 76% discount from $40 USD. I forgot about this when I bought a different hyaluronic acid serum and then pushed it back even more once I got Hada Labo. Turned to it last month when I felt like my skin just couldn't hold moisture, and I don't think I'll go back. It has not broken me out, and I use it right after my BHA/AHA.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>this feels so good to apply. I want to say it smells very, very faintly like some kind of butter/fatty oil? lmao it's not a bad smell at all, it's almost floral. The texture is super slippy and thin, again, like Hada Labo lotion. After application, my face is soft and smooth. It's like my face sucked the stuff into it within a minute.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$9.77 for 30 ml. for what this serum does, less than 10 bucks for 30 ml is an absolute steal. God bless RoseRoseShop.\n\npersonal rating: 5/5\n>I love it. So dearly, I love it. I'll definitely be repurchasing this once I buy from RRS again, and while I'm hesitant to call out holy grails, this is probably mine for moisturizing.\n\n----------\n\n**Tosowoong Syn-Ake Natural Pure Essence** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2dc0196695.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/tosowoong-syn-ake-natural-pure-essence-100ml.html)\nThis was good. It's main purpose seems to be anti-aging. Nothing I remember as truly remarkable, but that might be because I'm barely an adult and thus don't really have any fine lines to speak of. Funnily enough, I don't see anything resembling syn-ake in the ingredients. I still ended up buying this because it has a pretty good-looking formula, which it even touts on the box. Fourth ingredient is niacinamide, and other stars include two different ferments, peptide, centella extract, betaine, hyaluronic acid, and many berry extracts. Despite how unwowed I might seem, I ended up using this up within the 6 months I had it. I suspect it's effects are similar to my Missha FTE Intensive, as in lightened PIH, evened tone/less redness and general lack of irritation. It took a while to see these effects, but because this was used in conjunction with so many new products with brightening ingredients I'm not 100% sure it was the culprit.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Liquidy and clear, smells like nothing. Spreads like any other serum, no complaints here.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$11.80 for 100 ml.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>For me personally, it just doesn't do much. I don’t have any age reversal to see, and even if it did help with my skin tone, I have other products that I know for sure do that. All in all, it's a solid \"good\" from me. If anybody out there with more mature skin and/or fine lines has used this product, please let me know what it did for you!\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Intensive Skin Barrier Serum**\n[CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_38f5180403.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-intensive-skin-barrier-serum-50ml.html?search=Mizon%20Intensive%20Skin%20Barrier%20Serum)\nThis did nothing for me. When I ordered this haul, I had sickly dry winter skin and was desperate for moisture, so what better product than something with \"skin barrier\" right in the name? Turns out, this was hell in a pump. I didn't check the ingredients and was left with a serum that might as well have been smelly pimple slime. I had closed comedones all along my jaw and cheeks, my skin was dry again a few hours after application and the smell made me feel a little sick every time i used it. I've not experienced this with any other AB product. This is more of a testament to using CosDNA zealously than anything else. My bad. To my confusion, the first time I tried to use the pump applicator it wouldn't work. On the bottom of the container, there is a removable cap-looking thing with a notch on the edge that I used to pry it off and fiddle with the stopper that helped to push the product up. Only then was I able to use the pump.\n\nfeel: 2/5\n>Nothing special. Slightly opaque, classic serum consistency. The smell of this is citrusy and reminds me of cheap candles. I'm not one to mind fragrances, but it makes me feel like I need to drink a glass of water and lie down.\n\nprice: 2/5\n>$15.61 for 50 ml, list price is ~$25. Even discounting my personal experience with it, this serum is unimpressive for being one of the more expensive items in this haul. The major ingredients seem to be all filler with a few extracts and some HA tossed in as an afterthought.\n\npersonal rating: 1/5\n>Would not recommend. I have since chucked the bottle, I can’t even use it as a body treatment or hand cream it smells so bad.\n\n----------\n\n**Enprani Dear By Moistfull Booskin** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_0868211750.html) [Product Link](https://us.memebox.com/dear-by-moistfull-booskin)\nI don't really understand this product. It's a very acclaimed toner, which is why I bought it, and I do like it for days when I wear makeup but it puzzles me. My skin never felt dry after using it, but it never felt moisturized either. When I used this before serums, emulsions, creams, etc. it did help them to sink in faster, but over the day my skin felt slightly more parched than usual. I think this helped me to realize that I am really not a toner person. It's typical for me to skip that step most days now, but I do use this when I wear foundation or bb creams/cushions and it does help them wear longer. If you wear makeup often, I would definitely recommend this.\n\nfeel: 4/5\n>Water consistency but with a texture that's like less-stringy snail slime or joseon cream? Yes! Feels good to put on. The smell is strong, like flowery fabric softener. I'm told it's rose scented but I don't know what rose smells like. It dries down to what I would call a matte finish and feeling. Points lost for the eventual dryness and strong smell.\n\nprice: 4.5/5\n>List price now on Memebox is $20 for 120 ml, but I think I paid $18 for this? Regardless, I've used this toner for 6 months and I'm probably only down 20 ml. Worth the investment if it works for you.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>As far as toner goes, I think this will be my go-to forever for makeup prep. I love the smell and the feel, and if I didn't have combination skin, I think this would be perfect. I would recommend this to those with oily skin.\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f37d220631.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-snail-recovery-gel-cream-45ml.html)\nIt's okay, however I much prefer my Cosrx Snail Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence over this. It did help with my acne scars at the time and it's WAY cheaper than cosrx, so I would never be overly harsh on it. I notice some peptides and plant extracts at the bottom of the ingredients, so that's neat. I think this is a good cream for those who want to dip their toes in the pool of snail products without investment. This was my very first haul, after all, and this cream was my gateway to snail. I use this for my legs and other body parts and have nothing bad to say about it.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Cool and jello-y without the messy stringiness of pure snail. Slightly opaque with an earthly cosmetic smell. Dries like a dream.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$4.20 for 45 ml, a total steal.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>Overall, I just have a better snail cream that I prefer over this one. Would still repurchase this as a cheap snail body cream since it's a blessing for ingrown hairs.\n\n----------\n\n**OST C20 Original Pure Vitamin C20 Serum** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e7e3205117.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/o-s-t-c20-original-pure-vitamin-c20-serum-30ml.html?search=c20)\nThis stuff stung like a quick slap to the face every time I used it, but I'm told that's normal. It smells like sharp orange juice and is thick and sticky. It dries like that too, feels like a second skin and not in a good way. It oxidized super fast in the 4 month period that I used it. I stored it in a dark place and in fairly low temperatures. I did like the effects it left me with: a more uniform texture, lightened dark spots, a not-quite-oily-but-definitely-not-matte glow However, the hassle surrounding vit c is too much for me to deal with every day, especially for only 4 months of use.\n\nfeel: 2/5\n>Real, real gross. Very pungent citrus scent. On your skin, it feels kind of like what evaporated sea salt looks like if you feel me. I have to wipe off residue by applying my next step with a cotton pad.\n\nprice: 4/5\n>$11.23 for 30 ml. Not terrible, by far. I'm sure that if you use this serum very diligently you'll be able to use it up before it's the color of maple syrup.\n\npersonal rating: 3/5\n>It's okay. I know that vitamin c isn't supposed to be hydrating or even comfortable, but I feel like there are better, more stable formulas out there, and when people on the sub circlejerk about how unstable this stuff really is, they aren't kidding. If I were to try vitamin c again, I would not repurchase this product.\n\n\n*MAKEUP*\n\n\n**Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream Cover & Bright Fit in W02 Light Beige** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2571201744.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/etude-house-precious-mineral-bb-cream-cover-and-bright-fit-35g-spf30-pa.html?search=Etude%20House%20Precious%20Mineral%20BB%20Cream)\nAND\n**Holika Holika Nabi Cream SPF 25 PA++ in Cottony** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e6f1197705.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=60408&search=holika+nabi)\nTo be up front, I don't wear makeup very often and I have very little to compare this to. My skin's texture is fairly even, but I find my complexion is sallow with dots of PIH here and there, plus the discoloration of faint freckles. Have some [swatches](https://m.imgur.com/a/J0xdx) in artificial light, flash and natural light. Left to right is just primer, then just bb, then bb on top of primer blended out. \nThis will be a bit longer of a review. I used this in conjunction with the Holika Holika Nabi Cream, so I will group these together. I really like this bb cream and primer. They work well together, do not break me out and the color matches me nicely. It looks quite orange at first, but paired with the primer I feel it evens out to a pinky-peach shade. I do not understand undertones, I get very frustrated trying to figure them out for products and my own skin (I still understand heck-all about whether I'm cool, warm or soylent green). So, if anybody out there has this bb cream or would like to make an educated assumption based on the photos on what undertone it is, please let me know and I'll put it in bold.\n\nThe Etude House bb dries down to a semi-matte finish. It does not feel oily or overly-dry at first, however I do mist my face with a moisturizing toner as I like a more sheer look. Depending on how much you layer, you can get moderate to full coverage. However, I would not recommend more than two layers because you can get real cakey real quick. For reference, I always wear one light layer. I find that wearing this without a facial mist dries out my normal/oily combo skin, accentuating both dry and oily parts of my face. Again, this is a somewhat matte formula, so it’s dry by nature. It wears well for about 10 hours, which is when it starts to wear off a little patchy and become overly-shiny. I like this so much that I am looking to purchase the moist version cushion.\n\nThe Holika Holika primer is super nice. It's tinted purple, which gives a subtle brightening effect. The cream feels lightweight and smoothing, like a good primer should. While not feeling tacky, it still helps bb cream to adhere to the skin and last longer. I don't think I would recommend this to those with large pores since it seems to be more of a color correcting product and the smoothing and filling effect is minimal. The Nabi line has 3 shades: Cottony, Vitality and Shiny. Cottony is purple, Vitality is pink, and Shiny is beige. In the imgur album, I listed the one I have as Vitality since that's what I ordered, but now I'm pretty sure that I had Cottony all this time? I didn't think much of it at the time since I'm bad with color and I really liked the results I got with it. This may be the only mishap with RRS I've had to date, and it ended up being a gift since pink makes me look overly-red (EH Face Blur, I love you.... but why?).\n\nfeel: 4.5/5\n>The primer is excellent for what it does. I do not have enlarged pores, so it's really convenient for me to have a primer that acts as both a color corrector and makeup base without being heavy. Etude house makes my favorite bb creams, and it's nice to find a color that matches my semi-light, mystery-undertoned skin while wearing beautifully. The only complaint that I have is the slightly short wear-time and the dryness of the standalone cream. If you like matte/semi-matte products, I would recommend this because it's still a lot gentler than other matte foundations I've tried. Both of these smell like makeup, not overly perfumed or sickly but just kind of like setting powder.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$5.83 for 35g (bb cream) & $7.83 for 50g (primer). Super economical, and it's still amazing. I wear makeup sparingly, so these both will probably last me just under their full 12 month shelf lives.\n\npersonal rating: 4.5/5\n>I'm not one to settle on one product, especially with skincare, but I really feel no inclination to try out any other primers. Between this and my Etude House Face Blur, I'm all good. Would definitely repurchase. For the bb cream, I'll probably use this one all up before trying out its moist cushion type. I really love Etude House for makeup: really good formulas, my skin has no problems with it and all their products look really pretty. Would repurchase from the same brand/makeup line.\n\n----------\n\n**Etude House Dear Darling Tint in 01 Berry Red** [Product Link - Ingredients are not on CosDNA, but can be found in the \"Ingredients\" tab on its Memebox page](https://us.memebox.com/dear-darling-tint-01-berry-red)\nSkipping ahead a little here, but this is still makeup I suppose. I am kind of impartial to this line of tints. They are very pretty and stain well, but they don't last through me biting my lips and applying balm all the time. I am forever searching for one that will, but these do a good job for now. I own two of their tints now. Have [more swatches](http://i.imgur.com/d3r9zxe.jpg) with Berry Red on the left and Vampire Red on the right. The berry red smells sweet, like some kind of fruity candy. It wears well for about an hour before I've bitten or rubbed it off.\n\nfeel: 4/5\n>Smells amazing, decently pigmented and beautiful color. This is a gel type tint, and application can be streaky. The applicator and rim can also become very messy. Color probably lasts longer if you don't eat your lips throughout the day.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$6 for 4.5g. It does run out kind of fast, but for Memebox it's a solid price for the product amount.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>I like this, but I don't like having to reapply all the time. I'll probably keep looking for a tint that survives my lip biting and moisturizing habit. I recommend it to those who can generally leave their lips alone.\n\n\n*CLEANSING*\n\n\n**Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**[CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5319235682.html) [Product Link](https://us.memebox.com/low-ph-good-morning-gel-cleanser)\nI love this cleanser. It's my holy grail for body wash and my go-to for gentle wash after chemical peels. It's a perfect, simple gel cleanser. It does not strip my skin of moisture, it helps keeps my body blemish-free and it lasts for-damn-ever. Seriously, I use this every day and I only just ran out of my first bottle. It contains no sls, but it does of course still have other surfactants and \"sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\". I tend to follow [Fifty Shades of Snail's theory](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/08/23/review-tosowoong-enzyme-powder-wash/) on acidic cleansers and harsh surfactants anyway, and this cleanser clocks in at around 5.5 pH.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Like most low-pH cleansers, it leaves my skin feeling clean, but not dry. It smells noticeably like tea tree oil, (which is a scent I love very much so it scores even more points) and it lathers lightly using just your hands or moderately if you use a washcloth or exfoliating gloves. I use the body shop's brand of exfoliating gloves in conjunction with this, and my skin is always smooth and happily clear of any kind acne.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$10 for 150 ml. RoseRoseShop has it listed for $6.07 and Jolse for $8.80 at the time of writing this review. is gud price friend.\n\npersonal rating: 5/5\n>Holy Grail status achieved. I used to suffer from some pretty frequent breakouts on my back and butt (if you know me personally and are reading this just know that my butt is smooth as hell now, heck outta here) until I started using this cleanser, and now that I combine it with exfoliating gloves I have literally none of the problem spots or painful cysts that I'd been getting since puberty. I will forever continue to purchase this product and have bought 2 more bottles since running out of my first one a couple days ago.\n\n----------\n\n**Holika Holika Soda Pore Cleansing Cleansing Soda Water** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f87f134194.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=60172)\nThis palindrome of a product name belongs to my current eye makeup remover. I bought this product (as well as the Holika Holika primer) after seeing it in the routine of an AB/skincare youtuber named Elaine Mokk. Love her content and reviews despite it being less \"this works, here's why\" and more \"this was cute, it also happened to be a decent product this time\". Anyway, this cleansing water's main ingredients are water and alcohol. I suspect this is why I have problems with it. Not because I'm sensitive to alcohol, which I'm not, but because for me, the purpose of this product as an eye remover means that when it gets in my eye, it's a shitshow. It stings substantially and I end up rubbing my eyes like a madwoman trying to get it over with. I thought that maybe I was using too much product, and while using less made it more bearable and in most cases kept it from getting past my lashes and into my delicate corneas, the pump on this thing is a nightmare. No matter how gently and slowly you try to press the plunger top, you always press too hard and end up with a wet cotton round and a dry office-stare of contempt at the bottle. I thought that I would use this up to avoid being wasteful, but considering that I'm already worried about the integrity and health of my eyes, I think I'll be giving this away or selling it on ABExchange to somebody who would use it for the face instead. It's not bad at removing makeup, it's just not good for eyes.\n\nfeel: 1/5\n>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$6.63 for 150 ml. A great price if you can make it work for you.\n\npersonal rating: 2/5\n>I'm only giving it a 2 because it still removes makeup well. Otherwise, it's totally unenjoyable for what I wanted to use it for. Side note, I used this on my face to remove foundation a few times and found that it worked pretty good, about the same as my camellia and jojoba oil blend. I just don't see myself giving that up for this product, though.\n\n\n*MISCELLANEOUS*\n\n\n**Skinfood Argan Oil Silk Hair Mist**\nThis product apparently no longer exists. It's not on the site I bought it from, it's not on the skinfood website or CosDNA and if you google \"skinfood argan oil silk hair mist\" you get one defunct Skinfood US listing and literally 4 pictures on the images tab that show the product I have. I suppose the argan oil hair line has been reformulated and the mist fell under the radar or it was an exclusive. I'm betting on the former.\nLong story short, I have a love-hate relationship with this. When I bought it, I had no idea what was in it, what problems it claimed to target or what its reputation was. I've been doing no-poo since I was 15 years old and using 100% undiluted baking soda on my scalp, straight scooped out of the orange box and dumped it on my head until I wizened the hell up and used the rest of the time I spend on my hair up to this point doing damage control. Now that the hair that was once on top of my head is at the bottom, I've got basically straw for ends. I was in a state of denial about needing a haircut after not having had one for over 9 months and was looking for some help with fried ends and breakage. This mist is very nice. It smells very floral, if argan oil smells like what I think it smells like, then this smells like that. I remember one of the claims was that the main extract in the formula is broccoli extract. It also claims to have hydrolyzed silk. Whatever it was (and I know what it was), my hair looked amazing. It was sleek and kempt, no flyaways, the broken hairs around the crown of my head stayed down and my ends didn't look as much like a dollar store paintbrush. I used it often.  I took it upon myself to translate the ingredients on the back via google translate's draw feature, plugging in the hangul one at a time.\n\n>Purified water, Ethanol, Glycerin, PEG-Q150, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Polysorbate 20, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glutamic Acid, Dimethicone,\n\nI stopped at dimethicone, which is a big \"don't\" ingredient for my hair and the whole point of the no shampoo method. I like this mist a lot, but not enough to go back to conventional shampoo and conditioner. I’m also not sure if the effects of it were really as great as I thought they were or if it was all the reintroduction of silicone. Since the stuff is out of production anyway, I don’t think it matters. I’ll probably sell/give this away too.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Lightweight, smells great, helps with styling and general appearance.\n\nprice: 4/5\n>$6.43 for 145 ml, which is not bad but considering mists are supposed to be used liberally, you’d go through this fairly fast.\n\npersonal rating: 3/5\n>I’d use this product if it was friendly to my preferences. The ingredients don’t look impressive aside from hydrolyzed glycosaminoglycans, which is an amino sugar that supposedly promotes growth and extends the life cycle of hair. Maybe I’ll try it again and end up changing my routine to incorporate it just to see if it helps.\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Acence AC Care Solution Mark X Blemish After Cream** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_3050164581.html) [Product Link]( http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-acence-ac-care-solution-mark-x-blemish-after-cream-30ml.html)\nThis is an after-care cream that’s meant to be used on spots that have just been squeezed. That’s all I can gather from the little infographic that RoseRoseShop has. I used this on both blemishes that had been drained and ones that had not and I was surprised at how well this worked. My dark spots faded much quicker and after using it there were no recurrences of any of the pimples that I squeezed. It did not irritate my skin. This cream does leave a really waxy residue, though. The directions say to let it absorb into your skin, but it never fully does. Maybe that’s the way it’s supposed to be, but if you use it before bed it can get smeared on your pillow, face and hair. The ingredients are all very promising and effective, which I generally find is a theme for Mizon products. Let’s say a blemish takes 1 week to heal over completely; with this cream applied once every night, overnight, the time is shortened to around 4 days.\n\nfeel: 3/5\n>The effect of this product comes with a price: super waxy, oily film left behind. If you are sensitive to olive oil, try this at your own risk. At one point, I thought this cream was breaking me out, but I have used this many times after that and found that I was wrong.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$4.93 for a 30 ml tube.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>I like what it does for my trouble spots and can tolerate any greasiness that comes with it. I said I used it on both squeezed and closed spots, and I can definitely tell that it’s more effective on a drained area than one that still has gunk beneath the surface.\n\nThat’s it! If you have any questions, leave a comment and I’ll answer with any information that I have (^:",

    "body": "About a month ago, I picked up the Trader Joe's Nourish Oil-Free Antioxidant Moisturizer.  Note that TJ's also sells an intensive moisturizer, which contains oil.\n\nIt's a watery lotion that is light yet moisturizing.  If I apply too much, it feels annoyingly wet on my skin for about a minute until it dries.  After that, it is perfectly comfortable.  Since it's summer here, I don't need a heavy moisturizer.  I really like this and would definitely buy it again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/6AvUUKs)\n\nPros:\n\n* Inexpensive at 6 oz for $6\n* Contains a bunch of different antioxidants\n* Lightweight\n* Fragrance-free\n\nCons:\n\n* Antioxidant concentration might be low.  Many are listed after the preservatives.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just unknown.\n* Clear container might let light in, which might make the antioxidants less effective\n* Pump might not be super sturdy?  I knocked mine off my counter and the pump came off.   I was not able to get it back on, so I had to transfer the lotion to another container.\n\n\nIngredients:  Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate-60, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Cetearyl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Ethylhexyglycerin (Preservative), Shea Butter Fruit, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Xanthan Gum (Thickener), Tocopherol (Antioxidant), Sorbic Acid (preservative), Soluble Collagen, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C Palmitate), Pomegranate Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Coffea Arobica (Coffee) Seed, Chamomile Flower/Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Stearate, Phytonadione (Vitamin K1), Menadione (Vitamin K3), Hydrolyzed Silk, DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol), Copper PCA, Retinol (Vitamin A), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10),Thioctic Acid (Alpha-lipoic acid), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), Polysorbate-20, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Phospholipids\n\nPossible dupe?  [Skin Resource MD Oil Free Antioxidant Facial Moisturizer](https://skinresourcemd.com/collections/face-moisturizers/products/oil-free-facial-antioxidant-moisturizer#goto).  The packaging and ingredients look similar enough.  The ingredients are not listed 100% the same, but it seems that it would at least be very similar.\n\nI hadn't seen a review on this moisturizer here before, so I thought I'd write one.  Let me know if you also enjoy this product!",

Sorry the image isn't super aesthetic but I wanted to write the post asap!\n\n**About me:** 24F\n\n**Climate:** Between 35-39 degrees this summer, slightly humid but really dry most times.\n\n**Skin type:** My body's skin is dehydrated and always needs to be moisturised; however, even slightly heavy lotions make me sweat.\n\n**Texture of this lotion:** Looks like any regular lotion, bFraut when rubbed in it literally disappears into my skin in a good way. It spreads like a serum/water lotion.\n\n**Fragrance:** Light but pleasant scent, very similar to other Vaseline lotions. \n\n**Cost:** MRP 300\n\n**WRP/WNRP:** WRP\n\nIngredients list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Glutathione, Sodium Hyaluronate, Retinyl Palmitate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycine, Cystine, Sodium PCA, Petrolatum, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Perfume, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Coco-Glucoside, BHT, Benzoic Acid, Citric Acid, Potassium Hydroxide\n\n*Moisturisers I've already tried and mini reviews (note:* ***reviews are only for summers, otherwise I love all of these lotions and they work perfectly during winter***\\*):\\*\n\n* *Vaseline Aloe lotion* \\- Too light and not moisturising enough.\n* *Vaseline Restoring variant in the yellow bottle* \\- Makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Parachute Blue Bottle* \\- heavy and makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Vaseline Aloe Gel tube* \\- I really like this one for summer, gets absorbed super fast and gives a cooling feeling. However, I don't know if it helped with my dehydrated skin.\n* *Vaseline Daily Bright & Calming Body Serum -* I love this one. Though it's slightly less moisturising it's actually good for really hot and humid days.\n* I've also used the *Neutrogena hydro-boost gel* and *Cosrx All-in-one cream*s on my body because my face skin reacted badly to them - I honestly loved these for my body during summers because of how light but hydrating they are but obviously they're too expensive to be purchased to use on the body.\n* Lastly, I've tried to dilute every regular lotion with some water; *Minimalist 5% Niacinamide Lotion*, *Vaseline advanced repair* and one of the *Nivea dark blue bottle*s (all my HGs for winter). All of them still made me sweat after the water dried down.\n\nI have tried the *Vaseline Gluta-hya Serum-in-lotion* for about 1 week now and love it already!\n\nThis one looked like any other lotion but when applied, it literally turns into a watery serum consistency and gets absorbed by my skin within minutes. It doesn't feel heavy at all but moisturises very well for quite a few hours.\n\nI had to reapply on some really dry parts of my body within 4 hours but I'd take that any day over the sweaty feeling I get from using regular lotions in summer.\n\nIts scent is very similar to the Yellow Vaseline lotion however, it's slightly different and it's quite pleasant.\n\nIf anyone of you had used the Vaseline spray-on lotion/serum thing, this Gluta-hya thing is a more moisturising version of that product which is great because I also like the spray lotion despite it being slightly less moisturising.\n\nI don't know if it's really new in the market or if I've just found it but it's a good find!\n\nAlso, at the back of the tube, it says that this specific variant has *'Dual UV Filters'* i.e. UVA and UVB filters but obviously, I doubt if it's good enough protection, so I won't stop using my body sunscreen yet.\n\nThey also have another variant called [Dewy Radiance Serum-in-Lotion](https://www.myntra.com/body-lotion/vaseline/vaseline-non-sticky-gluta-hya-dewy-radiance-serum-in-lotion---200-ml/22580648/buy?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi46iBhDyARIsAE3nVrZg5uLe88lcJQxcHA5kivV2zWTXKHmiQ3ZT1v1Twhhmqj53tFr9twIaAu3lEALw_wcB) if anyone's interested!\n\nApologies if my format/writing isn't that great!",

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

The product website has the balls to hype it up as a good thing by stating:\n\n“With your ALTRENO lotion prescription there is no private or government insurance coverage, meaning you face fewer hassles. There are no copays, coupon cards, or need for reimbursement. You simply pay around $115 for your prescription, which lasts about 3 months.”\n\nOh my gosh no more of the hassle of my insurance helping to pay for my prescriptions!? All I have to do is fork over $115 quick as lightning? Thank you Altreno! /s\n\nOkay all joking aside. I know not everyone gets their retinoids covered by insurance. So if you’re paying out of pocket anyway, some ppl may choose to pay a little more for the better formulation. \n\nI’m gonna stick with my generic tretinoin cream. My copay on it is like 20 bucks or something.",

I had initially planned to write this review 2 weeks after using the latter, but I’ve had a below average experience in one week itself so I’d like to share my review in hopes of being of help to those who want to purchase it.\n\n*I have dry skin not prone to acne, have very little to no pigmentation and use Vitamin C as a preventive measure against ageing, sun damage and dullness. I live in an area with high UV levels and a very humid climate.*\n\n*My routine: Episoft Cleansing Lotion, Laneige Cream Skin Refiner: Toner & Moisturiser, Minimalist's Vitamin C Serum, Bello Photostable Emulgel SPF 40 (day) and Moskina Cream (night).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Texture Shot](https://preview.redd.it/35qouoy87q871.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9053ecf1c188f97b487b54a5a2b714b59a0a04cd)\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\nChemist At Play:\n\n>Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic acid, Propan-di-ol, Sodium Isomerate, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Ferulic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Oryza Sativa (Rice Phytoceramide), Amorphophallus (Konjac Phytoceramide), Hamamelis Virginiana, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMinimalist:\n\n>Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Glycerin, Sodium Gluconate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lecithin, Lactic Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/q0l52oub7q871.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=452589ce63e896b49a2bb5a08fbc6956ad6b9cf5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChemist At Play has Witch Hazel and Citric Acid; this may not be problematic for all, but if they are for you then keep this serum away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, Minimalist gave me the actual results a Vitamin C serum is supposed to give but Chemist At Play did the reverse. I'm just glad that it didn't give me any CC's or acne. I'm going to go ahead and reverse the dullness through Minimalist's serum. I'm better off using a ceramide infused moisturiser after my serum than have it in my serum in this case, which is a pity because if this serum had worked for me, it would've been an all-rounder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, everyone's skin is different and this is just one, hopefully helpful review.",

Even Huda advertised her skincare launch for WEEKS before she had the first product. I feel like of anyone, Huda would be able to launch a skincare brand day of and the product would sell out. Her and Beyoncé maybe. \n\nIf this new launch was such a big deal, it would have been one of the first products they advertised for premium. Like “hey! If you sign up for premium, you’ll be one of the first people to try this brand new brand! And we are going to educate you on it all month so you are super hyped to use it!”\n\nFinding a product on Alibaba with the exact same packaging and name for $2 is so sketchy... especially when you have 0 internet presence, if you were gonna fake people out like this in a smart way they would have made sure that as soon as you googled the product or company their website would show up first. Even fake a couple product reviews.\n\nI’m so confused about how this possibly happened. Like they’ve had weird brands like Illuminati sponges in their boxes before but no one cares about that because it’s just a cheap sponge. Not exciting,  but also no one is gonna look up their sponge to see the ingredients etc. because it’s just a sponge. It’s different with skincare. \n\nI saw someone on Instagram way “this should have gone in the base box” no... don’t do us dirty like that. How this ever made it in a box is very confusing.

Since I have acne-prone skin, the ingredient list scared me a little at first. The texture of the product is definitely very, very light, you don't even feel it on your face. The product is absorbed into the face very quickly, but after a while there is a slight oily feeling when you touch your skin. That's why I don't know if someone with very oily skin can like this product. I think that moisturizing is not enough for dry skin. When I started using Differin, I had to apply this product in several layers because differin dried out my skin, and I was still getting flaky places on my face. There are too many extracts on the ingredient list, some of which can cause fungal acne and clogged pores. \n\nAs a result, I think combination skins would like this product. If you have oily skin, I think you can use it in winter. Its performance under makeup, on the other hand, was not very good. That greasy feeling if you use a shiny bb cream or foundation, it reduces its concealing and creates an oily appearance rather than a glowy appearance. I don't think I will buy the product again. The size is 110ml and I think it's too big to finish in 6-12 months. I don't think it provides an extra benefit to my skin. It was an ordinary moisturizer for me. If you have also used it, please write down your reviews!!",

This essence has the highest concentration of the three offerings with 62.7% fig extract.\n\nI’ll be honest...by the time I had worked this essence into my routine the Fig Cleansing Balm and Fig Scrub Mask had already “failed” for me. Both of them were just a bit too heavy for my taste...either by being too abrasive or leaving behind a waxy residue.\n\nAnd the Fig Boosting Essence falls into that same category unfortunately. Rather than being a super thin/watery essence (like those from Missha or Secret Key) the goal here is more about rich hydration and nourishment and the consistency is ever-so-slightly thicker than water.\n\nWhile it totally delivers on that hit of hydration...I found there to be a slight oily feeling residue after patting in even one layer. It’s not something I really like during my essence stage and I had a similar issue with the Laneige Cream Skin.\n\nI could 100% see those with drier skin types or those that love heavier/more occlusive formulations to really get along with this product. I just dont think this range from I’m From is meant for me and I’ll be passing the rest of my bottle off to a friend.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Chlorella Vulgaris Extract, Glucose, Panthenol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Fructooligosaccharides, Fructose, Triethylhexanoin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Allantoin, Betaine Salicylate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Octanediol, Tocopherol \n\nWhere To Buy (Wishtrend - $35.00 USD - 150ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/fig-boosting-essence/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/fig-boosting-essence/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmeqcar4jxo51.jpg?width=4868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=080ea30b81a9fd01b57752b3a6ff6800c3875c7c",

    "body": "**Context for reviews:** I posted [a haul of mineral-based sunscreens](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1c8400r/mineralphysical_spf_haul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) a few weeks ago and wanted to share my thoughts so far! My goal this summer is to find at least one alternative to Dr. G (my HG, see below) since sometimes it's harder to find in stock, and the other goal is to find a water-resistant sunscreen, possibly mineral, that doesn't irritate my skin; this review post does not includeany water resistant products. Hope to post part 2 in a couple weeks after I can test more!\n\nMy skin seems to react better consistently to zinc oxide-based sunscreens for daily use. (Typically, not so good with titanium dioxide as the primary SPF ingredient, that has been drying for me.) I haven't totally ruled out all chemical sunscreens, though I've had reactions of irritation, break outs, flushing or burning with some chemical-based sunscreens (including the oh-so-lovely BOJ Rice + Probiotics, Skin1004 hyla-cica sun serum, HaruHaru Wonder airyfit, some Skin Aqua products). Mineral sunscreens also seem to help reduce shine/oil on t zone.\n\nI opt for products that are fragrance free (I find it distracting on my face but also some concern for irritation) and avoid or minimal use of essential oils. \n\n**Skin type:** Combination, acne-prone, sensitive, rosacea type 1. Mid 30s. Pale skin.\n\n\n\n**Climate:** \"Mediterranean\" according to google, extra hot and very dry spring/summers, mild winters.\n\n**Relevant routine notes:** I typically apply a daytime moisturizer under sunscreen and sometimes a serum, such as Aestura Hydro Soothing Cream and Cos De Baha Tranexamic Acid + Niacinamide Serum. I also double cleanse most nights using a cleansing balm and a water-based cleanser. I do try to reapply SPF every 2 hours in direct sun and before going out for walks during the workday. I don't often wear makeup beyond concealer.\n\n**Skin concerns:** barrier care, acne, redness, PIE\n\n---\n\n**KEY:** WRNP = Would Not Repurchase. MRP = Might Repurchase. WRP = Would/Will Repurchase. HG = Holy Grail/Multiple Repurchases/I Rely On This!\n\n*Note: All of these sunscreens contain butyloctyl salicylate, which seems to be generally considered an unregulated chemical sunscreen ingredient; some ingredient sites consider it an \"emollient\" and others a \"sunscreen booster.\" I don't seem to react negatively to this ingredient but I do consider it worth mentioning, given the various factors that many folks seek out mineral sunscreen options.*\n\n**Isntree - Hyaluronic Acid Natural Sun Cream** SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n**Ingredient list** (from Olive Young): Water, Zinc Oxide, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Isododecane, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Niacinamide, Caprylyl Methicone, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate (10 ppm), Betaine, Inositol, Panthenol\n\n**Use time:** about 1 week of daily use in springtime.\n\n**Overall Impression:** Creamy in texture and fairly moisturizing. It does have kind of an extreme white-cast. It takes a fair amount of rubbing in to reduce for me, it's a dedicated process, hah! I noticed it most around my nostril creases and uhhh my mini mustache. My partner who has a deeper skin tone found the white cast intolerable, TBH. That said, it has a decent pore blurring effect if you get it rubbed in enough, heh. I found it to be non-drying. I originally thought I could possibly skip moisturizing with this but I noticed some days when I didn't reapply in the PM, my forehead looked more dehydrated than usual. I think it's a dewy-ish finish. I didn't experience any irritation while using, so that's also good.\n\n**Rating:** WNRP as I think there are better options out there! I will use up what I have later this summer.\n\n**Torriden - DIVE IN Mild Suncream** SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n**Ingredient list (from Olive Young Global):** Water, Zinc Oxide, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Isododecane, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate, Dimethylsilanol Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Dimethylsilanol, Panthenol, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, 2,3-Butanediol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Malachite Extract\n\n**Use time:** about 2 weeks of mostly daily use in springtime\n\n**Overall:** I really enjoy this sunscreen! It's quite cosmetically elegant and I would say very very easy to apply. I do sort of apply in layers a bit. It is a slightly gel-creamy texture, the texture feels \"plump\" for lack of a better word. The white cast disappears much faster and with less rubbing in than most mineral sunscreens for me, though I have to be mindful of white cast along my hairline more than I'm used to and it takes longer when reapplying. It dries down fairly well, feels both moisturizing and hydrating somehow! My skin feels extra soft at the end of the day. I can use it interchangeably with my HG below, which for my sensitive skin is *saying somethin'.* I would say it's a more dewy or maybe satin finish. Extra plus, it comes in a cute narrow tube that is quite convenient in my packed purse!\n\n**Rating:** WRP for sure\n\n**Dr. G - Green Mild Up Sun+** SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n**Ingredients (from Olive Young Global):** Water, Zinc Oxide, Propanediol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Caprylyl Methicone, Isododecane, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Methyl Trimethicone, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, 7-Dehydrocholesterol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Ectoin, Buddleja Officinalis Flower Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\n**Use Time:** about 1 year with pretty regular use as a daily sunscreen, all seasons\n\n**Overall:** This is a slightly loose, more liquidy texture but not runny. It applies easily and dries down pretty quickly. There is a distinct white cast that for me disappears effectively once rubbed in and after it settles; it gives a nice pore blurring effect. I find this non-drying, non-irritating and reliable. I don't seem to notice white cast around my hairline, in comparison to Torriden, and find it easy to reapply. While it does have more plant extracts than I typically aim for, I've had no issues so I'll keep using! It's a bit plain -- which is great for sensitive skin, but I admit I find the Torriden just a bit more *fun* somehow. I do think it is the best matte finish with nice oil control.\n\n**Rating:** HG always want to have a backup at the ready\n\n  \nNext on my list: Biore UV Kids Pure Milk (water resistant - spoiler: didn't have a great start on day 1&2, broke out immediately), Biore BarrierMe (water resistant), Axis Y No Stress Physical Sunscreen, Benton Mineral we'll find out if I can tolerate rosemary oil. \n\nAny other suggestions to try? I've tried Haruharu's mineral SPF but wasn't a fan of the texture or white cast, and I've used the hybrid Skin Aqua Moisture Milk (seems to break me out, boo). \n\nThanks for reading! Let me know any questions! ",

I immediately thought I’d hate it - it’s runny and felt greasy upon application BUT I really like it! Gave it 10 minutes and it feels great - moisturized and slightly tacky (which I like) and 8 hours later it feels like it’s still there offering protection. I’m fair so I don’t have a great sense about white cast unfortunately, I don’t see one but that doesn’t mean much.",

        "body": "This is a great review. \n\nI would have to agree. Im fair skinned and Same skin type as you but living in a hot and cold seasonal climate (Canada) \n\nI was looking for a non drying mineral sunscreen as I’ve been recently dealing with rosacea that suddenly walked into my life when I got skin damage from UV \n\nInstree - I tried the physical one. I found it cosmetically beautiful . Never saw my pores. But definitely the slightest white tint since my eyebrows went a shade lighter lol. Dries matte. dunno if I have a hyaluronic sensitivity from my damaged skin barrier but I found as the day wore on it was VERY drying. I did use it to almost full bottle but prolly will not repurchase \n\nBiore kids UV pure milk - used for a week. While moisturizing left me shiny and oily looking. Now I give it to my 2 year old lol. Since they always need extra protection. I would still use this in a clutch cuz I believe it’s more water resistant and good for those pool days (when you look gross and sweaty anyways) \n\nColorescience no show mineral - I got a sample of this from my esthetician. While it went on great, inbetween dewy and matte, I swear it’s pilling. Especially when I wear a mask all day at work. Still testing this with different moisturizer in day to see if that was the issue. \n\nI was still on the hunt for a sunscreen I could tolerate. I will definitely try dr G. It felt great on my hand so now big test onto the face….\n \n\n\n- another side comment. Sorry if this is making my post extra long. Even tho I cannot tolerate chemical sunscreens. Oddly enough my HG was la Roche Possay melt in sunscreen. It was a titanium dioxide sunscreen hybrid. I ONLY used it for hikes and pool days. Never burned. Which makes me want to research more hybrid sunscreens. Have you tried any?",

I had 6 rounds of antifungals prescribed and it came back every single time.\n\nIf you struggle with sensitive, reactive, or fungal acne-prone skin, I’d love for you to check it out. Our Clear Balance Trio is a 3 step system designed to:\n\n* Repair your skin barrier\n* Balance oil and sebum production\n* Soothe inflammation without triggering breakouts\n* 100% free of oils, esters, polysorbates, ferments, fatty acids, dyes, fragrances, sulfates, parabens, silicone, drying alcohols, phthalates, and cruelty\n\n**Use code HELLO10 for 10% off your first order.**  It is based on Korean skincare philosophy of not just treating the symptoms but healing at the source.  As a new brand I am only shipping within the US at the moment but hope to be international very soon!\n\nThanks for all the encouragement and support. It means the world. 💚 Here for any and all questions!\n\n  \n**UPDATE**: For all my dry skin sufferers!  Skynbio obviously uses no Malassezia triggering oils.  It instead uses humectants meant to draw moisture into the skin (glycerin, sodium hyaluronate, and urea).  **Our chemists recommended applying our serum and moisturizer to slightly damp skin that has been misted or wetted.**  This makes the skin more permeable but also provides surface water for the humectants to draw moisture into the skin.  It can increase the effectiveness up to 50%!",

So far napansin din ng kapatid ko gumanda skin ko even after matagal na yung last consultation ko. I was just using the moisturizer and sinscreen back then. Can’t entirely say sure, pero so far ito palang di ako nagbreak out kaya tinuloy ko 😅",

    "body": "Hi, all! I originally had this posted over in the main sub, but I'm reposting it here! Below is my running list of products without hyaluronic acid and its derivatives and this particular list is strictly AB. \n\n**Please let me know if you have any products to add or if I have anything wrongly categorized!** I will also keep updating this post as I continue to find more HA-free products. \n\n* * * \n\nThe lovely u/RandomPerson987123 also took the liberty of putting this list into a Google spreadsheet! Below is their original comment copy and pasted as they've explained everything so precisely. \n\n\"Hi everyone. I took the liberty of putting this into a Google spreadsheet. I included sections for the link to the CosDNA and makers website, it counts the number of ceramides in a product and identifies whether it contains niacinamide, silicones, alcohols, butylene or propylene glycol. There's also a column where you can enter your own ingredient name and it'll search the ingredients list for it (helpful if you're sensitive to other ingredients). You can sort by product type, brand, yes/nos, etc.\n\nLink: [Google Docs No HA Product List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-JAht44PfvkHAClFC7eJo4XLhn72RJqis_uQNDukWac/edit#gid=0)\n\nI also made a survey in which you can request something be added deleted or corrected, which can be found here: [HA Spreadsheet Change Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYegDjX1PWF4pFIP5e5f7B0mH7CBuBg42myQ1KT9i8VF26fA/viewform). (The credit for that idea goes to u/foir and the sunscreen thread).\"\n\n* * *\n\nItalicized products are ones that I have used (or currently use) and can provide a review for. I did not include any products I've tried but broke out from due to a different ingredient sensitivity. \n\n**If I mistakenly included any product(s) that DOES contain hyaluronic acid or sodium hyaluronate, please let me know!** I tried my best to double/triple check ingredients lists, but it's possible a few slipped through the cracks! Also, if any product has since been reformulated or discontinued, let me know and I will make note of it!\n______________\n\n**Cleansers**\n\n* Acwell Bubble Free pH Balancing Cleanser\n\n* Banila Co Clean It Zero (Classic; Purity; Radiance)\n\n* Benton Honest Cleansing Foam\n\n* *Botanic Farm Grain Ferment Cleansing Sherbet*\n\n* Ciracle Anti-Blemish Tea Tree Face Wash\n\n* Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Cleanser\n\n* Curel Foaming Wash\n\n* *DHC Deep Cleansing Oil*\n\n* *Dr. Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Water*\n\n* Heimish All Clean Balm\n\n* Holika Holika Smooth Egg Peeling Foam\n\n* *Illi Total Aging Care Cleansing Oil*\n\n* Innisfree Apple Juicy Cleansing Oil\n\n* Innisfree Apple Juicy Cleansing Foam\n\n* Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing 5.5 Cleanser\n\n* Innisfree Calming Gel Cleanser\n\n* Innisfree Green Tea Cleansing Water\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam\n\n* It’s Skin Mangowhite Cleansing Foam\n\n* Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil\n\n* Labiotte Chateau Wine Sherbet Cleanser\n\n* Labiotte Total Recovery Foam Cleanser\n\n* May Coop White Water Cleanser\n\n* Missha Near Skin pH Balancing Cleansing Foam\n\n* Missha Near Skin pH Balancing Cleansing Oil\n\n* Missha Super Aqua Pore Correcting Cleansing Foam\n\n* Missha Super Aqua Refreshing Cleansing Foam\n\n* Nature Republic Snail Solution Foam Cleanser\n\n* Nooni Root Energy Cleansing Water\n\n* Nooni Snowflake Cleanser \n\n* Nooni Snowflake Whipping Cleanser \n\n* Oolu Ginseng Cleansing Foam\n\n* Papa Recipe Trouble AC Foam Cleanser\n\n* Papa Recipe White Flower Clear Up Powder Cleanser\n\n* Re:cipe Slowganic Cleanser (Adlay; Green Tea; Lemon)\n\n* Scinic Honey Banana Cleansing Foam \n\n* SKINFOOD Egg White Pore Foam \n\n* SKINFOOD Tea Tree Fresh Cleansing Foam\n\n* Skinmiso Rice Cleansing Foam\n\n* Stratia Velvet Cleansing Milk\n\n* SU:M37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick\n\n* Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Cleansing Foam\n\n* Tatcha Polished Classic Rice Enzyme Powder \n\n* *Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash*\n\n* Whamisa Organic Flowers Creamy Foam Cleanser\n\n**pH Adjusting Toners**\n\n* Cosrx AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner\n\n* Mizon AHA & BHA Daily Clean Toner\n\n**Actives**\n\n* DHC Salicylic Face Milk (Salicylic Acid 2%)\n\n* *Rohto Melano CC Essence* (Ascorbic Acid)\n\n* Sidmool AHA 10 Brightening Smooth Toner (Glycolic Acid 5% Lactic Acid 5%)\n\n* Sidmool Dr. Troub Skin Skin Returning Milk Peel (Lactic Acid 20%)\n\n**FTEs/Hydrating Toners/Mists**\n\n* 9Wishes Rice 72% White Lucent Toner\n\n* A’pieu Madecassoside Fluid\n\n* *Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner*\n\n* Ariul Spa Water 24h Moisturizing Refreshing Mist\n\n* Aromatica Lavender Relaxing Toner\n\n* Aromatica Orange Blossom Toner\n\n* Aromatica Rosemary Refresh Toner\n\n* Banila Co.

    "body": "A quick review right before I shower HAHAHA.\n\nInfo:\nI have combination skin leaning towards oily. My skin is acne and clog prone and I do have some KP on my bottom cheeks/jaws. My skin is also a sensitive and moody chicken if anyone’s wondering so I’m super picky about the products I use. \n\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM: Splash with water -> Vanicream daily facial moisturiser -> some sunscreen sample lol\nPM: Dokdo cleanser -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline\n\n\nThis cleanser had a very creamy and sticky texture. It foams a little when you rub your hands together with water. As the whole line is targeted towards sensitive skin, it is a very gentle cleanser.\n\n\nThoughts:\n\nOkay I actually didn’t really expect much from this product when I first used it. It was a huge impulse buy and I actually regretted buying it. Prior to using this cleanser, I was using the Rovectin Conditioning Cleanser and let’s just say that it was one big roller coaster haha. I switched over to this cleanser in hopes to save my skin and also because it was just collecting dust on my desk lol.\n\nThe texture is sooooo fun to play with. Even though it’s creamy, it’s also rather sticky. It’s nothing like the other cleansers I’ve tried before. It doesn’t foam up too much so my skin doesn’t feel stripped.\n\nWhile it doesn’t have any added fragrances, it does have a smell. Personally to me it smells like someone threw up in it, but some people say it smells herbal like or plastic like or mineral like. Yeah lots of different smells LOL. I thought I had bought a fake so I went and bought another cleanser (travel version) from the official store and it smells the same so rip ;-;. \n\nIt’s a no nonsense kind of cleanser, does what it needs to do and does it well. It doesn’t remove makeup that well because it’s quite gentle, so you might need a first cleanser for that. For sunscreen it depends, but I’ve heard some people just cleanse their face twice with the cleanser just to be safe. \n\nCompared to the previous cleanser I used, this one was so nice to use. It made me feel so excited to shower LOL. I didn’t get any reactions from this and in fact, some of my CCs and pimples actually went down when I started using this. \n\nIs this HG? I guess it is. I’m genuinely hesitant to call something a HG because I’m scared that my skin will go no u on me. But I guess at this moment? It is close to being one. I bought mine off of SHOPEE and it cost about SGD$18-$20+ with discount. I think the original price is about $30? I might actually repurchase this once I’m done HAHAHA.  9/10\n\nRoundlab is also well known for their Dokdo toner and I’m really tempted to try it LOL. But I have my pyunkangyul essence toner coming in soon for me to try so ummmm one day one day. My friend actually bought it and said that it’s such a good toner.",

    "body": "Hello everyone. I, 23 (M), have been living with IC for 3 years now. I've never met anyone in person with it but if i did I would give them (and you all) a massive hug, because this is not how people should be living, its just not fair. \n\nAs I'm sure the same with all of you, I have been doing extensive research, seen specialists, tried every possible drug or supplement and other lifestyle changes in hope of getting some improvement. I just wanted to give an account of whats worked for me, for anyone that is new to this, is still struggling with it, or a has loved one with it in general.\n\nFirstly, I know its hard, but please try not to catastrophise! When I was first diagnosed, I came onto this subreddit and saw tons of people saying pessimistic things like; there is no cure, it gets progressively worse as you age, people with this should have the right to euthanasia...which I understand why someone may feel this way, but it does not have to be like this! Modern medicine and our understanding of painful conditions has come a long long away, even in the past 3 years. So anyone who has this should definitely look into the following if they haven't already. \n\nI acknowledge the diverse and complex nature of IC causes, symptoms and treatments - especially between males and females. But these should be objectively solid empirically backed solutions to look into: (note; these are long-term treatments intended to treat and manage IC - not ones for the immediate relief of pain from flare ups, although this subreddit has plenty of good suggestions for that)\n\n\\- Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyacyst) *bladder installations* (pretty standard treatment) I’ve had this 6 times now and they improved my condition greatly. \n\n\\- Pentosan polysulfate (elmiron, also aims to rebuild GAG layer)\n\n\\- Low-dose Naltrexone (LDN - novel anti-inflammatory) = very very promising in pre-clinical trials and anecdotal accounts. works with other inflammatory condition like endometriosis and PCOS.\n\n\\- low-dose Amitriptyline (tricyclic antidepressant) for nerve related IC pain.\n\n\\- Histamine Blockers/ Mast-cell stabilisers (reduces bladder inflammation related to mast cell activation)\n\n\\-Alpha blockers (help with urethral burning and pain by relaxing the smooth muscles in the bladder neck)\n\n\\- Gabapentin, Pregabalin (also for nerve related IC, but should be the last resort due to side effects)\n\n\\- SSRIs + SNRIs (anxiety/ overactive CNS related IC) \n\n\\- pelvic floor physio, specifically for less GAG layer related IC and more tight pelvic floor muscles \n\n\\*\\*Hypermobilty is also very much associated with IC, especially in women. Pilates is great for this and also for strengthening your pelvic floor muscles. \n\nLastly. I work in a lab that uses stem cells to treat neurological injury, what we can achieve with this amazing technique is incredible. While it is a neuroscience lab, I have been theoretically investigating the potential for stem cell therapy for IC, as a means to regenerate the GAG layer. Upon talking to my higher-ups and my colleagues, commercial stem cell treatments for IC is unfortunately still a few years away but once this is a reality, we are looking at a potential cure for IC!!! and yes I know how incredibly expensive and inaccessible stem cell therapy is in some countries at the moment. But it is unlikely to stay this way forever - especially as it makes its way into mainstream medicine in the future. plus as such clinical interventions are approved, insurance companies will also start to to cover things like this - especially in extremely severe cases. \n\nIf you are reading this, please do not think it will be like this forever. In the beginning, I genuinely thought my life was over, but these medications and therapies have helped me in ways I couldn’t have imagined. What gives me even more hope is the regenerative nature of the body—old, damaged cells die, and new ones are constantly forming. The bladder lining has some ability to repair itself over time, especially with the help of treatments like bladder installations or Elmiron, and calming inflammation with medications like LDN or antihistamines can create the conditions for healing.\n\nFrom my degree and job in neuroscience, I’ve come to understand that the nervous system is also incredibly adaptive. Over time, with the right support, overactive pain signals can be “retrained” or dampened by medications like amitriptyline, gabapentin, or even techniques like pelvic floor therapy. While IC may not fully disappear, your body has the ability to adapt and improve, leading to better days ahead. So, do not fret too much—there is hope. Stay positive, be kind to yourself, and give yourself credit for enduring what most people could never. You are strong, and better days are coming. Xx\n\n  Ps, if you have any questions about any of the treatments - I’m happy to chat, just Dm me! \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Great for heartburn and acid reflux as well. \n\nAloe Vera Softgels - I take these daily in the mornings, they've helped keep everything functioning and ease/prevent flare-ups. Work best with regular usage.  \n\nAnd...for those who may not be aware (I certainly wasn't)...have yourself tested for food dye allergies. 😑 They can be exacerbating your IC unknowingly. \n\nBeing allergic to Red 40 and not knowing caused a lot of heartache, especially when I found out most of the water flavorings I was using to promote better water intake had Red 40 dye in them. \n\nAzo and the prescription equivalent also contain Red 40, named as Allura Red or E129.\n\nHope this information is helpful to someone else!",

In the meantime, I'll add my trick that I picked up from someone else in this sub. \n\nI drink 80-120ml of water a day, and put a teaspoon of baking soda and a pinch of mineral salt in my water (I only drink distilled and reverse osmosis filtered). Baking soda is known to be antiinflammatory and I find it helps to have it in small amounts daily. It also adjusts the ph of the water, which is a trigger for me and many others. There is such a thing as too much, so be weary of that. The mineral salt also helps me get minerals that are vital to your day to day, so it's a win win. Also in my opinion it makes the water taste better, especially distilled.",

Other foods that are safer than others but may still flare are: rice, sweet potato, egg, chicken, beef, pork. It is always safest to cook the meal yourself so you know you are getting no added seasoning.\n\nIf you flare from intimacy or suffer from pain after urination more so than during, then that is highly suggestive of pelvic floor involvement. \n\n**TREATMENT**\n\nCommon, simple, and effective treatments for IC are: Pelvic floor physical therapy, amitriptyline, vaginally administered valium (usually compounded), antihistamines (hydroxyzine, zyrtec, famotidine, benedryl), and urinary antiseptics like phenazopyridine. \n\nPelvic floor physical therapy has the highest evidence grade rating and should be tried before more invasive options like instillations or botox. If your doctor does not offer you the option to try these simple treatments or railroads you without allowing you to participate in decision making then you need to find a different one.\n\nLong-term oral antibiotic administration [should not be offered](https://www.ichelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AUA-IC-Guideline-2022.pdf).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "body": "Hello! This automated message was triggered by some keywords in your post that suggests you may have a diagnostic or treatment related question. Since we see many repeated questions we wanted to cover the basics in an automod reply in case no one responds.\n\n**To advocate for yourself**, it is highly suggested that you become familiar with the official [2022 American Urological Association's Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines]( https://www.ichelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AUA-IC-Guideline-2022.pdf).\n\n[The ICA has a fantastic FAQ](https://www.ichelp.org/understanding-ic/learn-about-ic/frequently-asked-questions/) that will answer many questions about IC.\n\n**FLARES**\n\n[The Interstitial Cystitis Association has a helpful guide for managing flares](https://www.ichelp.org/understanding-ic/learn-about-ic/ic-flares/).\n\n**Some things that can cause flares are:** Medications, seasoning, food, drinks (including types of water depending on PH and additives), spring time, intimacy, and scented soaps/detergents. \n\nNot everyone is affected by diet, but for those that are oatmeal is considered a generally safe food for starting an elimination diet with. Other foods that are safer than others but may still flare are: rice, sweet potato, egg, chicken, beef, pork. It is always safest to cook the meal yourself so you know you are getting no added seasoning.\n\nIf you flare from intimacy or suffer from pain after urination more so than during, then that is highly suggestive of pelvic floor involvement. \n\n**TREATMENT**\n\nCommon, simple, and effective treatments for IC are: Pelvic floor physical therapy, amitriptyline, vaginally administered valium (usually compounded), antihistamines (hydroxyzine, zyrtec, famotidine, benedryl), and urinary antiseptics like phenazopyridine. \n\nPelvic floor physical therapy has the highest evidence grade rating and should be tried before more invasive options like instillations or botox. If your doctor does not offer you the option to try these simple treatments or railroads you without allowing you to participate in decision making then you need to find a different one.\n\nLong-term oral antibiotic administration [should not be offered](https://www.ichelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AUA-IC-Guideline-2022.pdf).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body": "Hey all!! I had posted not too long ago requesting help finding a dupe for my now discontinued lip balm, the Bite Agave Lip Mask. I took recommendations and compromised on some of my wishlist for ingredients, as I realized no one else makes a balm with an identical ingredient list. I figured in case anyone else is struggling with replacing this, I'd share what I found. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It too got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. Its good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. Its a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. Its a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, its going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!!",

I really like this set because it makes it easy to carry around for overnight stays or on the plane.\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol Denat., PEG/PPG017/6 Copolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract , Cymbopogon Citratus Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Tricholoma Matsutake Extract, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract , Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Saururus Chinensis Leaf/Root Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Bark Extract, Coptis Chinensis Root Extract , PEG-60 Hydrogenated Cator Oil, Carbomer, Tartaric Acid , Glycolic Acid , Lactic Acid , Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Benzophenone-5, CI 19140, CI 17200, Fragrance\n* **Product smell, texture & finish**: It smells like lemon, which is really off putting as I've had lemon = bad drilled into my head. It leaves a sticky finish but you have to wash it off. \n* **Product effects compared to claims**: Claims - \"this product provides gentle yet effective exfoliation of dead skin cells and impurities, leaving skin smoother and clear.\" Sure, I guess? It's gentle, but I didn't think it left it particularly smoother than any of my regular acid products.\n* **Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products**: I use it as my acid step after cleansing, but it's a wash off acid, so you have to bear that in mind.\n* **How long it has been used for**: I've used two pads so far.\n* **Has it been/will it be repurchased**: Has not been repurchased, and will not be repurchased.\n* **Concluding remarks**: I like them well enough and I'm glad I got to try it because those tubs have been super inviting, and I've been lemming HARD. But honestly it just hasn't wowed me to make me want to use it often. Especially as I have to wash it off, which is like, WHY. This is effort, I don't see a huge change and compared to the Innisfree Green Barley Peeling Pad, it's pretty meh. What I will say is that you can use it as a body pad just before a shower which is actually not bad because it is mega mega soaked in product.\n \n\nIf there are other points you think should be included in the template or removed, please let us know. \n\n--- \n#Help Threads, Asking for Advice & The Wiki \nFor the foreseeable future we will not have help threads. The daily threads are discussion threads, not help threads, so while advice has been freely given we want to make it very clear that **no member of the community is obligated to give advice or help anyone**. Every discussion topic should feel like a slumber party where you're talking stuff out with your friends. Advice should be part of an organic discussion. \n \nInstead of, “I'm NW15, should I buy The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13?”\n \nTry, “It's summer and I've seen a lot of cooling cushions around that make me really curious. Do they work? I have no idea! I read this review that said they do and this one that says they don't. My NW15 skin thinks they're a gimmick, but I'm tempted to get this The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13 I found on Peony Peony Store. Anyone tried any cooling products from this line?”\n\nPlease remember, if you can easily do an internet search for the answer, you should do so, not expect anyone else to do it for you.\n\nAs r/AsianBeautyAdvice have awesome plans for a wiki, we will not be curating one in the traditional sense.  \n \n--- \n#Other Points:\n\n**Flairs**\n\nThere is also no need for post flairs as everything should be a discussion! \n\nOther than no self promotion (ie no link to your blog/external platform) we have no restrictions on personal flairs. Skin type, location and skin tone are common flair content, but you can also have fun with it as long as it isn’t offensive.\n \nAn example of suitable flairs would be:\n \n* Snail enthusiast\n* Dry/Sensitive Skin | Australia\n* NW20 | Passionate about AB makeup!\n* Tony Moly Banana Pack needs more love\n \n\n**Blogger, Businesses & External Content Creators:**\n\nNo shameless self promotion and no stand alone threads centered around your content.

    "body": "\nSkin Type: Extremely Oily and Acne Prone\n\nWeather: Hot and dry\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nUsage Period: 3 months \n\nActive ingredients: \n\n* 3% tranexamic acid \n* 1% HPA (hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid)\n*  3% mandelic acid \n* 0.3% salicylic acid\n\nAll ingredients: aqua, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, tranexamic acid, dimethyl isosorbide, mandelic acid, pentylene glycol, methylpropanediol, acetyl glucosamine, hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid, sodium polyglutamate, sodium hyaluronate, ethoxydiglycol, salicylic acid, xanthan gum, lecithin, phenoxyethanol, sclerotium gum, pullulan, ethylhexylglycerin, curcuma longa (turmeric) root extract, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate.\n\nTexture: it is liquidy but not runny, and it has a yellow colour due to presence of turmeric.\n\nReview\n\nThis product is the most favourite part of my skincare because when I apply the serum at night, it always lives up to my expectation of waking up with a clean shiny skin next morning. \n\nWhen I first started using the product, I built up tolerance by starting once a week, then twice, then thrice and gradually everyday (except on the nights I use a AHA BHA Peel)\n\nI love the formulation of this serum the most because it honestly has everything which an oily, acne prone skin needs.\nMadelic acid is a really gentle exfoliant and since the serum has the same amt of Mandelic acid as Tranexamic which we can call it a gentle exfoliating serum too. It also a tiny amt salicylic acid which makes it an all rounder for my routine. \n\nI’ve been using the serum along with 2% granactive Retinod from Be Minimalist.\nI apply the Tranexamic acid serum, wait for a couple of minutes for it to sink it, and layer it with a pea size of Granactive Retinoid. This has been advised to me by the Be Minimalist team. I top it up with moisturiser. I’m the happiest when I wake up to smoother skin.\n\nOne thing I don’t understand is no matter how flawless my skin looks in the morning, it becomes a little bumpy, oily, filled with CCs by the end of the day. Does this happen to y’all too?\n\nI’ve definitely seen a reduction in hyperpigmentation and acne with this routine and especially the Tranexamic acid serum over past 3 months but I’ve been battling with greasy oily skin at the end of the day and formation of small CCs which go away in the morning. The Tranexamic acid serum fades my new acne marks a lot quicker than the amount of time it took me earlier to get rid of a scar. \nAlso, I didn’t take sunscreen seriously earlier and had grown a shade darker than my original skintone, with use of this, I’ve been back to my original skintone. \nI had this little small visible black heads on my cheeks which have faded too over past 2-3 months. \nI will definitely repurchase the serum. \n\nMy routine \nAM: \n- Pulp Vit C serum\n- Sepicalm moisturiser (sometimes)\n- Neutrogena Sheer Zinc sunscreen\n(It has white cast but it’s the only one that suits me and doesn’t irritate me or cause breakouts, idc about the white cast much because most of times I’m at home and when I’m out I wear a mask)\n\nPM:\n- Double Cleansing with\n* The Face Shop Rice cleansing oil\n* Bioderma Sebum Cleanser\n- Cosrx Snail Mucin \n(I usually go for a walk or run and come back sweaty so I splash my face with plain water and do my night routine at 11)\n- Tranexamic acid serum\n- Granactive Retinoid \n- Sepicalm Moisturiser from Be Minimalist",

        "body": "Oh, this is the first I'm noticing the mandelic acid in there! This is an exfoliating serum! 🤔 Thanks for the thorough review, OP ❤\n\nAs for your developing CCs by the end of the day - the Sepicalm moisturiser might be too heavy for you to use in the AM, but more than that, I suspect you're over-exfoliating 😅 The vitamin C in the morning, AFAIK, is an L-ascorbic one, so that's acidic, and causes some mild exfoliation. The TxA serum at night is exfoliation. Then on top of that, you do the AHA-BHA peel as well? *Plus*, getting used to a retinoid already compromises barrier function. \n\nIt's a *lot* of exfoliation, combined. You may not be peeling, but it causes that shiny-plasticky look, and makes skin more vulnerable to acne bacteria and fungal acne and general infections. \n\nLuckily, people with oily skin have a bit more of a natural barrier function. I'd say maybe stop using the peel, and dial back using the TxA serum to alternate days, and you should see your skin become more balanced. Give your skin some time to function between actives.\n\nEdit: the Minimalist team and their website have terrible suggestions for how often to use their products, don't go by that!",

    "body": "Evenprime Daily Moisturizer\n\nWhen I think about what I want in the perfect daily moisturizer things like long-lasting hydration, soothing, nourishment, and brightening come to mind. Luckily, I have found a couple great products this year including the Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer and Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion.\n\nAnd, I’m happy to say I’ve found another awesome option with the Evenprime Daily Moisturizer.\n\nThis ingredient packed lotion features niacinamide, panthenol, allantoin, sunflower seed oil, chamomile, licorice root, madecassoside, ferment filtrate, and several forms of hyaluronic acid...essentially covering all of my bases.\n\nIn addition, the lightweight gel/cream contains knotweed, mushroom extracts, and soybean seed extract to add a boost of antioxidant and anti-irritation properties. Seriously, this is one of the most well-formulated and impressive ingredients lists I have seen in a single product.\n\nBringing things home...the Evenprime Daily Moisturizer absorbs incredibly quickly without leaving behind a film, residue, or heavy feeling making it perfect for my oily/combination/changes every day skin. \n\nOver time I have really appreciated how this moisturizer helps to calm my skin, provide a decent amount of hydration, and even enhanced the brightening effects of my exfoliation/essence steps. I honestly cannot get enough of this product!\n\nBut, now that the cooler weather is upon us alongside the dryness in the air (hello Colorado)...I’ve found myself looking for a bit more in the way of emollient “moisture locking” products. The Evenprime Daily Moisturizer hasn’t provided quite enough recently, especially for my pm routine.\n\nWhile I have been able to work around this by incorporating the Solved Skincare Jojoba Oil Serum into the mix (3 drops in the am and 6 in the pm), I could see those with particularly dry skin looking for more. \n\nThe Evenprime Daily Moisturizer is still an incredible product that I think just about anyone could see some benefit from...and rumor has it there might be a heavier version in the works! But for now, I’ll be continuing to add an extra boost and then reaching for something more rich in the coming months.\n\nFull Ingredients List: WATER (AQUA), GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, POLYGLYCERYL-3 METHYLGLUCOSE DISTEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SORBITAN STEARATE, ADENOSINE, ALLANTOIN, PANTHENOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, SEA WATER (MARIS AQUA), CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER EXTRACT, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, GALACTOMYCES FERMENT FILTRATE , PENTYLENE GLYCOL, POLYGONUM MULTIFLORUM ROOT EXTRACT, PHELLINUS LINTEUS EXTRACT, ANGELICA GIGAS ROOT EXTRACT, PAEONIA LACTIFLORA ROOT EXTRACT, SESAMUM INDICUM (SESAME) SEED EXTRACT, SOPHORA FLAVESCENS ROOT EXTRACT, CIMICIFUGA RACEMOSA ROOT EXTRACT, MORUS ALBA BARK EXTRACT, SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS ROOT EXTRACT, CENTELLA ASIATICA LEAF EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID, HYALURONIC ACID, HYDROLYZED SODIUM HYALURONATE, MADECASSOSIDE, CARBOMER, TROMETHAMINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, XANTHAN GUM, SODIUM PHYTATE, BETAINE\n\nWhere To Buy (Evenprime Site - $32.00 USD - 50ml): [https://evenprime.co/collections/all/products/evenprime-moisturizer](https://evenprime.co/collections/all/products/evenprime-moisturizer) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fpmjp8sm3w51.jpg?width=4478&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed52b4aa2ef9dc48a80f5148feea62f55e8f8c83",

    "body": "Ive been searching for a replacement for a good cleanser for my dry-dehydrated-sensitive skin. I thought I found my HG cleanser this year with the B Lab Matcha Cleanser which left my skin clean but soft. I fell in love just from trying a free sample from Stylevana. Unfortunately B Lab changed the formula and packaging for this cleanser. I bought the new version and hated it. It was dry and stripping like the Senka whip cleanser. \n\nSo I went through some suggestions from this sub and made a list. I was browsing a local shop today and saw the Round Lab Dokko cleanser for $11 for 150 ml and bought it. Beauty of Josean Green Plum cleanser was also on my to try list but it was $12 for 100 ml so I went with the Round Lab just cuz of the better price per ml.\n\nOverall rating: 4/5\n\nScent: mild soapy scent. Nothing offensive. Barely noticeable. \n\nI latered a dollop in my hands with water then washed my face and rinsed with water. It doesnt really foam up. It cleaned off my skincare, Etude eyebrow pencil, Lilybyred blush, Romand water tint, and Stila eyeliner well.\n\nMy skin didnt fee taut/tight. The cleanser didnt leave a weird filmy layer either. It was just my skin but clean. Its light but I wouldn’t call it hydrating — probably because of my dry skin. Best of all, no irritation. \n\n It didnt feel as soft as the og B Lab matcha cleanser though. I might explore other options after I use up this Round Lab one, but this is going to be my fallback cleanser from now on as long as the formula didnt change. \n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline",

    "body": "Hello everyone, I’m a long-time lurker and first-time poster on this sub.\n\nI’m 29(F) and my skin type is fucked up (dry cheeks, oily T-zone, with a recent bout of hormonal acne along cheekbones and jawline).\n\nI use Epiduo that has adapalene (0.1% w/w) + benzoyl Peroxide (2.5% w/w) and Glyco-12 cream (glycolic acid 12%) in my PM routine (alternatively, with a break day in between each treatment). In the AM, I finish up my skincare routine with Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ and touch up with a sunscreen stick every two hours or so (I go over the same area 3-4 times with the stick for optimum protection).\n\nLike most people, I struggle with sunscreen reapplication because, honestly, it’s a pain in the ass. I’d rather put it on once in the morning and then forget about it for the rest of the day. However, as I’m currently battling hormonal acne and PIH brought on by PCOS and the fact that I stopped taking oral birth control pills, I’ve been subjecting my face to some pretty strong actives like adapalene and glycolic acid. And, I’ve also recently had some warts removed from around my eyes and on my neck via cauterization. Given these treatments and because I spend a lot of time outdoors, I knew I had to become more diligent with sunscreen reapplication to prevent sun-related hyperpigmentation. And since I’m lazy af and don’t like touching my face often, I turned to sunscreen sticks. Please note that I do not know much about the ingredients, but have listed them below for reference. Here is my review of the three sunscreen sticks I’ve tried so far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4v40q0j04t91.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57160c139b133d631630407c20ffca566e08110b\n\n**1.** **TOCOBO Cotton Soft Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1240\n\n**Experience and opinion:** I really had high hopes for this one, I saw so many good reviews online. To be fair, its not a bad sunscreen stick. It glides on the skin easily enough, and sinks into your skin to give a matte powdery finish. But, it has a strong (imo) scent. It’s a linen-y kinda scent, which I just don’t like. This scent even lingers for quite some time after application, which makes it even more annoying. Honestly, I don’t care about fragrance in skincare as long as I like the fragrance, and I just don’t like the fragrance in this sunstick.  Another con is its shape, which makes it hard to use under the eyes. Overall, if you don’t mind the fragrance, it’s a decent sunstick.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP, I can’t get over the smell.\n\n**2.** **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1480\n\n**Experience and opinion:** My absolute favourite and current HG for reapplication! You can see from the picture that the writing on the packaging has faded because I’ve handled it so much. It has no fragrance, just a faint chemical scent which dissipates quickly after application. It takes a few seconds to warm up on your skin, after which it glides oh so smoothly. It has no white caste, and has a matte satin-y finish, which I LOVE. A little bit tacky to touch immediately after application, but sinks into your skin in a few minutes and becomes barely noticeable. Best part: its tear drop shape!! This makes such a difference, it makes it so easy to touch up under my eyes and around my nose.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WRP absolutely I love it so much!!\n\n**3.** **Avène SunsiStick KA SPF 50+**\n\n**Ingredients:** Octyldodecanol, Polyethylene, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Hydrogenated Microcrystalline Wax, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Beeswax (Cera Alba), Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Water (Aqua), 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Root Extract, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Oxothiazolidine, Saccharin, Sodium Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Tocopheryl Glucoside.\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Box of Color for INR 743.\n\n**Experience and opinion:** This was the first ever sunscreen stick I purchased and it made me almost give up on all sunsticks. It has a chemical-y waxy kind of fragrance but my biggest qualm with this sunstick is its texture and finish. It has a Vaseline-kinda balm-y texture that just sits on top of your skin and looks like you’re slugging during the day. Needless to say it gives an oily finish, not even dewy, which looks awful on my skin type. Its extremely transferrable and gets all over your hands if you happen to touch your face. I despise it and I’m not sure how I’ll use up the product.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP never ever, god I hate it.",

    "body": "Disclaimer: I’m related to the business for Besfren Beauty and Masksheets.com. But in the contents below, I didn’t put any products that are sold under the business or plan to be sold in the near future. The purpose of this writing is purely for information sharing and fun. If any of the contents below are problematic, please let me know. \n\nThere’s a sort of fixed trend for launching new cosmetics in Korean brands. From April to May, they bring sun-related products such as sunscreens, sun cushions or sun sticks. In summer, of course, light textured pore clearing products or brightening products are popular because of highly humid Korean summer. When the weather gets dry like now, deep hydration lines are on their best time. Korean winter is notoriously dry and many Koreans buy their F/W skincare routine around this time, so it is very important time for Korean brands as well. \n 3~4 years ago, oil based, fast absorbing, rich textured products were very popular, especially ceramide (Dr. Jart’s Ceramidine / Holika Holika’s Good Cera), omega-3 (IOPE’s Super Vita) and argan oil (many brands) contained products. Snail filtrate is all time favorite for all people so I won’t mention it much. Of course, facial oils are always “Must Launching” items.\nBut this year, the trend seems a little different from previous year. So I prepare some update for 2016 F/W Korean cosmetics, mostly from the road shop brands. \n\n\n1.Innisfree, the controversial Ture Care Cica Balm / New skincare line, The Black Green Tea \n\nSo, Innisfree also launched this year’s hot ingredient -Centella Asiatica-based balm in early September. They actually did very brilliant marketing this year. They give away 5 day trial sample of this balm, promising improvement on acne scars (at least in the promotion video, it seems like working and I was quite satisfied with the 5 days trial as well). The early batches were sold out fast but interestingly the reviews are quite polarized. While many reviews, people stated actual and visible improvement on acne scars, but at the same time some of the reviews were complaining about break-outs and redness. Seemingly, these break-out or sensitivity comes from added retinols or stearic acid. (They are commonly used ingredients but sometimes it may induce sensitive on skin)  So if you plan to buy this, please do the patch test before you use. Innisfree offers “Responsible Refund Policy (책임환불제),” so they give 7ml trial sample for free. It will be a little difficult for us to benefit from this policy though. Fermented Black Green Tea line is newly introduced as well. There are 3 types of products - serum, cream and wash off mask. In the website, it is stated that cream contains shea butter and serum contains platn squalene (From veggie oil) for oil so I think it will be a good hydration line for winter, if you like Innisfree. \n\n \n\n2. Etude House, Glow on Oil Volume Base\n\nSince Etude House is heavily makeup focused brand, they didn’t introduce any new skincare line this F/W. If they do, I will update you later. The Facial Blur was a quite a thing this year. This shimmering primer quickly became the queen of glowing primer along with VDL’s Lumilayer. Certainly, they are inspired by Mac’s long time steady seller, the Strobe Cream. The difference is, they give much more natural look on face since Strobe Cream. Anyway, Etude House introduced another glowing primer this winter. The texture is not very mineral/shimmering like Blur, rather it provides oil/watery glow on your face. Texture is in between watery serum and facial oil, and contains golden shimmering particles in them. It feels much lighter than Nymph Glow or Blur, so I think this will be quite popular soon. They introduced lighter version of this base (Glow on Hydra Volume Base) as well. \n\n\n3. The Face Shop – Korean Traditional Medicine Inspired\n\n예화담 채율 생기 순환 에센스 (CHAEYUL Revitalizing Essence) was introduced this F/W. This serum is made from LG’s high-end brand “The History of Whoo” and formulated with lactobacillus / bean fermentation filtrate, plant squalene, shea butter and many other herb extracts, along with conventional ingredients. Interestingly, titanium dioxide is added for unknown reason (seemingly for the instant brightening). Since it claims to be Hanbang (Korean Traditional Medicine) cosmetic, it contains many herb extracts but compared to other brands, this serum doesn’t seem new. So in my humble / personal opinion, The Face Shop’s F/W was quite disappointing. (I’m not saying this product is bad or something, but I’m just saying it seems quite conventional compared to other brands) \n\n\n\n4. Tonymoly – Black Tea London Classic Serum\n\nSo, probably, this F/W is a Tea Time. While Innisfree uses Green Tean, Tonlymoly brought Black Tea. They had collaboration with Taylors of Harrogate this year and they use black tea extract from England. They use black extract as a base, and added niacinamide as a brightening / anti-aging ingredient. They said Aureobasidium pullulans (black bacillus) filtrate was added but I couldn’t find them from their ingredient list, probably they are contained in their black tea extract base (56%). I think their composition approach is commendable since all of their ingredients are under EWG 2 level. It feels pretty nice and watery but sunflower seed oil and bergamot fruit oil nicely give hydration lock-up for skin. I was quite happy to see Tonymoly’s Black Tea London Classic Serum because I could see they tried really hard to make this serum with safer ingredients. Believe me, it is not easy to make a cosmetic without EWG 3,4,5 ingredients without compromising the texture. \n\n\n\n5. The Saem – Urban Eco Waratah Cream \n\nAlthough Waratah didn’t come out this F/W, it is rather under-appreciated and it is a deep hydration line, so I will talk about this cream here. Just like the Saem did with many other products, the Saem substitute water with Waratah extract (55%) and used it as its base. As they market this cream as “skin protection layer strengthening cream,” they added some skin identical, skin repairing molecules like ceramide NP and Phytosphingosine. I think one of the greatest strength in the products of the Seam is texture. This cream has fast-absorbing, silky, non-sticky texture. So if you are more like a texture person, this cream may be the one for this F/W. Ah, dimethicone is added for the texture, so be aware if it concerns you. But texture is just like heaven  \n\n6.\tIt’s Skin, Flower Cell Cream \n\nAfter their famous snail cream, it’s skin’s skincare line has not been very successful for past few years. This year, It’s Skin brought Firming cream with Edelweiss Callus cell culture extract. I know callus cell culture’s skin improving ability is controversial and not scientifically proven most of the time, it is just nice to see It’s Skin’s new product. Other than Edelweiss callus cell culture extract, the composition is pretty conventional but they added good moisturizing ingredients like squalene, sodium hyaluronate and betaine. Adenosine is added as firming / anti-aging ingredient. As I mentioned above, I am really glad to see new skincare line from It’s Skin, but it’s quite questionable that this product will do really well in this competitive market this F/W because of their passive marketing and no “Wow” or “New” factor in this product.  Package design is also somewhat old as well. \n",

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it’s pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin. So I started mixing it with my moisturiser and things were good !\n\nBefore this I have only used Sugandha vit C which I also liked and Minimalist 10% vit C which did nothing for my skin.",

[These](https://imgur.com/0usXnff.jpg) [photos](https://imgur.com/C5Ze0Ci.jpg) [were taken](https://imgur.com/P7jxw8L.jpg) [at 10 PM](https://imgur.com/k14jWR5.jpg) . I had applied lip balm once in the morning at 10 ish and then no more re-applications. Ordinary lip balms do jackshit for me. The general tube lip balms like Nivea, Maybelline, Lakme etc simply can't keep up, I have to apply those once every half an hour. Also **I'm not on tret** or anything like that currently.\n\n# \n\n# ENN Pucker\n\n* **Review Type:** Rave\n* **Price (range):** INR 900 for 15 gms, bought it at 25% off for 675\n* **Availability in India:** Easily Available online on ENN's own site, Nykaa and other\n* **Skin info:** Dry. Extremely dry, prone to chapping. Dry in all weathers. Dry since I was a child. Dry.\n* **Ingredient list:** [Shea Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Jojoba Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/simmondsia-chinensis-seed-oil), [Castor Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ricinus-communis-seed-oil), [Beeswax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [E Wax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/e-wax) 📷, [CCTG](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Honey](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/honey), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Tocopherol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopherol), [Hyaluronic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hyaluronic-acid), [Butterscotch Flavour](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butterscotch-flavour)\n* **Special info:** [Packaging instructions](https://imgur.com/7ZeyJDs.jpg) say \"Patch Test recommended. For external use only. This product is not edible. In case of irritation, stop using the product immediately\". Also skincarisma says the butter and oils aren't malassezia safe\n* **Experience & opinion:**\n\n**Texture:** It's [waxy consistency](https://imgur.com/V27yke7.jpg), that can definitely feel [vaguely gritty](https://imgur.com/oWhgRT1.jpg)  sometimes, but usually feels smooth. Spreads easily.**Fragrance:** Butterscotch. Doesn't feel too artificial. Or over powering. Can smell it on application, but settles down afterwards.\n\n**Packaging:** Comes in a [glass tub with a plastic screw cap](https://imgur.com/wcXKAbw.jpg). Has a protective lip inside. [Outer packaging](https://imgur.com/PbrVT7L.jpg) is textured cardboard that comes sealed in plastic, for tamper proof, I guess. But they should try avoiding it.\n\n**Usage:** It's meant to be used as sleeping mask or night balm. Packaging instructions say \" Directions: Take the product on the tip of your finger. Apply a generous layer of this soothing mask at bedtime on your lips\"I use this primarily as a day balm. Because Dry lips.\n\n**My Application method**, I take a teeny weeny bit, scrape it off on my bottom lip, the remaining on upper lip. Massage it onto my bottom lip with my finger and purse lips and use that to spread the balm on the upper lip\n\nOn **application**, \\[[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/78FbYOI.jpg), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/nAJ2nh7.jpg), [Pic 3](https://imgur.com/kvd8S5P.jpg) in various lighting conditions\\] The grittiness is not too much and doesn't feel disturbing. but if you purse lips together there is some grittiness that can be felt. BUT this grittiness is not ever present, it's sometimes there, sometimes not there. *You can see a little speck that the grittiness left behind in the attached photos, look at the top right corner.* If you drink water like I do, like a toddler without skills, spilling and dribbling it all over you, it **may** need to be re-applied.\n\nRegarding **performance**, Little bit actually goes a long way. It creates a pink stain. Feeling on lips is similar to maybelline baby lips (when it's not gritty), you can feel it but it's not heavy or glue like or uncomfortable.On an average, this keeps my lips moisturised for 3.45 hours ± 15 minutes. This timeline is consistent. Beyond that time, lips were still soft, no chapping, no cracking for around 30 minutes, after which proper dryness would start and I would need to re-apply. Generally, I'd apply this as soon as I wake up, After breakfast, After lunch, Around 6 in the evening. So 4 times a day.\n\nI've heard tinted balms sometime darken lips, I've noticed nothing of the sort with this. I naturally have two-toned lips, and this did not even them out or anything. Nor was I expecting it too.\n\nOn **longevity**, Even with me, applying it 4 times a day, I've barely made a dent. I'm sure this will last long.. maybe 6 to 8 months, minimum (my personal opinion is that this will be one of those products that just don't die). IF, of course, it doesn't spoil or something, because like I said, don't know if there's a preservative. And if you are going to use it only at night time, I'd estimate a year.\n\nEditing on 20/10/2020 : There's a dip in my tub already, I'm revising my estimate to six months. Will update once again when I complete the tub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I use it the way I've outlined above, For the purpose of this review, I also tested it out as a\n\n* Healing balm - With first application being at 11:30 PM, second at 1:30 AM (applied a very thick layer) and repeated applications at 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 2:30 PM, 5:30 PM, 7:00 PM, 10;00 PM,  lips had come to normal at 1:00 AM. But at 8.15 the next day, Lips were verging on dry again. That is they feel soft to touch but I could feel the dryness starting.\n* Sleeping Mask - It does okay and moisturises for 7 hours IF, lips were previously in a good shape and by that I mean, no dryness, no cracking, no peeling. If there was any prior dryness, I'd up with peeling, lips. And even if everything was great, if I slept for longer than 7 hours I'd wake up with chapped lips.\n\n**Analysing Price**, at 675 for 12 months in the case of use as a sleeping mask and at 1350, in the case of a daily balm, I'd say it's worth it. Even a normal balm like maybelline baby lips would be (140 \\* 12 = 1680), Neutrogena (190 \\* 12 = 2280). Buy ONLY ON DISCOUNT. \n\nEditing on 20/10/2020, 675 \\* 2 is 1350 and at this price it maybe a skip. At full price 100% a skip. I've bought some other stuff that's hopefully more cost effective. Will try it out and review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. No spatula. Don't listen to the packaging instructions and dip your fingers inside. They make no mention of preservatives.\n2. Can scrape it off with a spoon but Have got to use fingers while application.\n3. Might get messy if you're using this in professional / office set up. Have to wash hands each time. or keep multiple spoons and tissues with you at all times, of course this doesn't count if you have normal human lips and only use it as a night balm.\n4. I'm not convinced that the ingredients list is complete. **I DMed ENN's insta account asking if this was the full list and whether there are any preservatives,** [**I've been left on read**](https://imgur.com/t896G3O.jpg)**. Make of that what you will.** If I ever get a reply, I'll update that as well. **Edit: Got a reply \"No preservatives in pucker. It's only made up of butters.\"**\n5. No SPF (this is a personal con, since they meant for this to be used differently) but I'm mentioning it for other lizard people like myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Repurchase Status:** May re-purchase, if I don't get tempted my something else.\n\n***Final Words:*** To be honest, I had major buyer's regret after buying this, and it only increased when I saw the ingredients list. Especially when I saw castor oil (Castor oil & my skin aren't friends). But I was running out of Laneige, saw hyaluronic acid and implusively bought it after reading a few reviews.  But having used it over the last two months, I'm actually pretty happy with it. Definitely good and effective for my purposes.\n\nAs with any other review / product / treatment YMMV.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Laneige Sleeping Mask [Berry Variant]\n\n* **Review Type:** Rave\n* **Price (range):** INR 1100 for 20 gms\n* **Availability in India:** Available online on Nykaa, Beautybarn and others or you's have to ship it from Korea\n* **Skin info:** Dry.

It did not heal my lips overnight the day it does for most people. My lips were in a very, very bad condition. Dry, cracking, peeling. I was removing layers of dried skin every few hours. Laneige brought me back from the brink. it took 4 to 5 days. By that I mean the first few days I had to apply it every hour, then every two hour, three hours and then I woke up with non-scaly, human like lips one day. And I fell in love. It's why I had great expectations. I've recommended to people I know IRL. Bought it as gifts. Praised it online etc. I have had a huge bias towards this balm. I used it as sleeping mask initially because that was what it was, but after experimenting I realised it's better as day balm for me. And after even further experimentation, I've decided it's best as a healing balm.\n\n**Texture:** It's has a [balmy](https://imgur.com/gg5fT1K.jpg) super smooth consistency. Spreads easily.\n\n**Fragrance:** Berry. Doesn't smell over powering. Had to sniff the tub to get a strong whiff of it. Can barely smell it after application\n\n**Packaging:** Comes in a plastic tub with a plastic screw cap. The 8gm variant does not have a spatula but the 20 gms variant, comes with a very useful silicone spatula\n\n**Usage:** It's meant to be used as sleeping mask or night balm.I use this primarily as a day balm. Because Dry lips. Same as pucker.\n\nMy **Application method**, I take a teeny weeny bit, scrape it off on my bottom lip, the remaining on upper lip. Massage it onto my bottom lip with my finger and purse lips and use that to spread the balm on the upper lip\n\nOn **application**, definitely heavier on the lips compared to most balms. A little sticky. [No stain,](https://imgur.com/ASbyXSr.jpg) [just looks glossy.](https://imgur.com/RIGBH33.jpg)  It kind of makes the vertical lines in my lips disappear. Lips get a soft-focused look even in real life.\n\nRegarding **performance**, This has never been the best sleeping mask for me,  It wears away in the night. It does heal and maintains lip health in the long term.\n\n**As a healing balm,** which is my current use for it, the mask gets rid of the dry skin. But after 3 to 4 days of continuous application and then I relax with the application. If I get lazy and don't apply balm properly and get to the cracking, bleeding stage, then rinse repeat. But so far the best at healing that I found. When I was testing this against ENN, this got my levels to same level ENN did after 9 uses, in 6 uses.\n\n**As a day balm,** the performance of this was so inconsistent, that I was getting frustrated trying to keep track of it. One day it averaged 2 hours of moisturisation, the next day 4, the third day 3. I wasn't able to average out anything. Which I did not expect at all. When it works, it works, but I'm not able to make sure it works optimally 100% of the time. It was baffling because I'd used it for almost 1.5 years. External factors seem to affect it's performance a lot, like talking a lot, drinking water etc.\n\n**As a sleeping mask,** the day I timed it and took pictures it lasted 8 hours. But again inconsistent. Some days I wake up with soft, moisturised lips and on other days, flaky ones. It's not reliable.\n\nMy two-tone lips are genetic and I'm perfectly happy with them, but in case you were wondering this balm had no effect on them. Didn't lighten or darken anything.\n\nOn **longevity**,  Little bit definitely goes a long long way. Even the little 8 gms one lasted more than 6 months, I think, as a night time balm. Now that I'm using it as a day balm the 20 gms tub lasted around 8 to 9 months (It lasted longer but there were intervals in the middle when I completely neglected skincare including this, so 8 to 9 months, is an estimate of cumulative usage.\n\n**Analysing Price**, Definitely worth the price, If you're using it as sleeping mask. Taking a conservative estimate of 8 months, the annual cost works out to INR 1460, which more than ENN but the difference isn't significant, in my opinion.\n\n**Cons:**  No SPF (this is a personal con, since they meant for this to be used differently)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Repurchase Status:** Will re-purchase only the small tub in the future, since I mean to use this purely for healing purposes, for as and when I behave like an idiot and damage my lips.\n\n***Final Words:*** It's a good option for lizard people, but definitely not the best. While it works, it works great. But it's inconsistent.\n\nAs with any other review / product / treatment YMMV.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Comparative Review of ENN Pucker and Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask\n\nPoints to Note\n\n* As always, pictures were taken from a potato phone so forgive the low quality\n* I didn't have a professional lighting set-up, so lighting is iffy and inconsistent, I chose to go with whatever light was showcasing what I wanted to convey\n* All photos are unedited,\n* All Notes are copy-pasted from my original notes and maybe in present / present continuous tense\n* The daily balm test started at 11:30, while everything else started early was because I used my normal PM routine, which keeps my lips moisturised till then, Neither Pucker nor Laneige could do that.\n* Laneige's daily day balm notes mention attempt 1, because I tried documenting it's performance over several days. Some days were better, some days worse, but this was average, so I'm recording this one alone.\n* I repeated Pucker's sleeping mask test several times as well, and results were consistent. 7 hours max, if I sleep beyond that chapped lips, so I'm adding pics at the 8 hour mark instead,\n* No other re-applications other than what I've mentioned below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**ENN Pucker**|**Laneige**|\n|:-|:-|\n|**As a daily day balm**|**As a daily day balm, Attempt 1**|\n|[11:30 AM](https://imgur.com/bETBkFd.jpg)|11:30 AM  [Applied it](https://imgur.com/ASbyXSr.jpg), first application of the day, lips had gotten a teeny bit dry, before application.|\n|1:30 had lunch, lips felt like the [moisturiser was still there before lunch](https://imgur.com/2Pp6iX7.jpg).

After lunch I couldn't feel the balm on my lips anymore, but they were still soft to touch and looked like it too.|\n|1:45 re-applied ENN. Didn't feel gritty this time. was feeling sick, too a nap. Balm was still kinda there, lips still felt moisturised.|1:45: [re-applying laneige.](https://imgur.com/hGPh66W.jpg) On a unrelated and maybe interesting note, my potato cam refused to focus on my lips after application. maybe because it was too glossy? Also I have tiny vertical lines on my lower lip, not super noticeable to anyone but me, but they're there, even when lips are moisturised. But on application of laneige, it looks like they're not there.|\n||[3:45:](https://imgur.com/NGpY6sq.jpg) it's disappeared from my lips, lips feels soft and moisturised, but will this stand against ENN? till 6:00 pm, I'm starting to doubt it|\n||4:30: starting to get the same dry feeling that I got at 6:00 Pm with ENN, Lips aren't dry yet, but will be soon. I'll try to push it for longer though.|\n||5:00, lips still okay, but will definitely start cracking soon.|\n||[5:15](https://imgur.com/ejNXVns.jpg) Actually little white flecks are visible in the pic right now. Lips are starting to get a dehydrated feel *Note: I think white specks are visible, but unfortunately photo is low quality. Sorry!*|\n||[5:40](https://imgur.com/k3ieDDM.jpg) All of the above, plus it's getting a wrinkly look|\n|6:00 re-applied. [Before Application](https://imgur.com/5w795Ph), it was edging on dry, As in not dry yet, might start to feel dry in half an hour or so, pre-re-application stain had faded, but still kind of there. lips still looked soft and moisturised. Soft to touch as well. But if you zoom in, you can see the dryness starting. Also did not feel gritty on application this time too.|[6:00](https://imgur.com/fueKxEq.jpg) no where close to how ENN looked. Uncomfortable dry feeling. *Note: Kind of low quality pic but you can see flaking starting on the left side of my lower lip. Wrinkles are super prounounced.*|\n|7:45 Had dinner|7:45 Had dinner|\n|[8:15 started PM routine so didn't reapply](https://imgur.com/G9DJU58.jpg).|8:15 started PM routine. *Note: Im adding photos taken at 7:10 PM in* [different](https://imgur.com/xyCA5kB.jpg) [lightings](https://imgur.com/tfMK9AP.jpg)*. I wasn't able to capture it well, but by that point it had reached that stage by lips feel dry and the dry part can be pressed in one weird way..like it feels like a layer on the lips, I'm not explaining this well... Look at the left side corner of the lower lip, maybe that'll help you understand what I mean. It's a crinkly paper feeling.  Also I'm attaching* [another pic](https://imgur.com/X8XLqGe.jpg)*. This pic was taken in* ***one of other laneige attempts*** *at 7:40 PM, because I think the white flakes, the wrinklyness and crinklyness are all visible in this pic.*|\n|||\n|**As a Sleeping Mask**|**As a Sleeping Mask**|\n|11:00 PM [before application](https://imgur.com/WMScdqZ.jpg), lips are soft, very very mild cracks, no dryness, not moisturised but not dry and no layer on them. Same state as laneige. Didn't apply balm after dinner. Took pictures and then applied balm.|11:00 PM before re-application, lips are soft, no cracks, no dryness, moisturised but no layer on them. 11:11 PM [Applied the balm](https://imgur.com/hFjwdyS.jpg). The pic looks soft as if it's out of focus. It's not. It looked that way in real life too. could be because of lighting, either way there's a layer of lip balm on.|\n|7: 05 [woke up with dry lips](https://imgur.com/Ol1cipL.jpg). Im shocked. I expected pucker to hold it's own. Contradictory results. Need to re-check, I knew neither of them would work for as sleeping mask, the performance of this was genuinely worser than laneige.  *Note: I did re-check and it's okay for 7 hours. Chapping starts beyond that.  Also adding Pics in* [*different lighting*](https://imgur.com/NJOrZRW.jpg) *&* [*contortions*](https://imgur.com/g1F4qZa.jpg) *to showcase the dryness. See how the tint has settled into the cracks.*|7:00 [Lips felt soft](https://imgur.com/EKAZMw9.jpg) and nice on waking up and honestly after daily balm debacle I must confess I had low expectations. Lips did not feel moisturised per say but they felt soft. Normal. They way normal humans probably feel, instead of the lizards that I evolved from. BUT. Within half hour I were starting to feel dry. Took pictures in weird contortions to show that.|\n|||\n|**As a Healing Mask**|**As a Healing Mask**|\n|9 Applications|6 Applications|\n|||\n|||\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\n* Before I started documenting with time and pictures, I would have definitely recommended laneige over pucker.\n* I'm now pretty certain that pucker is better than laneige, for everything except extreme healing.  If lips are not chapped or extremely dry or peeling, pucker is better at maintaining that good health.\n* Even on the days laneige performed well, it only matched Pucker. Did not exceed it.\n* But leaving performance aside, I'm not happy with ENNs customer service.\n* Once again YMMV.\n* Also  irrelevant to you guys, but all these photos made me realise that my lips are asymmetrical and the blissful ignorant bubble I was in, has now burst. sigh.",

I hope I don't make too many people angry by saying this, but I have this as well. It's soothing but if I'm being completely honest, the Purito centella green level buffet serum & benton aloe BHA toner gave me better results (surprisingly,, purito has essential oils). I use both at the same time and it calms down a huge zit forming overnight. I tried to do that many times with LRP's cica balm but it;s not as anti-inflammatory as the other two, at least for my skin.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4r7uax1zxl731.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4ce9c60b5a9a66c2fc0744d75a08e95e53b50ed\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[From Geeky Posh blog](https://preview.redd.it/hetkbxbgyl731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=46ee39406e52428f993871d1ef41049841a53157)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**16. \\[IOPE\\] Derma Repair Cica Repair Cream - 3.99/5 (2,957 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/32,000 won - $27.72\n\nWATER / AQUA / EAU, PROPANEDIOL, **SQUALANE,** CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POLYGLYCERYL-3 METHYLGLUCOSE DISTEARATE, **BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER,** CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, **PANTHENOL**, DI-C12-13 ALKYL MALATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, HYDROXYPROPYL STARCH PHOSPHATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, **ALLANTOIN,** STEARIC ACID, **HYDROGENATED LECITHIN,** GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, DISODIUM EDTA, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, **MADECASSOSIDE**, CHAMAECYPARIS OBTUSA LEAF EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL.

One of the main points of mango butter is that it has skin soothing/healing properties, but it's not greasy. Honey is very good for skin because of its sugars and antioxidant value. Also, a few studies show that it can be healing for wounds. Royal Jelly, however, does not have any evidence of helping skin a whole lot.*\n\n*Potentially problematic ingredients: The oils in this are great, but the high % olive oil may be bothersome to acne-prone skin types. YMMV.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I couldn't fit more pictures in this post, but the reviews say this is a light gel cream type that absorbs very fast.](https://preview.redd.it/fnpdk02yzl731.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bd89c8b5ffb3adb0019df2bb8a49bfb8f1209a7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm sorry to keep having to make separate posts and spamming everyone.
