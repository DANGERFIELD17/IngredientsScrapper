    "body": "This occurred within the past 24 hours and could be subtitled, Adventures in Health: a Cautionary Tale\n\nSo I've had Apple Cider Vinegar on the edge of my radar for awhile, but never looked into it very deeply. My wife recently picked up a bottle of it to help with some gastric issues my son was having, but only used a teaspoon or so out of it so it was just sitting on the kitchen counter.\n\nFlash forward to a little while ago when I was closing up the house for bed and noticed it. I need to give that a try I mused, then hopped on my phone and did a quick search on recommended methods. Yadda, yadda, so many parts per ounces of water... add a pinch and dash of so and so...in the words of Sweet Brown, \"Ain't nobody got time for that.\" So I grabbed a Dixie cup and poured two fingers. \n\nNot being a total fool, I took a preparatory sip and although it had a bite, it didn't seem too bad. I did the next logical thing that people who never read directions fully tend to do...pinched my nose and tipped that sucker back. At first, I just got a little bit of the Holy Ghost and did the shimmy shakes, but they passed after a few seconds and I felt okay aside from the extremely pungent aftertaste.\n\nHey, you remember those science fair volcanos you used to make in elementary school that you fill with baking soda and food coloring, then at the last possible second, douse with a cup of vinegar before running for cover as the bubbling ooze endlessly pours from the top?  That's a really useful metaphor for my story because my baking soda stomach decided that it didn't appreciate an apple cider vinegar bath and, well, I'll spare you the details except to say that the leftover pizza I ate for lunch then wished that I hadn't was no longer an issue for my digestive system. Unfortunately, the myriad of snacks and tonight's dinner was blocking its path down the mountain, but the geyser of apple cider vinegar erupting up my esophagus convinced everything else in my stomach that life would be better down the metaphorical mountain too.\n\nThe edges of my vision went dark and I saw a tunnel of light which I doggy paddled along the ether to reach, which transported me to a place made of light. A figure approached out of the mist and I immediately recognized him as Jesus. He knelt and gently took me by the hand and slapped the back of my head and said, \"What were you thinking?\" Then everything started to fade.\n\nI became acutely aware of the smell of sulphur and a rising burning sensation in my body, but as my vision cleared I realized that I hadn't indeed been catapulted into the lower reaches of Heck (reserved for the headstrong and hasty), but I was just feeling the after effect of my stomach's sudden rebellion. I'm currently able to walk again, although my stomach is a bit jumpy and the back of my throats feels like it's been run over a cheese grater.\n\nIf you have enjoyed this story up until now, I urge you to keep your eyes peeled for my soon to be released bestseller, \"Better Bulimia Through Apple Cider Vinegar.\" It promises to be a hard hitting read.\n\nTL;DR Threw back a shot of apple cider vinegar; chaos ensued.",

OOP posts pictures along his journey and an independent redditor, /u/ thewaybaseballgo, got his real name and was able to confirm at least some of his story and connections to Uruguay from his work history and social media accounts. Even with that though, the series of events that I'm documenting here are so beyond reason that I find it difficult to have a straight forward opinion on how true this all is.\n\nPlease note that this isn't strictly chronological. Around the time of Rhodium, a couple of posts are slightly out of order to create a slightly easier-to-follow flow of events.\n\nContent Warnings: There is some ableist language in this post (Using the r* word and using autism as an insult)  \nMood Spoiler: >!WTF?!!<\n\n[**Where to buy gourds?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/ht2auc/where_to_buy_gourds/) - 17th of July, 2020  \n\nI'm looking to buy ornamental gourds in bulk for a project. I need probably 1500 or so. Does anyone know of a local farm that grows them? Thanks!\n\n---\n\n> Commenter: Why, pray tell, do you require such a gourd hoard? I already regret asking.\n>> OOP: Due to local fluctuations in the tropopause, the jet stream has been shifting rapidly in a counterclockwise vector, causing a rapid disincorporation of the Hadley vortex cells in the lower ionosphere. Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest ornamental gourd yield in recorded history. Investing in gourd agricultural futures could likely produce up to $1600 per day in passive income. However, investing at the apex of the curve would be the most conducive to profit as the arbitrage (particularly 12b-1 fees) will develop at a market share higher than the back-end load. Basically, no one will be able to buy the stock at a higher price than you, and all value invested will be retained. A preliminary market penetration investment of $50,000 would be most efficient in generating this revenue.\n\n[**I am financially ruined (agricultural futures)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/) - 18th of January, 2021  \nI have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.\n\n---\n> Commenter 1: \n>  \"biggest ornamental gourd yield in US history\"  - Yield here is crop yield but maybe OP mistook this for the investment's yield.  \n> In short he bought gourd when the supply has never been higher and demand never lower.  \n> I mean... That's impressive\n\n---\n\n> Commenter 2: [If his post history can be trusted, he's not stuck with \"a ton\" of gourds. He's stuck with about FIFTY EIGHT tons.

Both prospects seem pretty dismal, but I figure with some entrepreneurial prowess I could make my money back. I saw on a PBS documentary three years ago that some cultures use gourd instruments pretty regularly, and I imagine it's a pretty large industry in places like Brazil. Does anyone know if the market is large enough in the US (particularly in the southern great plains region) for this to be a viable strategy? If so, how hard is it to make a flute out of a gourd?

I've come up empty. But out of hunger and sheer boredom, I did find a way to make a moderately edible dish out of your standard, thanksgiving table, ornamental gourds.\n\nHere's the recipe:  \n * Cut all the knobs and warts off the gourd with a knife. Then use a potato peeler to take the skin off. This is really difficult and doesn't need to be perfect, but the less skin the better.  \n * Fill a large pot with 8 cups water, one cup apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup salt, and a bay leaf. Stir. Bring this to a rolling boil and add up to four gourds. Put a lid on the pot and boil on high for three hours.  \n * Remove the gourds and place on a baking sheet. Cut them in half and sprinkle them with generous amounts of salt and paprika.  \n * Broil on the top rack for 30 minutes, flipping half way through.  \n * Remove and cut into cubes. Serve over rice.\n\n[**RHODIUM IS SKYROCKETTING!!

I’m a grocery store employee from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Over the covid pandemic I was burnt out and acting impulsively. I made some risky investments which destroyed me financially. Sick of my mundane life in the great plains and with economic mobility out of reach in America, I decided to move to Uruguay where I had citizenship through my stepfather. I figured the small amount of savings I had managed to keep would go further in South America, and I’d be able to start a modest business.\n\nI had recently read a book about beekeeping, and had this romantic image in my head of a life out in the country, tending to my hives and selling honey at the local farmer’s market. The problem: I had no money or technical knowhow.\n\nI found a solution I believed could solve both of these. I entered an informal agreement with an ecology professor in Montevideo, which I believed was binding. This was my downfall. In exchange for letting his grad students conduct research on my cousin’s farm in Cerro Largo, he would pay for me to import Apis Cerana honeybees from Myanmar, and show me how to set up an apiary. These bees had never before been farmed in the region, and he believed it could make an interesting research paper.\n\nThe bees arrived quickly and we soon had a respectable apiary established. Bees usually don’t start producing honey for at least a year, so I was mostly spending my time helping my cousin with his other farm projects, and trying to find a part time job in Melo.\n\nThings seemed to be going well until the professor and his team stopped showing up. I tried contacting him, but he wouldn’t return my calls either. A few days later, two MGAP agents showed up and informed me that I was under investigation for the illegal importation of an invasive species to Uruguay. I explained my situation with the university, but I think it was the professor who had turned me in. Of course, the word of a respected ecologist was taken over that of an American Jew who had arrived in the country two months prior.\n\nTurns out, the bees had shown up at a few other farms in the area. Authorities were concerned they could destroy the local colonies, which have already been on the decline recently due to climate change. I was in over my head, so I ran.\n\nI arrived at the airport paranoid out of my mind. Even though I was mostly likely in for nothing more than a hefty fine, I felt like Frank Abignale. I boarded a flight to Los Angeles and landed in the US with $14 in my bank account. My friend was able to venmo me a hundred dollars, which unfortunately wasn’t enough to get to Tulsa. I found a flight to Seattle for $75 and took it without thinking. I am now writing this from the train out of the airport. God help me.\n\nTL;DR I imported an invasive species of honeybee to Uruguay and got in trouble with the authorities after a university professor ghosted me.\n\n---\n\n> Commenter: Hi, I am an Uruguayan scientific researcher and I have been working with bees for the last twenty years. Can we please get in touch? I need to talk to you. If the story is true it can cause an ecological disaster in our country.

I had originally planned to open a brick-and-mortar dondurma parlor in my hometown of Tulsa, but have been held back by the upfront costs. I've been unable to secure a bank loan to start my business, and so have had to reassess my plans. Instead of a shop, I'm thinking about serving my ice cream out of a cargo bicycle like [this](https://i.cbc.ca/1.3176072.1438373151!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/4x3_1180/dickie-dee-1950s.jpg). Unfortunately, apart from a few expensive cities like NYC or Seattle, the US is extremely unsuitable for this business model due to a century of car-centered urban planning. I've heard that \"bakfiets\" businesses are not only viable but common in the Netherlands and so believe your country is my best option to pursue my goals. I am also increasingly disillusioned with Oklahoman / American politics and would like to leave before the 2024 election if possible.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with the startup visa for entrepreneurs? I think my business idea would count as innovative, but I've heard dutch people are particularly close-minded about foreigners. Also, if I'm being honest, I'd mostly like to move to the Netherlands to go back to university and get a proper career in tech. Would I have to keep my business operating in order to remain in the country?\n\nI plan on visiting / unofficially moving to the country in a few weeks so would appreciate any advice you all have on applying for this visa. Bedankt!\n\n---\n\n> Commenter: I don't know anything about the startup visa, but your plan is really out of touch with reality. It sounds like you've done shockingly little research on any of this.  \n> Moving to The Netherlands is nothing like moving to another state. You are not a member of some privileged class as an American. You do not have the right to live or work in The Netherlands. Getting any kind of residence permit takes months to years of preparation and thousands of euros (at a minimum).  \n>Just skimming the requirements for the startup visa suggests it will be difficult and expensive. Your idea will probably not qualify as innovative. It does not sound like you have enough savings to live in The Netherlands for a year. It seems unlikely that you will be able to find a facilitator willing to fund your stay.  \n>There is basically a 0% chance that you can \"unofficially\" move to The Netherlands when you visit. That is not the way immigrating works. If you try to illegally stay you can say goodbye to any chance of getting legal status or a visa in the future.  \n>The Netherlands is in the middle of a country-wide and absolutely crippling housing crisis. You will not find someone willing to rent to a foreigner with no income and no realistic plan or prospects of getting a residence permit. I do not mean that it will be difficult – I am trying to tell you that it is hopeless. Expats making six figures struggle to even get apartment viewings.  \n>The Dutch are not \"particularly close-minded\" about foreigners. It sounds like you don't even know anything about the country you're \"unofficially moving to\" in a few weeks.  \n>Going to a Dutch university is your realistic avenue into the country, but it will cost you roughly 10x more as a non-EU national. Again, this takes years of planning. You cannot just show up.\n>> OOP: \"The Dutch are not \"particularly close-minded\" about foreigners.\"   \n>> Tragically, you have disproven this statement with the very premise of your snarky comment. Also with regards to the \"unofficial immigration problem,\" could you explain to me why the following plan won't work: I have dual US-Uruguayan citizenship and carry two passports. I could simply enter the Netherlands with one, stay for three months, then take a day trip to London and reenter with my other passport. It seems like I could continue this way in perpetuity, however I of course intend to become a naturalized Dutch citizen once my visa is approved, which I assure you it shall.\n\n[**Is Zeeland suitable for a Turkish ice cream business?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/xbqh5t/is_zeeland_suitable_for_a_turkish_ice_cream/) - 11th of September, 2022  \nHoi, I'm an entrepreneur from Oklahoma who's moving to the Netherlands in about a week. I'm hoping to start a 'bakfiets' -based Turkish ice cream (dondurma) business. Over the past few days I've been researching the best city in the Netherlands in which to base my operations, and would really love some advice from you guys. In the United States, ice cream stands are commonly associated with beach towns, and I imagine it's similar in the Netherlands. However, I have come to realize my product is both niche and seasonal in its nature. Because of this, I believe staying in a single city would be unsuitable. Instead, I am planning to travel between 4 or 5 cities during the week on a fixed schedule. Not only would this let me build a larger customer base, but also generate hype my product and efficiently generate capital. Perhaps each town would have a weekly 'Dondurma Day' celebrating my arrival. Looking at the map, it seems like the Zeeland province has the best geography for this business model. While it doesn't have any large cities, it appears to have a high density of small beach towns I would be able to easily cycle between. Furthermore, its rural character would make it easier to camp overnight as I am unlikely to have a permanent home at first due to lack of citizenship and the current housing crisis. Can anyone who's been to Zeeland corroborate the soundness of this plan? Are there any cities in particular you would recommend? Thank you!\n\n---\n\n> Commenter: You know that NL has long cold winters, which start in a few weeks, and Zeeland is basically empty during wintertime. Camping outside campgrounds is illegal and in winter very cold.  \n> Sound like a bad idea all around escpecially when just starting next week. With turkisch icecream you would probably have a higher audience during winter when selling in places with a high turkish population, maybe beverwijk bazaar?  \n> Your plan sounds better for spain or just turkey when trying to start during wintertime.\n>> OOP: Do you really think the camping laws will be enforced considering the current housing crisis?\n\n\n[**Need someone to assume monthly payments on large waterbed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/xcwzq4/need_someone_to_assume_monthly_payments_on_large/) - 13th of September, 2022  \nHey guys, I recently bought a large waterbed mattress (80\" x 85\") on a monthly payment plan. However, due to unexpected circumstances, I am now leaving the US for the foreseeable future. I decided to give the mattress to my mother in Sand Springs and she has grown quite fond of it. Unfortunately, I am unable keep up the monthly payments ($174 / mo), which last until July 2024. I was wondering if anyone would be willing to pay 85% of this in exchange for getting the bed at the end of the contract. I expect that by then I should be able to buy my mother a replacement in cash. The mattress is of excellent quality and extremely comfortable. Thanks!\n\n---\n\n> Commenter: You want someone to pay 85% of the cost of a new mattress in exchange for your promise to give it to them in a couple years after the new has worn off? Really?\n>> OOP: 85% is a fairly conservative estimate for the value after 2 years. Waterbeds suffer from very little depreciation due to their novelty.\n>>> Commenter: Are you aware how abusive this is? Like do you actually think this is okay?\n>>>> OOP: Abusive? What are you talking about? I'm not coercing anyone into a predatory loan, simply offering an unorthodox deal on a spectacular mattress.\n\n[**Does NS check if you're really 18?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/xkhj99/does_ns_check_if_youre_really_18/) - 21st of September, 2022  \nHallo, i need to take a train tomorrow from Vlissingen to Rotterdam to hopefully purchase a bakfiets. Unfortunately i cannot afford the ~50 euro round trip cost and was hoping to get the <=18 ticket. I am 26 but don't look that old. I was wondering what the odds are I could get away with this and what the fine is if I'm caught. Thanks!\n\n---\n\n> Commenter 1: Dude, you’re 26, get a freaking job!!!!\n>> OOP: I just moved here to start a business but still have limited assets for the time being. I'll be able to buy a real train ticket soon enough ☺️\n>>> Commenter 1: Dude, it’s great and I hope that your business will flourish, sincerely do. But just moving to a country and asking how to avoid stuff is a really shitty way to start, especially when the country is seriously missing labour and getting a job that would pay you that ticket in a day is as easy as it can get.\n>>>> OOP: I don't have a work permit unfortunately.\n>>>>> Commenter 1: So you don’t have a work permit but you already have a business and are waiting until it’s profitable? Sounds illegal\n\n[**Jobs that don't require a work permit?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/xzuiyw/jobs_that_dont_require_a_work_permit/) - 9th of October, 2022  \nHoi, I recently moved to the Netherlands to start a business, but there have been some contentions in my entrepreneurship visa application and I am currently in a bit of a legal limbo. I had expected to operate my business informally until the paperwork went through, but I've been unable to finance a bakfiets without a Dutch bank account, which I can't get without a home address. Of course I can't afford rent here until my business gets going, so I'm essentially locked in a Catch-22 situation. I was wondering if anyone knew of 'volunteer' opportunities here that provide housing and a stipend in exchange for work. After I graduated high school I briefly worked in a hostel in Israel that had a similar setup, though in hindsight I think the gig was pretty under-the-table. I'm currently stuck couchsurfing and camping in parks so would really like to find something soon, ideally in Zeeland or South Holland. Dank je wel!\n\n---\n\n> Commenter 1: You mistyped 'illegally'; you spelled it as 'informally'\n\n---\n\n> Commenter 2: lol this is exactly what everyone has been telling you would happen. you aren't locked in anything, you created this situation by yourself. you could have arranged all of these things before coming by doing extensive research but you chose not to listen to anyone.\n\n> Commenter 3: based on what did you expect to conduct business informally... aka illegally.... In a highly bureaucratic country, with a fairly high COL. You've been told by many commenters that this would not be possible. But here we are, and would ya look at that, ain't that the consequences of your own actions..\n\n---\n\n> Commenter 4: You are either stupid or a troll. We told you a week ago that your business plan was a bad idea and it was impossible for you to get started so we all told you not to come. We predicted all these problems you now have. Still, here you are ignoring everyone’s warnings. You are now in a deep pile of shit and it’s your own fault. No one here can help you. Take a few steps back and reconsider everything.\n\n---\n\n[**Government funds for cultural missions abroad?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Turkey/comments/yctgm6/government_funds_for_cultural_missions_abroad/) - 25th of October, 2022  \nMerhaba, ben bir girişimciyim Oklahoma'dan ve dondurma maraş'tan için yaşıyorum. Over the summer I spent a couple months traveling around Turkiye to learn how to make and juggle dondurma. I operated a stand briefly in Nevşehir, but the language barrier proved too great of an issue so I decided to take my skills back home to open a dondurma business in the USA. Due to funding issues, I am now in the Netherlands (Hollanda) but have run into the similar problems. I just don't have enough money to get started. I was wondering if the Turkish government sponsors people like me trying to spread Turkish culture abroad? I probably would only need a grant of around 500000 TL, but I think I would easily repay this over the next decade by increasing tourism to Turkiye. Does anyone know if this is possible? What agency should I contact?\n\nÇok teşekkürler!\n\n---\n\n> Commenter 1: I don't think you can find sponsors, i would advise you to contact investors instead, or take a loan.\n\n---\n\n> Commenter 2: Casually asking for a decade worth of minimum wage...\n\n> Try asking greece they'd love to have some Greek dondurmaki\n\n**Editors Note: OOP's last post was on the 10th of November, but I've marked this as inconclusive as he'll no at some point be back in Tulsa, posting another hairbrained scheme to get rich while only violating a few laws here and there**",

    "body": "My friend “Ana” and I have known each other since we were kids; we are in our 20s now. Last year we both joined a Facebook weight loss group. Neither of us are really overweight but we wanted to tone up our bodies. We became fitness buddies. We shared each others data and tracked our progress together. It was actually super helpful in helping us stay consistent.\n\nI’ve lost some weight and some inches of my waist but nothing crazy. Ana has too but it’s mostly been from her waist. She now has a very hourglass figure. I’ll always complimented her and asked how she got her stomach so flat. She said it was her “healing herself from the inside” and getting her gut health in order. Her trick was lemon water and raw apple cider vinegar; and these vitamins. \nAna is very popular and active in the Facebook group. Her progress pics always get a lot of likes and some have even gone semi viral. She’s even gotten a small following on all her social media. She shares her weight loss secrets and meals/workout regimen. \n\nRecently I was at a friend’s house and Ana’s sister Winter was also there. During dinner Winter mentioned how excited she was to start her body sculpting sessions. I always thought those non lipo procedures were a complete scam and I said something like that. She told me that they really work that it just takes multiple session to see real results. She casually mentioned how well it worked for Ana. I was shocked but I didn’t let it be known that Ana didn’t tell me.\n\nI message Ana afterwards asking her why she made it seem like lemon water caused her to lose the belly fat. She said that her private medical procedure wasn’t anyone else’s business. I accused her of basically gaslighting me and everyone into thinking that lemon water caused her belly fat to disappear. She called me a hater and that it was none of my business. I was pissed, I’ve been drinking lemon water and apple cider vinegar for months.\n\nI’m not usually one to fall for marketing gimmicks but I really thought I could trust her. I saw her belly gradually shrink so I believed her when she said it was her home remedies and vitamins. \n\nI posted our conversation to the Facebook group and I also tagged her. The post got a lot traction and was even shared to other groups. She ended being kicked out of the group. One of the rules is to be honest about whatever you did to achieve the result. The group is very focused on natural methods.\n\nShe messaged me angry that she lost a lot of followers because of me. And she had to make all her social media private due to “hate” comments. \n\nBut AITA for exposing her publicly? Did I go too far by sharing our private conversation?",

But after trying it, I can say it may appeal to those who want a slight difference. The mix of stock / liquid lets the sweet earthy taste of the carmelized onions stand out more. I too thought it would be way too much vinegar, but I used the unfiltered natural vinegar as suggested and it cooks down to a very very interesting taste. For those who prefer more beef taste, just play around with the liquid mix, use less chicken stock etc. The beauty is you can adjust it to your own taste.\n\n5 stars for soup with 10 oz of vinegar XD",

A big cloud of pi electrons above and below those aromatic rings resonating with the incident electromagnetic radiation (including visible light), and hydroxyl residues that might lose a hydrogen if the pH is right. As the bonding of hydrogen atoms and hence electron distribution change with pH, so do the wavelengths absorbed. Red cabbage juice appears red at acidic pH, blueish green at basic pH, much like the paper litmus tests for acidity you may have used in chemistry lab.",

I would quick pickle with some red pepper flakes and stick them on tacos with radishes, they're fantastic.\n\nBut recently, I have a new pickling love: blueberries. I like to pickle with apple cider vinegar, black peppercorn and a cinnamon stick or two. I've made this for both savory application (charcuterie, great pair with goat cheese) and sweet (cheesecake, and most recently a goat cheese cheesecake). Just tweak the amount of sugar for whatever you're aiming for.\n\nThe last time I pickled blueberries for that goat cheese cheesecake, I pickled them, then reduced the pickling liquid with white and brown sugar to make more of a syrup, then stored the blueberries in that. But I had extra liquid, so I kept reducing it down to a true syrup like you would put on ice cream. No exaggeration, it was one of the tastiest things I've ever made. I put that shit on every dessert for a week. Just incredible on vanilla ice cream; made some brownie sundaes and it totally elevated them. Just a complex sour sweet fruity tang that's really fun. My friends and family are going to get sick of how much I pickle blueberries the next 6 months to a year.",

    "body": "Dear cruciferous friend,\n\nI am so sorry that it has taken me so long to reach out. We have been estranged for far too long. I remember fondly enjoying you roasted over a charcoal fire in my youth, but unfortunately as my tastes changed you and I became estranged. I was enticed by the convenience of brussels sprouts and the hearty crunch of broccoli.\n\nI was so pleased to find a picture of you on the Seattle Times website of all places, beautifully roasted and braised. It made me remember the good times, and so I went out into the cold and I found you and I introduced you to my favorite Christmas present, a cast iron pan. The flavors that came from simple searing and brazing were superb, and your digestive benefits have been welcome.\n\nI'm happy to welcome you into my home once more, my inexpensive and nearly shelf-stable friend. \n\nUntil next time,\n\nSatisfied in Chicago \n\n\n\n[Skillet Caramelized Cabbage](https://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/skillet-caramelized-cabbage-with-yogurt-and-dill-is-a-surprisingly-dazzling-dish/)\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n* 1 medium head green cabbage (about 2 1/2 pounds)\n* 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n* 1 medium yellow onion (about 8 ounces), halved and sliced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced or finely grated\n* 1 teaspoon caraway seeds\n* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt, plus more to taste\n* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n* 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth\n* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n* 1/4 cup fresh dill fronds\n* 3/4 cup plain Greek yogurt (nonfat, low-fat or whole)\n\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.\n\n1. Cut the cabbage in half through the core, then cut each half into four wedges, making sure that each wedge retains some core to hold it together, so that you have 8 wedges. \n1. In a large, ovenproof, high-sided skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons of the oil until shimmering. Add four wedges of cabbage to the skillet and sear until the cabbage is well browned and slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes per side. \n1. Transfer the cabbage to a plate, and then repeat with another 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons of the oil and the remaining cabbage, transferring the cabbage to the plate once browned.\n1. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of the oil to the same skillet. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes, then stir in the garlic and caraway and cook, stirring, until aromatic, 30 seconds more. Return the cabbage to the skillet, overlapping the wedges as needed. Season with the salt and pepper, then add the broth and vinegar and bring to a simmer.\n1. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake, uncovered, for 60 to 75 minutes, or until the cabbage is very tender and the liquid has reduced to about half.\n1. Serve garnished with dill fronds and dollops of yogurt, and seasoned with additional salt, if desired.",

That’s basically seeing what you’ve got in the fridge that will go bad soon if you don’t use it, taking as many of those things as possible and making them into something tasty. A lot of people I know do it as a chore and only so they do t feel wasteful. I think it’s an adventure. \n\nTonight was fridge clean out night. We’ve been pretty good about using things lately so I didn’t have many “must use” items...just some mini sweet peppers, cabbage and smoked pork spare ribs. I sliced it all up thinly, added some onion and garlic and sautéed that with some ground mustard seed, caraway seed, cayenne pepper, a smidge of cumin, salt and pepper. When the cabbage had softened a bit I added a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and let it stew a little longer. I served it with rice. \n\nWhat I ended up with was almost a pork stir-fried version corned beef and cabbage. It was excellent, and I suspect the leftovers will be even tastier for lunch tomorrow. \n\nI think the thing I like about the fridge clear out nights it that I feel more free to experiment.  If I don’t use the ingredients they’ll just end up in the trash, so if I try some and it fails horribly there’s not a lot ruined and wasted.",

I ended my meal with 3-4 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (with the mother).\n\nI started my resistance training with [https://stronglifts.com/5x5/](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) and then gradually modified it as I became stronger and more flexible. Added in small HIIT sessions for heart health and endurance. I did my resistance training BEFORE my OMAD and always broke my fast with a lean protein shake (100% whey protein isolate).\n\nThere were also times when I did extended fasts (7 days) for autophagy; [https://www.medicinenet.com/how\\_long\\_do\\_you\\_need\\_to\\_fast\\_for\\_autophagy/article.htm](https://www.medicinenet.com/how_long_do_you_need_to_fast_for_autophagy/article.htm)\n\nThis helped accelerate fat loss and also tighten up loose skin.\n\nI made a similar post a few days ago on a different subreddit and got so much positive feedback that I thought I'd post here as well.\n\nAll questions welcomed.",

Apple Cider Vinegar is a drink you buy at the supermarket and which many people, myself included, consume for the purported health benefits as part of a daily morning routine.\n\n**Look at the video again, the bottle was already open, and nearly finished.** In fact, there is so little actual cider left, you can’t even tell if the bottle even has any liquid in it! **Clearly** It wasn’t, as you claim, opened solely to aggravate the dog. It’s also therefore a blatant misrepresentation to say the bottle was solely opened to “gain internet points.” \n\n\nIf this dog is like any other normal dog, he was probably begging or whining because he wanted some of whatever his human appeared to be eating (by bringing the bottle to his lips). My dog does the same thing, even if I’m eating salad which he hates.\n\nThe dog owner knows Apple Cider Vinegar isn’t tasty and smells weird and clearly wanted to prove this to his dog by allowing him to smell it. **How could the dog owner have possibly foreseen the dog’s reaction?**  that’s why this is so funny and appropriately belongs on this sub, because it’s an unusual reaction. \n\nDog’s smell gross, weird, very strong odorous things all the time! **Dogs, in fact, seek out these odors!** I walk past open sewers and overflowing garbage as I walk my dog through the city. I’ve seen my dog happily put his nose right up to a dead rat and other dog’s poop and pee. **Decaying animals and urine**, which are some of his **favorite** things to smell by the way, and which **are also quite strong smelling,** and have **actual ammonia** in them. Again, as any dog owner knows, dogs willingly seek these odors out. Dogs at the dog park are smelling pee and poop the whole time.\n\nAll this is really revealing is how ignorant you are of dogs in general, and how much weight you put on “internet points” or “updoots” or whatever. You do realize there’s nothing to be gained from likes on Reddit? You don’t win any prizes, or get anything that I’m aware of.

No one cares. You don’t get crowned “king of Reddit” or something because you get two thousand likes on something. I’ve had videos with 5 thousand likes. I still live in a shit apartment with my dog. **You’re bending over backwards to ascribe a malicious intent to something that is very normal as a dog owner.** as someone who adores dogs, this is hurtful.\n\nWith peace and love: Get over yourself. You’re not the arbiter of truth and justice, **you’re coming off as a self-righteous blowhard instead.** You’re not helping, you’re not a “good guy,” **you seem to lack basic observational and critical thinking skills.** People like you are far from the worst thing about the internet, but you don’t make it a pleasant place to be.

I've tried everything, all-protein, pills, even the HCG diet (500 cals/day, what the hell was I thinking?!)

The weight is slowly coming off, and staying off, and I still pretty much eat the things I want. The magic of CICO and this subreddit!\n\nTwo months after tracking my calories, I am now in the lead in our company-wide weight loss competition, dating a wonderful, encouraging man who makes me feel beautiful and loved, and clothes are feeling a bit looser. I didn't think there would be such a physical change already, and holy moly, I didn't realize -10 lbs would make such a difference in my face! \n\n[**Receipts**](http://imgur.com/a/CPrNC)\n\nI honestly can't thank this subreddit enough.

Then cut cabbage into thin/medium sized strips.\n\nWash\n\nThen measure out your salt into a seperate bowl. 2 teaspoons salt per pound of cabbage.\n\nThen a few handfuls at a time, place cabbage strips in a large pot, and sprinkle on some of your pre measured cabbage. Then toss the cabbage around so it's more evenly coated with salt. Repeat until all salt and cabbage is in pot.\n\nLet sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours. I sometimes leave it 24 hours. This will soften the cabbage, making it easier to cram into jars.\n\nThen a handful at a time, place the cabbage into a big jar. Use something to pack the cabbage into the bottom of the jar. I have a wooden wand type thing with a flat circular end to pack mine down. You could also use your fist.\n\nAs you pack it down, the water in the cabbage will start to come out. The goal is to cram the jar full, fairly tightly, with cabbage and have it be UNDER the water (because of the salt this water is actually brine).\n\nAs long as the cabbage is UNDER the brine, it will ferment and not mold. I bought 2 sauerkraut clay weights that I put on top of the cabbage to keep it under the brine, but you can use a ziplock filled with water until you get weights. Or try to find something, preferably glass, that will fit in the jar to keep it held down.\n\nThen I put my jars on top of my fridge. The most vigorous fermenting will happen in the first week. During this time some of the brine will be pushed out, so I have my jars in a plastic tray on the top of the fridge for easy clean up of the overflow brine.\n\nAfter the first week, it'll slow down. I usually top off my jars with a salt brine solution after the first week. 2.25 teaspoons per 2 cups water will make a brine. \n\nThe sauerkraut should be ready to eat after 1 week. I like to wait at least 3 though, ideally 4 or more. The longer you wait, the yummier the kraut. As time goes by, more and different probiotic strains populate in your kraut! [Check out this link](https://www.makesauerkraut.com/how-long-to-ferment-sauerkraut/) for more on that.\n\nHere's a picture of the sauerkraut I've had going on my fridge for 16 days now. You can see the clay weight inside https://imgur.com/CvjXkxj\n\nAnd here's a pic of a jar of sauerkraut without a clay weight. I used one of the whole leaves from the cabbage, folded and crammed in to keep it all held under the brine. https://imgur.com/zjdM2ox\n\nAfter a week (or two or three or more) open it and eat it! Store in fridge once you've started eating from the jar. It'll last in the fridge for a loooooooong time, but the fermentation will stop.\n\nEnjoy! :-)",

Originally, he got a job working for Coca Cola, but he was only a low level manager for the Powerade brand. He took a promotion and left to join Vitamin Water, in an effort to help rebrand the drink, which he did quite successfully. He then helped sell Vitamin Water to his old employer, Coke, for over 4 billion after just 5 years. The deal also absorbed him back into Coke, and so they brought him on as the new CMO.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that prior to this Shark Tank product sale here, he was worth an estimated 400 million. So, his Shark Tank investment here will be significantly increasing his net worth, maybe even doubling it.\n\nImo, this goes to show you that getting ANY shark is not always the best idea. It also helps to get the right shark. I am not sure that any of the other sharks would have had the same wild success, but since Rohan had already been in this space for years, and had helped build multiple drink products to be wildly successful, what better shark to choose than him?",

I worked up the courage to ask her for a photo, and was nervous she was going to be angry since she was on her own personal time, but she was SO lovely. \n\nWe stood and talked on the street corner for nearly 30 minutes, and she was incredibly sharp-witted and funny.  She had a LOT to say about the upcoming season, to the point I don’t want to post a lot of it because she kept being like “oops I shouldn’t have said that” but it sounds like the drama is going to be intense.  Some tidbits included how Heather pretends to be all chill but consistently lies about everything, how Mary is known to sleep around town, and how she was disappointed with Jen since you want to believe your friends are telling the truth. She also said the new NYC show has a really great cast. To be honest, the convo was moving so fast that I wished I could have just recorded it to listen back to later. \n\nOther observations - she is SO pretty in person. And so tiny. At one point I asked her what work she’s had because I need to copy it exactly and she said only her boobs. And the key was apple cider vinegar every day along with the skin glow Diamond facial (?).  \n\nAnd her husband was really nice too. He was right in there discussing all the drama, and they seemed to really like each other a lot and play off each other. \n\nMy only side eye was when she said Lisa Rinna was nice in real life, but it was prior to all the recent meltdowns and maybe there is an unconcious alliance between all the Lisa’s. \n\nI actually ended the convo because I didn’t want to keep her any longer, and she said she wanted to grab drinks next time she was in my city. (lol we all know this won’t happen but the fact she made me feel like it would happen was amazing) \n\nAnyway, I’m usually good at reading vibes, and she was someone I would be so down to grab Taco Bell with.  \n\nThis all makes me so excited for the next SLC season!!!",

    "body": "Few days ago I washed my hair & they came out in the worst shape ever (the second picture), almost all hair strands were stringy, oily-like & when touched would leave an oily residue on the hands. Instead of crying about it, I made a post seeking help. Over the past two years my hair always would dry with this not so clean back part & I couldn't wear my hair down because of it... \n\nYesterday, I tried my best to lift off as much dandruff & gunk from my scalp with a hair comb, took 15-20 minutes. \n\nNow, today, I gathered the advice from that posts comments & did my best: \n\n0. Brushed my hair back, then to the front (from the back), to the left & to the right. \n\n1. Rinsed my dry hair with an apple cider vinegar & water mixture (3.5 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar into 500 ml of warm water). \n\n2. Let that sit for 2 minutes. \n\n3. Went straight (did not rinse my hair with water after apple cider vinegar mixture) into shampooing (used Redken volume injection shampoo), vigorously rubbed it into my scalp.\n\n4. Let that sit for 3 minutes. When waiting I distributed some shampoo into my mids & ends. Rubbed conditioner (Hempz Triple Moisture conditioner) into my mids & ends too. \n\n5. Rinsed my hair throughly with warm water. \n\n6. Shampooed again. It lathered so so so much, I can't remember the last time my hair did that on the second wash! \n\n7. Rinsed my hair with warm water. \n\n8. Gently went through my wet hair with a towel. But the towel over my shoulders & then for an hour did some chores. \n\n9. Blow dried them for 10-20 minutes. It was really swift. \n\n10. Went through them with my WetBrush hair brush (THAT I CLEANED YESTERDAY WITH BAR SOAP & A TOOTHBRUSH).\n\n11. Took the first picture! \n\nMy hair never feel this clean! My scalp has ZERO... ZERO dandruff or just residue! \n\nTHANK YOU SO SO MUCH!! \n\nI will say, I need recommendations for:\n\n- detangling products, maybe a better conditioner because they were so so hard to brush,\n\n- heat protectants, since I will be blow drying them from now on!

The below was written by a well respected individual who has battled this firsthand for years and spent an immeasurable amount of time putting this research together. Good luck and I hope it helps others. \n\n\n\nThe first 90 days of any Gastritis Healing journey is critical to establishing some base healing so that your body can repair itself. \n\nSince not everyone here has a copy of THE ACID WATCHERS DIET by Dr. Jonathan Aviv, I am going to take some of his concepts along with my own after researching Gastritis for many years to give you some ammunition so that you can come up with a Gastritis protocol that works for you. \n\nFirst and foremost, do your best to find the ROOT cause of your Gastritis.  Please note that Gastritis is not a disease, it is inflammation of the stomach lining and it is a SYMPTOM of something else. \n\nIt is a SYMPTOM of an imbalance somewhere in the body. \n\nSome of the common causes of Gastritis are: \n\nAlcohol \nCoffee (yes, even decaf)\nAspirin \nIbuprofen \nPharmaceuticals such as PPIs, antibiotics, etc.\nSoda\nAcidic diet\nFood poisoning \nStress\nChronic stress \nChemotherapy \nRadiation treatments \nVomiting \nGallbladder issues\nLow stomach acid (hypochlorhydria)\nH. Pylori bacteria infection \n\nSome less known causes of Gastritis: \n\nHormone imbalances\nThyroid issues\nMast Cell Activation Disorder\nHiatal hernia \nSIBO aka Small Intestine Bacteria Overgrowth \nCandida infection\nParasites \nLiver issues or disease\nLyme disease\nLeaky gut (intestinal permeability)\nViruses \n\nIt may take a long time before you find the root cause, depending on you and your doctor and how amenable they are to ordering the necessary tests to find out what is causing the inflammation. \n\nNext, you’ll want to follow The Acid Watchers Diet Principle #1: \n\nELIMINATE ACID TRIGGERS \n\n1.  Eliminate all sodas - these include acidic sugar.  Carbonation is also bad for Gastritis. \n\n2.  Coffee - coffee is acidic and the caffeine relaxes the LES (Lower Esophageal Sphincter) and irritates the stomach. \n\n3.  Most teas - most teas either have caffeine or are full of additives and chemicals that are not good for an already inflammed stomach lining. \n\nYour best bet is to drink ORGANIC chamomile, lavender, fennel, anise, ginger, marshmallow root, or licorice teas. \n\n4.  Citrus fruits - lemon, limes, oranges, grapefruit, and pineapple are too acidic to eat or drink during the 90 day healing phase. \n\n5.  Tomatoes - too acidic and the lectins bother a lot of people.  Personally, my research leads me to believe that my body does not like the lectins in tomatoes and will probably only eat them once or twice a year even though my Gastritis is now gone. \n\n5.  Vinegar - it is extremely acidic and will activate Pepsin.  Do not take ANY vinegar in ANY amounts during the healing phase.  It’s so acidic that one slip up can you set you back months. \n\nIf your doctor advises you to take apple cider vinegar with water because you have low stomach acid or enzyme production remind her that you have Gastritis and that you don’t want to activate the pepsin molecules and cause more damage to your esophagus or your stomach. \n\n6.   Wine / Alcohol - all varieties of alcohol are carminatives, meaning that they loosen the LES.  And wine, in particular, is very acidic. \n\n7.  Caffeine - coffee, energy drinks, workout powders with caffeine, most teas have caffeine and should be avoided.  A good coffee substitute is Teccino. \n\n8.  Chocolate - chocolate contains methylxanthime, which loosens the LES and increases stomach acid production. \n\nSomething else to think about:  according to Dr. Daniel Twogood, in his 30 plus years of clinical experience, that chocolate was the number one cause of chronic pain in his patients.  In about 40% of his patients who came to him with chronic pain, they got better simply by giving up chocolate. \n\n9.  Mint - it’s a powerful carminative so stay away. \n\n10.  Raw onion and raw garlic - both are carminatives.  They are also fructans which means they cause the Intestines to absorb water. \n\nStay away from both, even if cooked, during the 90 day healing phase.  You can gradually add them cooked later. \n\nContinued....    \n\nACID WATCHERS DIET PRINCIPLE NO. 2: \n\nRein In Reflux-Generating Habits \n\nThis just means to eliminate things that will cause relux and/or make your gastritis worse. \n\n1. Eliminate all smoking - cigarettes and other sources of inhaled smoke are carcinogens, loosen the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and stimulate the release of gastric acid.  This is even more critical for those of you with esophageal issues, a hiatal hernia, or GERD.  You cannot heal until you give up smoking. \n\n2.  Drop processed foods - the majority of processed foods have chemicals which are acidic or loosen the LES.  Dr. Aviv has 3 exceptions to this rule: \n\na.  Canned tuna (in water only).\nb.  Canned chickpeas (organic only)\nc.  Canned beans (organic only) \n\nThe chickpeas and beans must be thoroughly washed and rinsed to eliminate any traces of acidified liquids. \n\n3. Say goodbye to fried foods - fried foods not only CAUSE rampant bodywide inflammation, but they loosen the LES. \n\n4.  Eat on time - Dr Aviv advises to eat 3 meals per day and two mini meals per day.  My Naturopathic doctor has me eating 6 to 8 mini meals per day.  \n\nWhatever you decide to follow it is important to eat smaller meals throughout the day as it is much easier on your stomach. \n\nIt also helps regulate blood sugar levels (so does intermittent fasting by the way). \n\nIf you have SIBO or IBS these smaller meals help your food digest faster and gives the bad bacteria less time to spend on stealing nutrients that your body needs. \n\nBy eating smaller meals throughout the day this will keep your blood sugar levels more even and will make you less susceptible to strong food or sugar cravings.  I personally always keep carrot and celery sticks, avocado slices, and small salads handy for whenever I get a food craving. \n\nDr. Aviv recommends the following food schedule, of course adjust the times that work best with your schedule: \n\nBreakfast 7AM\nMid morning mini meal  10AM\nLunch 12:30pm\nMid afternoon mini meal 3PM\nDinner 6-7:30pm (no lying down for at least 3 hours). \n\nACID WATCHERS DIET PRINCIPLE NO. 3: \n\nPractice the rule of 5 \n\nThe rule of five means that during the 90 day healing phase for Gastritis you will eat foods with a ph of 5 or higher.  This will help suppress Pepsin activity which is necessary to help your Gastritis heal. \n\nThis is not a complete list but here are some foods that have a ph of 5 or higher: \n\nFish:  salmon, halibut, trout, sole\nPoultry: chicken, turkey, eggs\nVegetables and herbs:  spinach, lettuce, arugula, kale, bok choy, broccoli, asparagus, celery, cucumber, yams, sweet potatoes, carrots (not baby carrots), beets, mushrooms, basil, cilantro, parsley, rosemary, thyme, sage \n\nRaw fruit:  banana, Bose pears, papaya, cantaloupe, honeydew, avocados, watermelon, lychee \n\nDried fruit:  dates, raisins, shredded coconut \n\nCondiments: Celtic salt or pink Himalayan salt, coconut oil, hemp oil, olive oil, Bragg Liquid Aminos, Organic coconut aminos, hemp protein, vanilla extract, white miso paste \n\n============================ \n\nPaul’s Thoughts On The Acid Watchers Diet \n\nThe Acid Watchers Diet (hereafter AWD) is a good starting off point as far as figuring out what to eat.  I highly recommend it. \n\nAs great as the book is there are some limitations to it and the most obvious is that the book is focused on reflux and silent reflux (aka as LPR), not Gastritis. \n\nSince the book is NOT focused on Gastritis it is important to note that because Gastritis is an inflammation problem, that going on an anti-inflammation diet is very important. \n\nAlso the 28 day healing period is not long enough for some forms of Gastritis.  I recommend staying on the Healing Phase of the AWD for at least 90 days and then adding one new food every 3 to 5 days. \n\nFor the first 90 days you should stay away from: \n\nAll gluten\nAll dairy \nAll soy products\nAll nuts \n\nAnd then introduce one new food item once per week after the 90 day healing phase. \n\nDuring the 90 day healing phase you should only drink: \n\nAlkaline water\nNatural spring water (usually normally alkaline also)\nStructured water\nCoconut water (no added sugar)\nUnsweetened almond milk\nHomemade water kefir\nChamomile tea\nLavender tea\nAnise tea\nFennel tea\nLicorice tea\nMarshmallow root tea\nGinger root tea \n\nOne of the most effective ways to figuring out what to eat is start an elimination diet.  Start with 1-3 safe foods, eat them for a few days, then add one new food every 3-5 days.  \n\nIt is absolutely essential to keep a food journal and to write down when and how much you ate and then write down how well you tolerated that food. \n\nA number scale works wonders.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would write down a 0 if the food was soothing and a 10 if the food caused me complete agony.  This is how I was able to figure out which foods to eat. \n\nIt’s a lot of work and can be frustrating at times, but it was worth it in the long run. \n\nTHE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT? \n\nHaving gone through hell and back with severe chronic gastritis with erosions, complicated with grade 3 esophagitis, hiatal hernia and Barrett’s Esophagus, I learned a lot by reading a lot and lots of trial and error. \n\nThere will be days, weeks, maybe even months where you feel you’re not making progress.  You will wonder if you will ever feel better again. \n\nI cannot begin to emphasize how destructive these thoughts are and what impact they have on healing.  I know it’s tough.  In fact, it’s very hard.  And some days you’ll feel so awful that nothing you do will change your mood. \n\nThe first thing you should understand is that the human body was designed to heal.  So Gastritis can be healed. Unfortunately, sometimes it may take checking your liver, pancreas, gallbladder, thyroid, Small Intestine, vitamin d levels, a stool test, a breath test, or an endoscopy to find out what may be causing your symptoms (to name a few). \n\nIt is important to keep on digging and finding a doctor or doctors who are willing to dig deeper with you to help you not only get the proper diagnosis but to also find the ROOT cause behind your Gastritis (or any health issue). \n\nYour mindset is your most powerful ally because it goes beyond just having a positive attitude.  It means being proactive, not being afraid to question your doctors and to demand (politely but assertively) tests that you need to find out what is causing the inflammation in your stomach. \n\nDuring painful flare ups, stress and anxiety can be at an all time high.  It is essential to manage these as well as possible.  I discovered that walking, even if it was just in circles in my room, helped alleviate my symptoms.  On really bad days I would walk in my room, standing as upright as possible, sometimes for hours. \n\nYes, I would take 5-10 minute breaks if I got tired but noticed that MOVEMENT and standing upright, helped keep my stomach and my stomach acid down.  This is even more important if you have been diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. \n\nI also took sips of alkaline water every 10-15 minutes. \n\nA heating pad was a life saver too.  \n\nDuring my worst flare ups when I was doubled over in pain, I would place a heating pad on my stomach for 20 minutes on and then 10-20 minutes off.  It helped with the pain and the inflammation. \n\nBear in mind that unless your family, friends or peers have gone through horrible digestive pain, they won’t understand what you are going through.  So be patient with them. \n\nThey mean well most of the time and may even say some things that sound insensitive.  Just realize that they don’t understand. \n\nWith this group here you have hundreds of people from around the globe who understand you. \n\nSo you are not alone and you will get through this.  Please learn from our mistakes and make the necessary life style and diet changes so that your body can start healing.\n\n- by the gastritis support group on fb.",

I no longer feel alone and misunderstood. I got diagnosed with gastritis when I was 19-20. I healed, relapsed, healed, and now I’m 29 and just recently back on this painful wagon. It has been about two weeks now and just about a week ago started my PPIs- omeprazole (intake 2 pills/day) treatment and I understand it takes time for it to kick in but man, I don’t feel like it’s helping and this time around this gastritis is no joke. I don’t ever recall it being as painful as it has been these past few weeks. I was tested for many things for pancreatic enzyme levels, H. pylori (never been positive for it) through stool sampling, the whole gang of bloodwork and everything is normal and negative. So in addition, my PCP prescribed Pepcid, zofran for nausea, and buspiron for my anxiety due to university/hw stress. However, Idk if I even want to take new medication since omeprazole doesn’t seem to be working. Bottom line is, I truly appreciate all of this information and everyone in this subreddit. This place is a game changer, life changing experience. And I’ve only been on here for no more than 2 hours and I already feel connected, not crazy, not feeling like I’m making this stuff up, definitely no longer misunderstood, and already feel like I’m on the road to recovery from this terrible disease like feeling(s) we all feel by having gastritis. So thank you, thank you all for disclosing everything that has been placed here. You’re truly all god sent, appreciated, and most of all I’m praying that you all recover from gastritis and any other illnesses!!!!! I’m rooting for you all!",

Intermittent fasting in a reasonable way is way closer to the natural form of eating our body adapted to for the longest time of humankind. The health benefits of it are widely documented, and I think it can play a positive role especially in symptoms where the underlying problem is inflammation. What I could imagine is that you feel the symptoms of your inflammation more on an empty stomach rather than a filled one, where the dominating feeling might be the fullness of your belly. Another reason you might come to this conclusion might be that your eating too much when you‘re eating during intermittent fasting. Otherwise when you‘re logically thinking about it, not overloading your gastrointestinal system constantly with food (only a normal thing in our civilized life) should be beneficial for your stomach and colon and should support their healing. despite my knowledge I’m not in your shoes and can’t definitely guarantee what I’m saying is applying to you though. \n\nTL;DR Just wanted to say that from my perspective it’s highly unlikely that reasonable fasting periods CAUSE gastritis, it might influence the sensation of it though",

        "body": "Well we’re all different, but I have found that you must rigorously cut salt, I mean all of it, don’t add salt to anything, don’t even eat canned tuna or anything salty. Fat must be eaten in a very limited amount, no more than 6 grams a sitting. Take it easy on sugar and stop ingesting anything Acidic. By that I mean no booze, no caffeine, and try not not eat anything under 5.0 on the ph scale. When you do eat, keep it small, like a small white ceramic bowl. Eat slowly, chew well. I usually eat like that 6 times a day.\n\nI also took pantoprazole 30 minutes before my first meal and last of the day. Don’t eat for at least 3 hours before bed.\n\nI also take DGL before meals throughout the day. Don’t even drink too much water at once cuz it stretches a stomach which is essentially wounded. You wouldn’t want to stretch a gash on your arm, neither would you with your stomach.\n\nThe last part of this is time. I found that if you follow this stringent regiment to a T, you’ll start feeling pretty good within just a few days, but step outside of it for even just a day, and the inflammation will return and you’ll quickly feel terrible again. Even when you’re feeling good, it will take time to heal. It will undoubtedly take months, but this surely does work. This is my third time around on this and I fully understand it now. I have healed in the past so I know I can heal again.\n\nWhat we have to be honest with ourselves about is that even when you’re healed, you can’t go back to old ways. That’s why I fell back into this. I thought I could simply just go back to my old drinking and eating habits, but that was the incorrect attitude. Once healed, you still have to watch your diet and maintain good habits, but the optimistic truth is, you will be able to still enjoy a large variety of foods in moderation. \n\nHope this insight helps!

Nothing ever showed up as being even remotely pernicious or concerning.

One can still enjoy those extra tasty meals a few times a week, or occasionally have a cup of coffee. Even spend some lake days drinking beer while boating in the summertime. But one thing is for sure, these kinds of things must now remain in the minority; treats on an occasional basis. Consistent indulgence (whether it be weeks or months) will inevitably result in relapse. \n\nCheers, hope your battle is going ok:)",

        "body": "While I agree that intermittent fasting seems more likely to exacerbate gastritis than cause it...\n\nAs someone with a background in history and anthropology, I just want to gently push back on the idea that there's one single \"natural form of eating our body adapted to for the longest time as humankind.\"\n\nHumans live in a lot of different ecosystems, with different food availability and plants/animals. If there's food scarcity due to winter, a plague of locusts, the dry season, whatever: sure, a more intermittent eating schedule makes sense.\n\nBut if you're a forager living in an area with a lot of fresh fruit/produce? I'm pretty sure you're going to eat some of the berries and nuts as you're collecting them to take back to your community, typically the ones that are maybe too squishy to carry. That's closer to the \"eat multiple small meals throughout the day\" method.\n\nSorry this is kind of a pet peeve of mine, because it seems like every new diet that rolls around likes to claim it's closer to how we \"naturally\" ate, which particularly annoys me with Paleo and Keto because early hominids just did not eat that much meat. (This is partly why the terminology has switched from \"hunter gatherer\" to \"forager\", because the first places too much emphasis on hunting.)\n\nThere's also a trend in society (partly due to early, very racist anthropology) of viewing forager societies as being either (1) \"backwards\", \"barbaric,\" etc; or (2) some \"noble\" more pure past that we must try to get back to and also sort of fetishize. Both of these attitudes are honestly, wrong, and also harmful to how we treat foragers living today and Indigenous people as a whole.\n\nEven if we could figure out some universal diet that our ancestors are, I doubt that it would actually be healthy for everyone.\n\nEvery body is different. Even though there's evidence that intermittent fasting or whatever diet helps some people, that doesn't mean it's going to work for everyone. Just like eating fiber isn't great for folks with SIBO or gastroparesis, and eating a high protein diet isn't great for folks with chronic kidney disease. \n\nI'm telling you this because you mentioned being a medical student. When you're a doctor, there are going to be patients who tell you that the best practices you recommend do not help them. So many doctors default to \"well you must be doing it wrong\" or \"you just need to try for longer.\" This is harmful to patients, and frankly it's also bad medicine. Because in my own experience, often the things that don't seem to make sense are what point to an actual diagnosis.\n\n(Sorry, I told you this was a pet peeve 😅)",

I'm a little over halfway to my goal weight (SW:220, CW:180, GW:150).\n\nI've been doing a 16:8 but I usually hit 18:6 by accident because I sleep into it. I've been fasting since mid september. I eat around 1500-1700 calories in my window. I avoid dairy and gluten most of the time except for one scheduled cheat meal a week on Sunday. I run 4 days a week, one of which being a long run 10 or more miles. The left pic is from July of this year, right pic was yesterday. I'm hoping to lose 30 more lbs.\n\nI usually eat close to the same thing every day which is:\n\nI drink a pint of spring water with lemon, salt, apple cider vinegar then another pint with a Nuun in it.\n\nBreak the fast with 1/2 cup of chopped asparagus pan fried in half a tablespoon of olive oil with salt and pepper, 3 egg omelet with Turmeric and black pepper (some feta sometimes) and black coffee.\n\nProtein shake: a carrot, stalk of celery, 1 cup frozen berries, 2 spoonfuls of hemp protein, 1 tablespoon of natural peanutbutter, 1 spoonful of chiaseeds, 16 or so oz of unsweetened oatmilk.\n\n10 strawberries and half a cup of raspberries with 1/4 cup of mixed nuts and 2 cups of skinny pop salt and pepper\n\n2 big handfulls of spring mix, 1/2 cup of taco seasoned ground turkey and maybe some feta. \n\nLike 3 la croix and 2 more cups of black coffee, maybe a couple herbal tea and 2 nalgene water bottles sprinkled in there.\n\nI drink la croix and herbal teas in the fast.\n\nThank you to everyone here for posting such inspiring and detailed stories!

Four jars of mayonnaise, various herbs, apple cider vinegar, salt and sugar for dressings, and the 100 lbs pig with a rented smoker.\n\nEveryone ate, most had seconds.

Took a solid afternoon and into the evening with four people to wash and cut all the potaotoes. That means the most labour-intensive part could have been 4 our 5 times easier, if I did it again.\n\nLuckily I was able to donate the leftovers to a local homeless shelter, so they did not go to waste!\n\nTLDR: It really wasn't so hard, I made way too much.

The pulled pork is shoulder meat, mixed boston butt and picnic ham.\n\nSo to have pulled pork, cole slaw, potato salad, and corn like OP had for 100 it would be $12.40 per person for 4 oz of meat per person, $1240 + sales tax = $1325 for 100 if you picked it up yourself.\n\nWhole hog is a bit more expensive, it is $12 for 4 oz per person with the same sides, so that would bring it to $14.40 per person + sales tax = $1550 for 100 if you picked it up yourself.\n\nSo no, it wouldn't be the same price given the sides that they cooked and that they had whole hog, not just pulled shoulder meat.

Don’t have a lot of friends, get to my unit, going through stupid drama with a girl from back home and just ended up chilling in the barracks with the free time I had. I get a knock at the door one day, and it’s this guy who I heard was in my section but was going through SFL-TAP and the VIE-25 program so I didn’t ever see him at work. He says “hey man, heard you were new to the 2 shop. I’m heading out to the Sound for the day, want to tag along?” I’ve never spoken to this guy before, but I say sure, I don’t have anything better to do. Not only do we just go to the Sound out at Ruston Point, but he takes me out to Ocean Shores, we drive through Olympic National Park, hop in a cold-ass lake, we spent a good 8 hours out that day. He didn’t know me, but he took the time to knock on my door and show me around the PNW. We were inseparable from that point on.\n\nWe had a small friend group. Went to my first Kid Rock concert with them. Went to my first NFL game with them, Vikings at Seahawks. I remember our friend had a Vikings jersey on, and after Seattle won some dude starting talking shit to him. The guy I’ve been talking about this whole time walks up to the shit talker, tells him to shut his mouth before he catches a foot in it, and this is how we almost got in a fight outside of CenturyLink Field. \n\nJust little memories I cherish with him that I think about on days like this. Knocking out on his gross-as-fuck futon in his barracks room while we’re watching Lone Survivor. Him trying to get me to take daily shots of Apple Cider Vinegar with him. Us going to the Air Force DFAC every day for dinner. Went on a camping trip one weekend, got shit-faced and had a Park Ranger getting mad at us for being too loud around the campfire. He was my best-friend.\n\nHe left on terminal leave with his dad to drive back home to Oklahoma. Had jobs lined up with his TS, ton of money in stocks and savings. One of the few people I’ve met with a really solid plan when he left service. \nIn the early morning hours on January 20th 2019, while driving home on terminal leave, his truck swerved into oncoming traffic and hit a semi truck head-on. Himself and his dad were pronounced dead at the scene. \nRest in Peace SPC Brandon Bivens. I’ll never forget you, brother.",

    "body": "Hello! Have you heard the good news? Do you have a moment to talk about vinegar coleslaw?\n\nIt's true! Coleslaw doesn't have to be coated in mayonnaise and thick, \"creamy\" dressing! There's a better way--the Way of the Vinaigrette! It's cheap, lower in fat and calories, and bright, tangy, sweet flavor cuts through the richer dishes coleslaw is usually served with. I whip up some coleslaw almost every time we grill now.\n\nColeslaw in general is also highly customizable: green cabbage, red cabbage, mix of both; onion or no onion; proportions; flavor of the dressing; all can be tweaked and dialed in to your liking. Note that most recipes you'll find online contain *way* too much oil, so much that it ruins the fresh, crisp texture and mutes the other flavors. (Seriously, you can't even taste the vinegar if you use too much oil.)\n\nHere's my personal recipe:\n\nhalf a head of green cabbage, finely shredded  \nhalf a red onion, very thinly sliced  \n1 medium carrot, grated\n\n*Dressing:*  \n1/2 cup apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar  \n2 tbsp vegetable oil  \n1/4 - 1/2 cup sugar (to taste)^1  \n1/2 tsp kosher salt  \n1/2 tsp ground or whole celery seed  \n1/4 tsp dry mustard^2  \n1/8 tsp black pepper^3\n\n*(Edit: I have since doubled the amount of celery seed, mustard, and pepper.)*\n\nCombine all ingredients for the dressing and mix thoroughly.^4 Combine all vegetables in a large mixing bowl. Toss with dressing until all vegetables are well coated and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes prior to serving. (More time will develop more flavor.) Enjoy!\n\n-----\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] I find that more than 1/4 cup is too sweet for me, and I've thought about using only 2-3 tbsp. You do you, though.\n\n[2] Not totally necessary. As a substitute, you could try adding 1/2 or 1 tsp of prepared mustard, or more pepper. (See below.)\n\n[3] I'm thinking about increasing this to 1/4 tsp; 1/8 is such a tiny amount you can hardly tell it's there. I wanted to present my recipe in its current form before experimenting with it, though.\n\n[4] You may wish to heat the dressing in a small pot to make sure the sugar and salt dissolve properly, but it's not necessary. If you do, let the dressing cool before you pour it over the veggies; you don't want the residual heat to start cooking them.\n\n-----\n\n*Edit: I'm blown away by the response this has gotten! And I'm loving all the variations and suggestions in the comments!*",

I then rinse the cabbage once and add lemon juice, a dash of olive oil and some freshly ground pepper. No need for sugar as the brining removes the need to counteract the bitterness. \n\nThis is as good as coleslaw IMHO. I do love coleslaw too though.",

    "body": "Hey Guys,\n\nI think it will be fun for all of us lazy people to share recipes which are quick to make and healthy.\n\n**Prerequisites** - Rice cooker (must have), Pressure cooker/instant pot (optional but recommended), Blender (must have for smoothies/hummus)\n\nRecipes :\n\n* **Smoothies** - Omg, this is god's gift. I am having smoothies almost every night for dinner. Who needs to cook when you can cram in so much nutritional value in a drink and it keeps you totally full. My choice of ingredients - Cooked quinoa, instant oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, flax powder, banana, peanut butter, spinach, apple cider vinegar\n\n* **Indian curries** - Although it seems like a long list of ingredients and an exhaustive process, once you have cooked it a few times, it is the simplest thing ever. You can make a lot of curries using just a single [pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4zVQxPJmnY) of saueting onions/tomatoes first, adding spices, adding your choice of vegetables and then pressure cooking/regular cooking. I make Dal (lentils), potato curry, eggplant and others using this way\n\n* Things you can **just eat by soaking them in water overnight** and optionally adding a little salt/pepper to taste - Oats, [Kala Chana](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/kala-chana-nutritional-1892.html) , [Moong bean](https://draxe.com/nutrition/legumes/mung-beans-nutrition/)\n\n* **Rice Pilaf/Spanish Rice/Chicken Rice** in Rice cooker. Rice cooker is another great invention. I just add frozen vegetables, spices and rice in rice cooker like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlGbS10JnoQ) and out comes several tasty dishes. Heck, you could just insert a single [tomato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_9QImcJmSg) in rice cooker and it will taste delicious. I also make quinoa, steamed fish(using the [steamer](http://www.rivalproducts.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-master-catalog/default/dw4a9e9d5b/images/highres/RC101-2.jpg) part), omlette and others. If you can get a rice cooker with saute function, that is even better. People have even made [chicken teriyaki wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WO_Dv8W9Q) using rice cooker!\n\n* **Instant pot** - one pot recipes. Although I haven't personally used instant pot, my friend swear by these as they can dump all ingredients (just like rice cooker) and pressure cook very fast tasty meals\n\n* Having **nuts/vegetable baked chips/other healthy snacks** laying around for instant snacking\n\n* **Fruits** - I usually buy those fruits which I like to eat fresh i.e. grapes and apples and those which I blend into smoothies I like to buy them frozen i.e. blueberries, avocadoes\n\n* **Vegetables** - Just like with fruits, there are some I like buying fresh i.e. Arugula, Tomatoes, onions, potatoes for cooking but there are plenty which are great frozen i.e. spinach, beans, peas, carrots, broccoli, okra for stir frying/directly adding to rice cooker etc. I also like buying fresh cucumbers/carrots/radishes/beets for raw consumption or integrated into salads.\n\n* **Pasta/Spaghetti** - I love getting the whole wheat/chickpea/lentil ones and topping it off with Ragu pasta sauce, adding arugula for the crunchiness and the taste and it makes a great meal. I like experimenting with various flavors of whole grain pasta.\n\n* **Sandwich** - Whole wheat bread plus peanut butter plus tomatoes plus Spinach makes for a delicious combo\n\nCurious to see what other quick recipes you guys rely on for healthy eating.",

    "body": "33M | 6'0'' | 450lb to 190lb\n\nBefore: [https://imgur.com/baealCg](https://imgur.com/baealCg)\n\nAfter: [https://imgur.com/jtDitDz](https://imgur.com/jtDitDz)\n\nHopefully this inspires someone to start today.\n\nAsk me anything folks :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update:** Thank you for the support guys. I didn't expect the post to blow up like this lol. I will be adding some tips to my initial post to answer some questions. These are the things that worked for me and I will do my best to keep these up to date.\n\n**What I eat:** A clean keto diet focusing on whole foods and minimal ingredients. Chicken, beef, pork, eggs, tuna, fish, broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, kale. I also only drink water or unsweetened almond milk. For treats I eat macadamia nuts, pecans, almonds, peanuts, brazil nuts, pili nuts. I never have these stocked in the house because I would finish them all on day one lol.\n\n**Calorie Partitioning:** I like to keep things simple. High protein, moderate fat, 0 to low carb. On some days it will be high fat, moderate protein, 0 to low carb, but the importance is to always hit your protein goal. Protein for me is filling and also the macronutrient with the highest thermic effect. Your body will burn 20% of the calories from protein by just processing them- this is free food. If you eat a high protein diet, you can get away with eating more because the net gain is ultimately lower than if you ate more fat or carbs.\n\n**OMAD:** I complete my training before my OMAD and break my fast with a lean protein shake (whey protein isolate). I then have my meal 20 minutes later and drink 3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (with the mother) to end my OMAD. After so many hours of fasting, your HGH (human growth hormone) gets a giant spike. After working out, you get yet another spike to HGH. HGH is a hormone directly responsible for building/repairing muscle and a bunch of other critical body jobs. By breaking your fast with protein, you are priming your body for muscle building mode and reducing the chances of instant fat storage.\n\n**Resistance Training:** I started with [https://stronglifts.com/5x5/](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) and then gradually tweaked it as I got stronger. You can buy a power rack and perform all these workouts at home or go to a gym. The workouts are very time efficient and as a beginner your main focus should always be proper form to ensure you don't hurt yourself. I also do pushups, pullups, and a mix of workouts with dumbbells. You also need sleep to actually build muscle so if you're working out and eating like a beast, but not getting any rest, results will be suboptimal.\n\n**Autophagy & Extended Fasts:** I did 7 day water fasts every other month. Fasting triggers autophagy and it helps with tightening up loose skin, clearing up skin, and breaking plateaus but it also has tons more benefits; [https://www.healthline.com/health/autophagy](https://www.healthline.com/health/autophagy). Our ancestors didn't have the luxury of having food available to them the way we do and so they didn't eat frequently. A lot of the metabolic diseases we see nowadays stem from us constantly consuming and what makes it even worse is we're consuming the wrong things- a bunch of processed foods with little to no nutritional value, synthetic coloring, taste, preservatives etc. If you eat healthy AND give your body a chance to clean itself and heal, imagine what you could do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Quick Facts / Tips:**\n\n**RMR & BMR:** Stands for Resting Metabolic Rate and Basal Metabolic rate. In short, this is the amount of calories that your body burns by simply existing. Things like weight, height, sex, and age are all factors. Here is a simple yet good explanation of both terms: [https://www.verywellfit.com/metabolism-facts-101-3495605](https://www.verywellfit.com/metabolism-facts-101-3495605). There is also a calculator in there if you want to deep dive it.\n\n**Calorie Math:** A gram of fat is 9 calories. A gram of protein / carb is 4 calories. If something has 10 grams of fat and 15 grams of protein, the food still consists of more fat than protein\\~ 90 calories of fat, 60 grams of protein. Be sure to pay attention to calories from fat when going on a calorie deficit as a lot of things we eat on keto are high fat; avocado oil, nuts, condiments etc. One of my go to condiments is classic mustard as it is very low calorie and minimal ingredients.\n\n**Body Recomposition:** The more weight you lose, the more diminishing returns you will see. Your body will put up a fight to get rid of the last 5-10 pounds you want to lose because it is designed to store that fat in case of famine / starvation. You will most likely need to add in resistance training and some cardio to healthily burn off those last few pounds of fat. The good news is that if you are in the body recomposition stage, your hard work has already paid off and if you keep pushing you will see those abs and cuts soon :\\].\n\n**H2O:** Drinking freezing cold water can boost your metabolism because it forces your body to use resources to warm the water to body temperature. This may seem like a small change but if you factor this in to every glass of water you drink, the gains are huge in the long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "hi everyone, \n\ni'm extremely desperate for any type of knowledge or help on what to do. basically my dad died a year ago, & i fell into a deep depression, on another level. i stopped taking care of myself, my hair especially. it kept getting tangled very badly & id spend hours brushing it away. well the past 6 months i had it up in a bun & did not brush it i just kept it up. when i realized it was getting worse & worse, i got scared & neglected it even more to the point where the matts are extremely solid. \n\ni'm very scared & i have thick, long curly hair & i cherish it. the matts are very close to my scalp otherwise i would have cut them off. for as long as my hair was up i still don't understand how they got this bad. i've tried getting it out over the past week & a half w 5 different people & 6 different sessions. we have tried all kinds of conditioners, letting it soak, washing it, coconut oil, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, leave in conditioner. i feel so defeated & frustrated. my hair is extremely itchy & the weight of the the solid matts are causing my head a lot of pain. \n\nit was one big solid matt & one of my friends stupidly detangled it as much as she could & then cut the rest so now it's split in 2. so think of 2 golf ball sized solid matts on either side of my head an inch or less from my scalp. please help me!!!! i can't afford to go to a salon idk if that would even help. i don't have a lot of money but im wiling to try anything i can at this point. i'm going to attach photos below. \n\nfirst photo is where it was at when it was all together, before my friend cut it. the 2nd & 3rd photo is where it sits today even after the many conditioners, oils & many combs that have broken to try to get it separated w no luck. i would have just cut my hair short even tho i dont want to, if they weren't so close to my head. i would practically have to shave my head i think w how close they are to my scalp.

It’s always been so beautiful and long, and was strongly tied to how I saw and expressed myself. I’d always worn it very long and loved to play with styles and colours. I was always getting compliments on my hair.   \nMaybe 7 or 8 years ago now I decided to shave it all off, completely bald, in an effort to get myself out of my comfort zone and challenge my self image. I was trying to make big changes in my life and I thought starting with my hair would be a good way to inspire other changes(it was!). I was definitely not the type of person to do something like that, everyone was very surprised when I announced what I was going to do.   \nI LOVED it. I loved how quickly my head would be dry after a shower. I loved touching my very short hair when it grew in, like petting a cat. I loved how much cheaper and easier it was to deal with, and learning how to style short hair. I loved getting to know myself without having hair to hide behind. I loved knowing that I could still be a “girly girl” without long hair.   \nI’m not trying (or expecting) to convince you, I just want you to know that if you do decide to cut it all off, it doesn’t have to be a bad experience. Some people say that hair holds memories, so if you’ve been going through a really hard time, it could be one way to help you let go of some of that.   \nLast year I shaved a friend’s head and it was a wonderful experience, I think it really brought us closer.    \nWhatever you choose to do I hope you find relief from your pain, just from looking at the picture I can feel the discomfort.",

Start at the bottom and try to break away sections. You can alternate between using the straight end of the comb and the actual comb and if there’s a big mass that you cannot get through with a comb, you can use the very point of the thinning shears to snip the tight knots and then try combing again from there.

My dad, mum, uncles and aunts, cousins, and my three sisters and brother (all siblings between 29-22, I'm the youngest). We always blamed this on bad genes! Of course.\n\nAbout 18 months ago during the lockdowns my brother was the first one to seriously decide to lose weight, and invited all of us to do it together. I joined him after he had already lost about 20lbs but the rest of the family didn't because they didn't believe it could be done with our genes. The two of us lived in a different city so my parents and sisters weren't seeing us as the weight loss was happening (thank goodness!) so when they finally saw us in person this Christmas (first time since we started) they kind of freaked out because they had no clue. First they were happy then a little passive-aggressive, and sometimes just plain aggressive. Like we're too thin now, if we get sick we have no reserves, this is an eating disorder, etc... Honestly that wasn't too bad since back then my brother was there too, so it was 5 against 2 and we held our own/ignored them.\n\nBut I stayed (since I have a job back in my home city now) and this past month hasn't been easy. My dad is cool and genuinely happy for me, but my mum and sisters are difficult to deal with. At first they were like \"we'll eat like you do and we'll lose weight too\" and I thought great! I'm more than happy to help them. BIG MISTAKE.\n\nThey are under the impression that their diets are healthy because they eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, which is true, they just eat those in addition to plenty of calorie dense foods even if ingredients are technically healthy, and they have no sense of portion control. Like my mum easily eats 600g of grapes as a snack (400cal, 75g of sugar) in front of TV and believes this is healthy for her. Or put milk, frozen yogurt, bananas, \"sugar-free\" cocoa power, coconut powder, pistachios, dates, dried apricots and a ton of honey into the blender to make a healthy drink and have 500ml each in one go. This is not how you lose weight. And if I don't drink that abomination of calories then I'm not supporting their weight loss because of of course these must be healthy food and good for you!\n\nSo when I make a salad for myself I stick to non-starchy stuff and don't use oil/mayo/dairy for dressing (usually a fresh lime corriander and apple cider vinegar dressing that I make myself) so I can have a big filling high fiber salad for very few calories. They love salads too, as long as it's drowned in olive oil because of course olive oil is healthy for you! And they have potatoes, pasta, bread and beans in it too, but the bread is sourdough and the pasta is whole wheat, so they must be great. And that's 1000 calories of salad which is just a \"healthy\" side to their meal. So I get criticized for making my salad separately because I'm not going to eat that salad.\n\nSo they began counting calories, but only for the actual meals, as if snacks and sides don't count, or \"healthy\" stuff don't count. So they sum up to 2000 calories a day when in reality it's closer to 4000. \n\nAnd eating times/patterns. I used to always munch on something but one of the changes that I made was that I don't snack anymore. Ever. I did OMAD when I was losing weight and I currently do 16:8 IF with 2000 calories to maintain, that means I don't eat breakfast and this is always an issue with them. They believe not eating breakfast makes you gain weight because you end up eating unhealthy snacks at 10am to keep your energy levels up. Well, I don't eat breakfast and I don't snack, and I have a light lunch (salad and protein). they do eat the breakfast and then they also eat the snack at 10am and they eat a big lunch. So which one makes you gain weight in the end? Apparantly mine. \n\nAnd now they're critical of me because they haven't lost any weight despite \"dieting\" for a whole month and they're blaming my suggestions and their genes, and the conclusion is that I must have better genes that allowed me to lose the weight despite having the same diet! I'm shocked they haven't gained anything after a month of eating like that so if anything that's super genes for not gaining weight. So my sister makes passive-aggressive comments that I can afford to eat something tasty every time I don't eat what they eat and how I'm the lucky one for having the right genes.\n\nDon't even get me started on eating out or ordering food. If I ask to swap potetoes for mushrooms or fries for salads for my own order I won't hear the end of it.\n\nNot sure why I even ranted but I needed to get it out of myself. Any advice about how to deal with this? I know I should move out (I'm saving money to buy a house so staying with family is a big help). I don't want to just tell them to F off because I want to be helpful but they're not being helpful to themselves. And I get that, I used to be like that (not exactly because I wasn't opinionated but I ate what my mum gave me, which is this kind of food so obviously I also looked like they did).\n\nRANT over, sorry.\n\nSo how can I be helpful to them? And how do I keep my sanity?",

Learn to grey rock when they make remarks about your eating, or your weight: [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/grey-rock#other-approaches](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/grey-rock#other-approaches)\n\nBasically treat the topic as though it's uninteresting, and completely doesn't matter. Ignore what they say, change the subject to something neutral, and remain calm, and detached. Yes, what they're saying is absurd and wrong, but you won't get them to climb down from their position, they have to elect to do so themselves. So any talk of \"genetics\" becomes meaningless noise. What about X news headline? Etc. \n\nBe cheerful, detatched, and upbeat. When they bring up something in a negative tone either deflect by changing the subject, or making what you're doing into something you want, because you wanted it, not that you're denying  yourself. When they remark about you choosing mushrooms over potatoes just say you really wanted mushrooms. (I don't know know about you but I'd choose mushrooms too for purely gustatory reasons!)  \n\nIf you refuse to engage on the subject it becomes uninteresting and they'll eventually stop harassing you on the subject. Be aware that their behaviour may escalate at first in an attempt to get you to respond, so be mindful to be detached and calm in your responses no matter how egregious things get because that's the only way to eventually extinguish the commentary. Think of your weight loss as something that happened decades ago to someone else -- it's uninteresting, isn't it? Yeah, that happened, what are people's plans for the weekend? Etc. Ultimately your only choice may be to simply distance yourself a bit -- when you are able to move out -- but making and keeping a boundary (that your weight loss is your business and you don't take input or share information about it with them) should help. That doesn't mean you can't be loving, engaged, and supportive in other areas, but draw a boundary around this. I've done something similar in my own life, and while it's uncomfortable at first when you draw and adhere to boundaries eventually they become natural and normal for everyone involved.",

        "body": "Yeah. See what you did to them was “horrible” from their perspective. ( you totally were not horrible! You are super awesome rockstar taking RESPONSIBILITY for your life and health instead of blaming “genetics”. Go you!)\n\nBut in their view you destroyed their excuse to be obese. The ever comforting and reassuring feeling of “I’m obese but it’s OKKK 🥰🥰 it’s not my fault. Can’t change it if I tried! It’s ✨genetics✨. “And when your whole family is in on it, it feels like family bonding time lollll you assure each other “it’s not my fault”\n\nBecause if it WERE my fault then I’d have to do something about it. But nope. Sweet relief of being a victim 😌😌\n\nAnd you and your brother came in and blew that up! Haha \n\nAgain! Good for you!!! Must have been REALLY hard to break past those limiting beliefs the family put on you. \n\nBut what to do now? From my own experience and therapy I can tell you….The suffering you feel is also “your fault”. Wait! I’m not hating. Hear me out. When something is “your fault” (like eating excessively) it’s the BEST THING EVER as you have the chance to CHANGE IT!!! Yessss!!! \n\nSo what should you change ? \n\nHelping them.  \n\nStop it. Stop it now. \n\nI get it. Comes from place of love. Let me help you. Let me support you. It’s hard but I know the way 🥰🥰 \n\nMy dear OP. that love only works on people who WANT help. They don’t actually want to change for their own motivated reason. They just hate that they feel they must change because you did. From what you’ve written they don’t actually want to lose weight. Honestly they might even subconsciously be trying to prove their point and they don’t realize they’re doing it. Like “look I diet like her and still not skinny. Must be genetics! She just got lucky”. They are trying to go back to the way things were before your bro and you “ruined it for them ”. \n\nLook what they’re doing? Eating healthy food at crazy portion sizes trying to claim its weight loss. Not counting snacks. Using your recipes but making them worse. And then trying to blame you like “we did what you said didn’t work. Oh well! Genetics!” \n\nI find it hilarious that they try to give YOU advice on weight loss (must have breakfast!) when YOU LOST WEIGHT AND THEY DIDN’T?!?! 😂😂 \n\nHonestly I say all this from experience. My parents struggle with weight loss. Very similar story to yours. I’d tell them to track calories. Weigh food. They said no that’s crazy. My parents new “healthy” breakfast idea? Tahini and grape syrup on bread. VERY NUTRITIOUS and healthy. It’s true! It is! Lots of minerals and health benefits. But I did the math it’s like 400-500 calories per slice of toast. \n\nMy mom always says I swear to god I eat nothing. I can’t lose weight. I just gain!! I eat nothing all day. Look. Look what I eat! Only 2 slices of toast for breakfast. A little bit of meat and veggies for lunch. A salad for dinner. That’s it! \n\nWhat she fails to mention is those 2 slices of toast are 1000 calories with toppings. That yes her meals are healthy, but she’s snacking on nuts and seeds and sweets all day. Multiple spoons of honey in her tea. \n\nThe worst part is my parents push THEIR food on to me. Nuts are healthy! Calories don’t count! \n\nYes they are healthy and small portion is ok. But not YOUR amounts. \n\nMy mom goes through a big bag of sunflower seeds every 2-4 days. Healthy right?? Yesterday I calculated for her and each bag is 3000 calories 🙃🙃\n\n“But I don’t eat anything” \n\nSorry. My rant. Back to you. \n\nWhat I realized is it’s my fault trying to teach them how to do it. They are adults. If they wanted to lose weight they would. If they wanted to learn about weight loss they would. If they truly genuinely want to learn from me what I’m doing, when they see me make healthy food or avoid certain things they’d say “wow! I should do it too. If it helps HER it’ll help me” \n\nIf their reaction is to tell the only one losing weight “you’re wrong. Let me tell you how” that’s the biggest 🚩 that they don’t actually want to lose weight. Lol plain and simple. \n\nSo freeeeeee yourself!!!! Stop trying to tell them how. Stop explaining. Just stop talking about it. It’s not your job! The “fault” is in trying to help people who don’t want to be helped. \n\nSet boundaries with them: “how about this. I don’t talk about your food you don’t talk about mine. I won’t judge your food choices and lifestyle and you don’t judge mine. We are all adults. We can decide what we eat and when. New family rule: nobody comments on others meals (what they order, how much they eat, when they eat)”\n\nStrict boundary. Enforce it. They might huff and puff and complain. Stand your ground. You might even get up from table and leave if they start commenting. They’ll be offended at first and say you’re too sensitive etc. “cool 😎 yeah. I AM sensitive. So cut it out or we won’t have meals together” \n\nEventually they will cut it out. \n\nBut in the meantime? Work on YOURSELF to not let the comments bother you. Harder said than done. Understand their comments are more about them, than it is about you.\n\nGood luck!! \n\nSORRY ABOUT THE NOVEL 🥲",

But often you can't start working on your physical health until you're in the right place mentally, even though physical fitness might actually help improve your mental health. Different people react differently to criticism/tough love. To some, it's a wake up call. Some would get motivated by the desire to prove the critic wrong (that meme/tweet about \"you gotta outlive your enemies\"). But for a majority of people, harsh criticism would only make them retreat deeper into their shell. \n\nI agree with you. Most of the reasons people give for being obese are truly excuses. But there is almost always an underlying mental issue. The excuses are the symptoms and they won't go away till the underlying cause is addressed.\n\nIt's very difficult not to wonder why others can't do something when you've managed to do it. I speak from personal experience. I was young, fit, I used to run and swim. I couldn't understand why everyone around me had a pot belly. I told myself, I know the science, I know the drill. I will never end up looking like that or having the health problems that come with looking so. Then I got fat and I found myself saying the same things I had heard others say without any sense of irony. I smoked, I made excuses for why I couldn't quit. I quit cold turkey, stuck to it for 14 months and internally judged my former smoking buddies for not having the small amount of discipline to kick this very bad habit. Again, no sense of irony, or awareness that I had thought exactly this way about overweight people before I became obese myself. Then I fell off the wagon and went back to making the same excuses without batting an eyelid. Well, after about a month of self-loathing.\n\nOur mental issues are unique to us, a \"one size fits all approach\" won't work.\n\nEdit: can to can't",

Staying late 3D printing and things like that, listening to my boring podcasts as I file down pieces of aluminum by hand.\n\nAt night the building cleaning crew comes in and the crew is run by a nice lady from Mexico.  I'm not in a very talkative mood when I'm working but she is an extravert to be sure, so we talk almost every night.\n\nShe owns a rental in San Bernadino, an apartment in Culver City, and just bought a house in Inglewood which her husband and sons renovated.  She thinks the new house, purchased for $600K on credit, is worth at least $850K now.\n\nShe plans to move to the house in Inglewood, and then renovate the apartment in Culver, and then rent that!\n\nInsofar as I know she works 6 days a week, doesn't believe in vacations, doesn't drink alchohol, and is generally worried that robots will replace human jobs.  On Sunday she cooks.\n\nShe's extremely energetic for someone who works an overnight shift, cheerful and spirited, and has no problem with cleaning bathrooms, taking out trash, and mopping floors.  She's funny and makes me laugh, even when I have no interest whatsoever in talking.  She bought me a nice bottle of Wine for Christmas, underling the date on the bottle with her index finger as she smiled, 2017.  She wore a red sweater and red lipstick during the holiday season.\n\nHer daughter graduated UCLA Medical school and is going to be a doctor.\n\nThis lady came here from Mexico in the 90's and worked as a minimum wage cleaner for 10 years.  At some point some people in an Ad agency in Culver City suggested she form her own cleaning company, maybe 15 years ago.\n\nOnly thing is that I pray for her health because I am a foofy new age MF and despise acerbic smelling chemicals other than the ones I need for my work such as resins and epoxies.  Yeesh I need an hour of yoga, 2 glasses of green juice, and some apple cider vinegar just thinking about it.\n\nAnyway, there's engineering middle managers with master's degrees at my company that can't afford a house in LA.

    "body": "There it was again. The tiny raised fist. The giggle. The single newborn digit pointing at the wall behind me. \n\nThe bare, empty wall. \n\nWhen the doctor told my girlfriend Katie that our baby was *‘precocious,’* I had to look the word up in the dictionary, but there’s no doubt about it: Jon was advanced for his age. He was imitating our hand gestures and speaking gibberish months before the nurses, the parenting books, or even the internet said that he should be able to. \n\nWe took it as a good sign. As a young couple who never intended to be parents, we needed all the good signs we could get.\n\nJon’s every cry, movement, or rash sent us diving into a bottomless pit of questions that all boiled down to basically the same thing: *is our baby normal? Is he going to be okay?*\n\nCompared to the struggle some new parents face, waving at the wall should have been nothing. A non-issue. And it would have been–\n\nIf it weren’t for the strange events that always happened *just* before or after Jon waved.\n\n*‘Mishaps,’* Katie called them.\n\nBut I preferred *‘Impossibilities.’*\n\nHow else should I describe a lamp that flings itself across a room, only to shatter against the wall?\n\nA Christmas tree that spontaneously catches fire?\n\nA showerhead that suddenly bursts apart, nearly decapitating our ten-month-old baby? \n\nI was afraid that by the time I was able to prove that the bizarre events surrounding our son were more than just coincidences, it would be too late for Jon. \n\nThe stranger things got, the harder it became to share what I was going through with Katie. \n\nI feared what she would think of my sanity if I told her that the letters in my alphabet soup had arranged themselves into the words ‘*DEATH CHILD’* or if I explained how sometimes, when I was driving out in the country with Jon and fiddled with the radio, I would hear a distant voice inside the static screaming *“kill the baby kill the baby kill the baby”* over and over. The first time it happened I was so horrified that I didn’t notice when Jon waved at something in the trees. \n\nIf I’d been a millisecond slower stomping on the brake, the stag that had charged madly out of the trees would’ve killed us both. \n\nDuring the rare moments in bed together that Jon’s erratic sleep schedule allowed us, I’d lay awake listening to Katie’s deep, peaceful snores and wonder if she, too, had experienced inexplicable things that she was afraid to share with *me.* \n\nOne thing was clear: it couldn’t last. The secrets and constant tension filled our home like a toxic cloud, threatening to destroy our relationship and even jeopardize our ability to care for Jon. \n\nMy girlfriend knew that I was trying: talking to psychiatrists, pediatricians, and even priests…\n\nWhat Katie didn’t know, however, was that I was also considering the services of a psychic. \n\nOddly enough, it was the priest who put me in touch with her. \n\n“You must understand,” Father Keene explained, “that we churchmen are like any other specialized profession. Just as a plumber specializes in pipes or a carpenter in woodwork, we specialize in bringing souls closer to God.” He hesitated then, rubbing the stubble on his jaw like he was having second thoughts about what he was about to tell me. “However, there are…other professionals. With other specializations.” I heard the dry swallow in his throat while he scribbled a phone number on the back of a business card and handed it to me. \n\n*Elsie Knott.*\n\n*Medium. Channeller. Exorcist.*\n\n*Walk-Ins Only.* \n\nThe only psychics I'd ever heard of were late-night TV figures with jangly fake jewelry who promised their gullible supporters everything from lottery winnings to a cure for erectile dysfunction. \n\nI knew Katie wouldn’t approve, but I was at the end of my rope. In fact, on our drive back from my meeting with the priest, Jon had started pointing and gibbering excitedly at something outside the car, something only he could see. I gripped the wheel with white knuckles and felt a familiar sense of doom tighten my chest until I could barely breathe. *What was about to happen?*\n\nI only heard a *pop* when our right front tire burst, sending us careening into the next lane. Only quick thinking by a semi-truck driver saved us both from a gruesome death. \n\nIt had to stop.\n\nAs soon as I attached the spare, I plugged the address of the psychic's home office into my GPS. \n\nForty minutes later, we were still driving through pine trees.\n\nElsie Knott's \"home office\" turned out to be a trailer in a forest clearing at the end of a gravel road. Christmas lights and charms swung cheerfully from its redwood deck, and an enormous garden grew around the remnants of a rusted-out VW bug. A dead ring of what I assumed was salted earth circled the property. \n\nJon giggled and waved at something the moment we got out of the car. \n\nMy blood ran cold–\n\nBut it was only a few white chickens who’d come clucking over to greet us. \n\nI listened to the drone of the cicadas and wondered what the hell I was doing here.\n\n“You gonna stand out there starin’ all day, or come up an’ say hello?” Elsie leaned on the screen door with a tiny fist on her hip. Her short stature, fiery-red pixie cut, and floral-print dress gave her the look of an angry red-headed Tinkerbell. Face to face with the exorcist, it was clear that she was still a teenager. Elsie Knott was barely as tall as my shoulder, and sticky crimson stains covered her apron. “I got strawberry jam cookin’ so we gotta be snappy about this.” \n\nInside Elsie’s trailer, all the lamps had tassels. Portraits of Jesus, Elvis, and Johnny Cash lined the walls. A cat-clock ticked away the time above a dusty T.V. showing reruns of *Magnum, P.I.,* and the only deliverance from the sweltering summer heat came from a fly-taped box fan wheezing away beneath the polyester curtains. \n\n“This was my gramma’s place,” Elsie explained. “Keepin’ it this way makes me feel closer to her. She was the longest-lived one of *us* I ever heard of. Made it to ninety-nine! They got’er while she was gatherin’ mushroom in the woods out back. Crucifix slipped offa her neck.” \n\nElsie swept a pile of magazines off of the glass coffee table, grabbed Jon out of my surprised hands, and began to flip him around like a slab of bacon. \n\nShe looked in his eyes, ears, nose, and throat. Off came his onesie and his diaper. \n\n“Kid’s got rash. Hang on.” Elsie came back from the kitchen with a cloth and a jar of something that smelled like spoiled cider. “Apple Cider Vinegar an’ Aloe Vera. Twice a day.” She buttoned my giggling son back up in his onesie and handed him back to me. \n\n“That’s it?” I gaped. “What about–”\n\n“The way he sees stuff that ain’t there?” Elsie plopped herself into the huge recliner across from me and crossed her bare feet. “Pfft, ain’t nothin’ you can do ‘bout that. Kid’s one of *us.* Just try to protect him, like my gramma did for me. You don’t seem as smart as gramma, though. Kid prolly won’t make it past five…but hey, you can try, right?” \n\n“Protect him? From what?” \n\n“Look, the roof needs fixin’ an’ I got jam on the stove. You want any more of my time, you’re gonna hafta pay for it.” She brought a bright-red nail to her lips. “A twenty oughta do it.” \n\nElsie stuffed the crumpled bill that I handed her into her apron and I followed her to the kitchen, where she carried on with her canning while she talked: \n\n“For jus’ about all of human history, we’ve had mediums, channelers, shamans…people affected by things that nobody else can see. Nowadays there ain’t hardly any of us. Now why do you think that is?”\n\n“Well, modern science–” I began. \n\n“Pffft! It’s ‘cuz *they* kill us all! That’s why!” Elsie’s fists went back to her hips. “Look, there are *things* out there that don’t wanna be seen, or even heard of. They recognize us for what we are, an’ kill us off ASAP…*just like they’re tryin’ to do to your son*. They're smart, though. Don't wanna draw too much attention. That's why they always try to make it look like an accident…unless they get *really* desperate.\" \n\nJon started whimpering. He was getting hungry…and I needed to get back. \n\n“Uhm…” I began, “Thank you for your time, Ms–” \n\n“Don’t you wanna know how to protect your kid?” Elsie demanded. She stormed over to an immense bookshelf that I hadn’t noticed and pulled out a yellowed scrap of paper. “Look, you follow these steps and it’ll stop. When it does, though,” she jammed a tiny finger into my chest, “you’ll owe me *eighty* bucks!” \n\n“What if I don’t pay?” I joked.\n\n“Oh, I dunno.” Elsie gave me a wry smile. “Maybe I’ll put a curse on ya.” \n\n“All I’m asking is that we *try*,” I pleaded with Katie later that night. The circle of salt I’d poured around the house had aroused her suspicions; now she’d caught me nailing an iron horseshoe above the door to Jon’s room. \n\nI still had eleven steps to go. \n\nKatie snatched the paper from my hand. \n\n“I can’t believe you *paid* for this garbage! You do realize we had to put that tire on credit, right? We need formula and diapers, not this mumbo-jumbo!” Katie must’ve seen the crestfallen look in my eyes; her voice softened. “But…I guess…none of this stuff is exactly *harmful* to babies. You know what? Go for it.” \n\nSeven days later, I owed Elsie Knott eighty bucks. \n\n“Do we really have to keep all this up?” Katie waved the list at me over breakfast, her mouth full of pancakes. “On top of *everything* else we have to do?” \n\n“Well it’s working, isn’t it?” I replied. “Jon hasn’t waved or pointed or babbled at an empty room in almost two weeks now. There hasn’t been a single freak accident.”\n\n“It’s just so much to remember,” Katie groaned, “and it’s so *weird.*” \n\nMy girlfriend wasn’t wrong. As a non-Christian, I wasn’t exactly comfortable with both of us wearing crosses all the time. The house smelled like garlic, and it had been *really* hard to find a silver-bladed pocket knife. \n\nThe homemade pancakes I’d cooked up to celebrate our miraculously disaster-free week made breakfast take longer than usual, and Katie was running late for work. \n\nMaybe that’s why she forgot her necklace on the dresser. \n\nIt was a simple thing, just two pieces of iron held together in a cross shape by a bit of silver wire. \n\nBut it was one the more important things on Elsie Knott’s list.\n\nA sense of foreboding seemed to follow me as I drove Jon back out to Elsie Knott’s trailer to pay my dues and learn more about how to protect my son. \n\n“Worked, didn’t it?” Elsie was on her hands and knees, weeding her garden in a gigantic straw sunhat that made her look even scrawnier than she was. “Told ya.” Once again, she stuffed my cash into the pocket of her apron. \n\n“What’s next?” \n\n“There’s somethin’ I didn’t tell ya last time. Half ‘cuz its not that important ‘til the kid starts goin’ out in public more often, and half ‘cuz I didn’t wanna freak ya out too much.” Elsie wiped her hands off on her apron and took a deep breath. “These *Things,* the ones that come after people like Jon and gramma and me…they can get inside people who aren’t protected. They can use’em to hurt your kid. I got another list for ya, here!” she handed me a paper from her apron pocket. “You see anybody showin’ any’a those signs ‘round lil’ Jon here, you kick’em to the curb an’ run, got it?” Elsie tickled Jon a little, wriggled her nose to make him laugh, and handed him back to me with a meaningful stare. “I hope I’ll been seein’ y’all a lot more as time goes on. That’d mean you’re both still alive.” \n\nThere was something sad about Elsie’s goodbye wave as we drove out over the protective ring of salt. \n\nKatie was leaning against the mailbox when we got home. I wondered if she’d locked herself out of the house. \n\n“There’s my precious baby boy!” She smiled and ran toward the passenger-side window with her arms outstretched. I put the car in park and stepped out as she tugged on the car door handle with increasing frustration.\n\n“Uhhh, honey?” I ventured. “It’s locked.” \n\nMy girlfriend snapped her head toward me, her face twisted into an expression of indescribable hatred. \n\n*“Un-lock it, then!”* she snarled. “I want to hold my precious baby.” There was that word again. *Precious.* Katie hardly ever used it. I hadn’t read all of the instructions on Elsie’s most recent scrap of paper, but I remembered seeing something about sudden changes in personality being a warning sign. I looked around. Our quiet suburban street was desolate beneath the blazing afternoon sun. There was just me, Katie, and Jon–who was locked in a hot car. “Open the door, honey.” Katie insisted. \n\nI moved slowly back around to the driver’s side. I tried to keep eye contact with Katie while I fumbled with my key, trying to slip it into the lock without arousing too much suspicion–but Katie’s eyes narrowed like a hungry crocodile’s. Strange eye color, movement, or shape–something else from Elsie’s list. \n\n*“Open the door, honey.”* Katie insisted again. \n\n“Okay.” I agreed–then slipped inside the car and turned on the ignition. \n\nMy girlfriend let out an unholy scream and jabbed the *butcher knife* she’d been hiding behind her back into our brand-new tire. She jumped onto the hood, still shrieking furiously, and went to work on the windshield. A bloody spiderweb crack appeared as Katie slammed her forehead into it again and again. \n\nIt wouldn’t hold much longer. \n\nJon’s crying was deafening in the suffocating space; I unhooked him from his carseat, clutched him to my chest, and covered him with my body as I ran toward the front door of the house.\n\nBehind me, I heard the hiss of our kitchen knife being yanked out of our tire. \n\n*“ARGH!”* Smoke rose from Katie’s skin as she ran into the ring of salt I’d created around our home. My girlfriend flicked her tongue at me like a snake and hissed. *“The child is mine,”* Katie snarled in a voice not her own. *“You know it will happen, sooner or later…so why suffer? Give me the child.”* \n\n“Fuck you!” I panted.\n\n*“We can see to it that you lead a touched, blessed life” –*the thing inside Katie was all smiles and conciliation now that it was trapped outside the circle– *“or we can bring misery to your family for a thousand generations. You have no idea what we are capable of.”* My girlfriend paced like a tiger behind bars, searching for a gap in the salt ring. *“This child is more trouble than its worth. If you will but give me this troublesome thing, we can replace it with another one…a better one…and bring you fortune beyond your wildest dreams. If not…”* The thing inside my girlfriend brought the butcher knife to its throat…to *Katie's* throat. *“Do you think the authorities will believe any of this when they find your girlfriend’s corpse on your lawn?”* \n\n“I…” I hesitated and glanced at Jon, still screaming his head off on the porch behind me. Elsie had already told me the odds weren’t good. Was I really prepared to live like this, every hour of every day, until my child was inevitably killed? I bent over Jon, hugged his tiny frail body to my chest, cradled him in my arms as he wailed. “Okay. Fine. You win. Just let my girlfriend go.” \n\nThe thing inside Katie flashed me a hideous grin as I passed Jon across the salt ring and into its waiting arms. \n\nThat smile vanished when it saw the necklace that I’d taken off and hidden beneath Jon’s blanket when I’d stooped down to pick him up. I looped it around Katie’s neck and yanked her toward me, across the ring of salt. \n\nMy girlfriend’s eyes rolled back in her head. She crumpled to the ground, convulsing, and I barely managed to catch Jon as he fell from her arms. \n\n“W-what happened?” Katie stammered, clutching her forehead.\n\nJon had stopped crying. He was staring at the space where Katie had been standing. If I squinted my eyes, I could barely make out a horrible, distorted shadow clawing at the air in fury–but it was blurry and quick to fade. \n\nBy the time I’d helped Katie to her feet, it seemed to have vanished completely…\n\nUntil Jon giggled, pointed at the empty air…\n\nand waved.   \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

Did Elsie say anything about a familiar? Your child will probably need some sort of spiritual companion to get through life if by only 10 months old powerful demons have gone to this much trouble to kill him. Elsie's grandma lived to 99. I imagine Elsie will give you more of her tips as time goes on. Probably doesn't want to overwhelm you and wants to be sure you fully learn everything before giving you new information. When your child goes to school he will need something to watch over him.",

    "body": "*When I was a little girl growing up in the Sonoran desert—* **RECORD SCRATCH**\n\nGod I hate corny recipe backstories. Here's the best smoky chili ever AND it's actually quick and easy, despite the long ingredient list (scroll to the end of the instructions to see all the \"secret ingredients¹\" I didn't use):\n\n**CHILI ULTIMO CINCO ESTRELLAS**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 5 strips uncooked bacon chopped\n* 1 large yellow onion diced (about 1 cup)\n* 4 jalapeno peppers, diced (deseed if you prefer less spicy)\n* 3 cloves garlic minced (about 1 Tablespoon)\n* 1 lb ground beef (455g) \n* ½ cup tortilla chips, food processed to a powder (1 big handful)\n\nDry spice mix:\n\n* 1 Tablespoon brown sugar\n* 1 Tablespoon chili powder\n* 1 Tablespoon ancho chili powder\n* 1 ½ teaspoons smoked hot paprika\n* 1 teaspoon cumin\n* 1 teaspoon onion powder\n* 1 teaspoon mexican oregano\n* 1 teaspoon cocoa powder\n* ¾ teaspoons ground black pepper\n* ¼ teaspoon cinnamon\n* ½ teaspoon salt\n* ½ teaspoon MSG\n* ¼ teaspoon curry powder\n* ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper\n\nLiquid mix:\n\n* 1 cup beef broth (236ml)\n* ¼ cup ham bone broth² (59ml)\n* 1 cup espresso or strong black coffee (236ml)\n* ½ teaspoon fish sauce\n* 1 tablespoon peanut butter (creamy, not chunky)\n* 1 dried chipotle plus 1 dried ancho pepper, chopped fine\n* ¼ cup tomato paste (66g)\n* 1 Tablespoon worcestershire sauce\n* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\n\nCans:\n\n* 15 oz can dark red kidney beans, undrained (425g)\n* 15 oz can black beans, undrained (425g)\n* 14.5 oz can diced fire roasted tomatoes, undrained (411g)\n* 7 oz can chili peppers in adobo sauce, undrained (198g)\n* 4 oz can fire roasted green chilis, undrained (113g)\n\nAdditional Ingredients:\n\n* 1 cup roast leftover roast (beef or pork), cubed (optional)\n* Preferred toppings, particularly mexican crema (or sour cream), shredded queso fresco (or cheddar) cheese, avocado, and corn chips\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Chop onions and jalapenos, combine, and set aside. Chop garlic and set aside. Prepare dry spice mix detailed above, mix together thoroughly, and set aside. Crumble/process tortilla chips and set aside. Open all the cans and set aside. Prepare liquid mix detailed above (including chopping dry peppers to add to liquid mix) and set aside. \n2. Place chopped (uncooked) bacon in a large pot or Dutch oven and cook over medium heat until crisp and cooked through. Remove bacon to a paper towel lined plate and drain half the grease.\n3. Add onion and jalapenos, stir quickly, and undercook them (thanks Kevin) for just one minute.\n4. Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add beef, breaking apart with a spatula as you cook. Once meat is partially (about 50%) browned, add ground chips and prepared dry spice mix and stir well, cook for about two more minutes.\n5. Add all remaining ingredients — liquid mix with dried peppers, all cans, and your cooked bacon (and optional cubed roast), and stir well.\n6. Bring to a boil and cook 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently.\nReduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, allow the flavors to really get to know each other in the pot. Use the side of your metal stirring spoon to cut any oversize chipotles from the can into smaller bits as you stir.\n7. For best results, let cool and refrigerate overnight. Warm back up the next day and serve. \n8. Serve with preferred toppings (mexican crema (or sour cream), shredded queso fresco (or cheddar) cheese, avocado, and corn chips are a must!)\n\n¹ If you think I have too many ingredients in this recipe, here are other \"secret ingredients\" that I decided against: Guinness beer, miso, celery (wtf), black garlic, cloves, coriander, carrots, onion soup mix, mole, turmeric, soy sauce, red wine, whisky, frank's red hot, marmite, berbere, molasses, cilantro, green olives, olive juice, hominy, italian sausage, cheddarwurst, gochujang, mushroom powder, pureed pumpkin, star anise, dried mint leaves\n\n² Ham bone broth: I do this every Thanksgiving, or every time I buy a ham. It's just a ham bone, plus all the fat trimmings from that ham, thrown into an instant pot and not quite covered with water, and pressure cooked for 2 hours. Basically turns into a jelly-like consistency when done cooking and cooled, I store it in a big pickle jar in my fridge. Keeps for months, through the whole cold season. It's a wonderful addition to any soup or stew (red beans and rice, split pea soup, ramen, lentils, stroganoff, this chili, casseroles, pretty much anything savory). If you don't have this available, maybe don't drain the bacon fat, and maybe add a little more beef broth and a tiny bit of lard or butter. Someone also mentioned Better Than Boullion Ham Broth - that's probably a winner, I love all the BTB products I've tried.",

    "body": "A few weeks back I posted about wanting more info on what the apple cider vinegar was doing for my skin.\n\nSomeone suggested looking up Acetic Acid... the \"active\" component in ACV that ... helps it do what it does. To be perfectly clear, I am limiting this to **BATHING** in an apple cider vinegar bath, not drinking the stuff.\n\nHere are my basic findings that I want to share, maybe you'll find them helpful:\n\n* Since doing a once a week **ACV bath (2 cups of ACV in a full bathtub + Bojack Horseman Episode which is about 45 - 50 mins)**, my BACKNE cleared up because... acetic acid helps clear pores and keep them clear by killing bacteria, promoting dead cell shedding, and softening skin.\n   * My loofah does seem to work overtime after an ACV bath.\n* Since starting this about 8ish years ago, I have gone from a billion products to fix my skin before wearing makeup to...just makeup.\n   * I rinse my face a few times with the ACV bath water, then follow with a light cleanser. This has worked for me.\n   * I also suspect that transitioning away from wearing MAKEUP 6 days a week to just lowercase makeup 2 days a week is a bigger factor in my clearer skin. Poking and putting that much product on anything that regularly is going to mess with your skin.\n* The eczema patches on my legs are very not-noticeable now unless you're really getting up close AND I've worn chafing skinny jeans. Acetic Acid is therapeutic for mild eczema.\n   * Just soak in the damn ACV bath. Pure Acetic Acid is bad for you. If you must, ask your dermatologist about other options to control your eczema. Mine is a very mild case!! There are others with severe eczema and... I am not a dermatologist!\n* Acetic Acid is added to a ton of hair products, and many of these products claim it in helps prevent split ends.\n   * HOWEVER, Hair wise... I haven't been fully paying attention, but I suspect I have fewer split ends these last 8ish years than before. I've gone in for 1 trim a year, and nobody has remarked on my split ends or lack thereof. My hair is really shiny, it's been shiny, it seems to stay shiny, and I use a minimal amount of product on it ANYWAY because I'm largely OK with my hair for the most part.\n   * **Don't put pure acetic acid on your hair.** Just let your hair dangle in your ACV bath water and rinse it out.\n* Acetic acid makes your body odor smell less by inhibiting the growth of stinky bacteria on your skin.\n   * I can't tell you I've noticed an increase or decrease in my personal level of stank. I think I smell OK. But, nobody has remarked on this and I have never taken a whiff of myself and been grossed out.\n* Acetic acid is helpful in promoting skin healing.\n   * ANECDOTAL: before I started regular ACV baths, every mildly concerning cut would result in a slowly evolving keloid. Now I have no new keloid scars. Old keloids have substantially flattened out. This is an observation I made after reading about how acetic acid helps promote the skin's own capacity for healing. I'm  just telling my own observation, I'm not a doctor. A puffy elbow keloid from high school is now a much flatter \"normal\" scar, for me at least.\n   * **Don't go out and buy pure acetic acid, it will burn you**. Just 2 cups of ACV, in a bathtub, and be in the tub for 45-ish minutes, mmmm-K!?\n\nI'm not a fan of consuming ACV... I'm not sure how much benefit people who swear by drinking ACV are getting. It tastes disgusting to me. But I am a fan of BATHING in it 1 to 2 times a week.\n\nSo.. you give it a shot! It's a very low-cost skincare maintenance thing to do. $4 for a full gallon of ACV. I'm not even using Organic Braggs... because I am NOT FANCY.\n\nThe skin all over my body looks great. It's the ONE body issue I am happy to no longer have to \"deal with\" every day and I can wear tanktops and back-showing shirts without worrying like I used to.\n\nYour milage may vary. I am not some ACV savant. I found something cheap that works really well for me, so I  am sharing the news. My skin is moderately oily, if that makes a difference.\n\nFeel free to discuss. Or just try an ACV bath.",

        "body": "My lady regions have been in great shape! Thumbs up!\n\nZERO YEAST INFECTIONS SINCE DOING THIS. In fact, a factor of the ACV bath *regularity* for me was a conversation with my dermatologist who said it could help with frequent yeast infections if coupled with \"responsible underwear\" aka... switching to underwear made of cotton or natural breathable materials, letting the lady bits air out at night, generally avoid wearing synthetic fiber underwear for long periods, and generally avoiding thongs for more than a 4 hours at a time. My gyno corroborated this later on, so it went from \"eh, OK once a month for my skin\" to  \"OH GREAT, this is now a weekly thing!\"\n\nThanks for mentioning yeast infections. It was one of the things that made me make it a *mandatory* regular part of my skincare regimen. Even on vacation, I'll buy a bottle of ACV and take my ACV bath... because who needs yeast infections on vacation?! Amirite?",

Take a warm shower, and periodically spray yourself down with the ACV spray. You  can leave the shower running for steam or not, it's up to you, just let the solution sit on your skin for a few minutes at a time. I've had to do this a few times when the tub was clogged and I didn't see much difference other than it being a 20 minute shower instead of a 45 minute bath. You may need to refill, depending on the size of your spray bottle.\n\nA spray bottle of ACV and water is also good for just spraying your hair with ACV if you want.",

And then I haven't had them since.\n\nI definately credit the ACV baths for this. I did all the other stuff my docs recommended: natural cotton or bamboo fiber undies, letting the lady bits air out at night, less thong use, fewer leggings... and even though I got fewer yeast infections with all that, they still freaking happened more often than I care to remember. The ACV baths put a hard stop to the all of that.\n\nThe other problem is if you keep taking anti-biotics for UTI's and anti-fungals for yeast infections, it throws your whole body out of wack eventually and makes you prone to worse infections. The same meds that kill the yeast in your hoo-haa, also kill the good yeast in your gut. My farts were terrible -- like clear the room -- when I had frequent yeast infections and had to take anti-biotics. My doc said the heavier medications would kill the bacteria that breaks down food in my gut causing stinkier farts. My farts are now.... reasonably farty, in the range of human-tolerable fart probably becauce I have all of my normal gut bacteria.",

    "body": "[NSFW - Boxer Briefs](https://imgur.com/PCleYiJ)\n\nI did it! After decades of never achieving my dream physique, I finally hit my fitness goal!\n\n9 months ago, I decided to fully commit to a goal I've wanted to accomplish since I was 14 years old. Frankly, I was sick of looking in the mirror and not liking what I see - I had a body composition that looked good in clothing, but didn’t underneath.\n\nFeeling that way didn't just affect how I looked in the mirror, but how I felt about myself. Getting that pang of negative feedback every morning and evening, as well as  every time I lost that mental fight trying to resist eating something unhealthy, did no favors towards my confidence. It made me less comfortable around others and - worst of all - it made me lose trust in myself. If I can't accomplish a goal like this that I wanted so bad, what are the chances I can accomplish any other goal I set? That was the worst feeling.\n\nThankfully, I did turn things around - and what a great feeling it is. The person you see on the left is a completely different person than the one on the right. I feel much more comfortable in my own skin and as a result, around others. The fact that I was able to accomplish such a difficult personal goal gives me the faith and patience needed to accomplish others. Other benefits include more energy all the time, I'm mentally more focused, and my anxiety levels have significantly lessened. For the first time in my life, when I look at that mirror, not only do I like what I see - but I'm shocked in disbelief - is this really the same person from just 9 months ago? 9 years? 15?\n\nThe factor that lead to success was patience. I used to try fad diets and workouts only to burnout or injure myself shortly after. Keto was so key in reducing my overall caloric consumption. I've had a massive sweet tooth ever since I was a child and by embracing Keto and cutting out that addictive sugar from my diet was a huge catalyst for change.\n\nMy advice - baby steps. Gradually add exercise, reduce calories as you stall. Find someone who has achieved your goal as an accountability buddy - there are plenty of those right here on this subreddit. Motivation will come and go in waves, this subreddit has been a great anchor for me to get reaffirmed with my goal when I needed it - transformation posts here are so inspirational! Lastly, track everything from your diet to your workouts - data is your best friend!\n\nAlso - for those of you other bachelors who are wondering - yes, getting fit helps open doors in your dating pool. In my experience though, it doesn't help that much in walking through those doors -that's still all on your character and substance :)\n\nThank you so much for reading! If you’re motivated towards making a change, let me know - I am more than happy to help!\n\n**TL;DR -** Started Keto & weightlifting in January, lost 43 pounds and got abs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**\n\n**WORKOUT**\n\nFor those of you asking, I followed the below variation of the PHAT program:\n\n[https://www.anabolicbodies.com/phat-workout/](https://www.anabolicbodies.com/phat-workout/)\n\nMonday - Upper Body Strength\n\nTuesday - Lower Body Strength. Added Hex Bar Deadlifts for volume - 3x8. I added Abs and HIIT at the end. Abs I did 3x10 of weighted leg raises (DB between feet), weighted crunches (holding a DB or Plate above my chest), and Pallof Press (obliques). I hate Planks :). For HIIT - I did Stair master for 20 minutes\n\nWednesday - OFF\n\nThursday - Back/Shoulders Volume\n\nFriday - Legs Volume. I added barbell hip thrusts 3x8\n\nSaturday - Chest/Arms Volume. Added abs and HIIT\n\nSunday - OFF\n\nI worked out in the evenings for the first 6 months. During the last 3 (July - Present), I switched to morning workouts so I can workout fasted, as getting leaner was becoming difficult. At this point, I also added LISST on my volume days, which were 20 minutes of Inc. Treadmill\n\n**DIET**\n\nI did Keto the whole time, but cheated on an average of once a month. I average 1800 calories a day and instead of reducing that as I went along, I used fasting and cardio\n\nI started doing IF - skipping breakfast if I worked out at night, and skipping dinner if I worked out in the morning. All my meals were high protein, medium fat, and composed of lots of veggies. (Chicken/Steak/Salmon with Broccoli, Mushrooms, Asparagus, Avocado, Cheese, etc. Protein shakes after my workouts, which had 50g)\n\nOn my offdays, I did OMAD (Wednesday and Sunday). One big meal for lunch with lots of veggies and one ingredient foods\n\nI had some food substitutes like Quest bars, but I found Quest cookies dangerous for me - they always made me ravenously hungry after and craving real sugar.\n\nI used Erythritol as my go-to sweetener in my coffee, and replaced my sweetened cream with heavy cream.\n\nDuring the last 3 months (July-Present), I started fasting completely on my off days (Wednesday and Sunday) - only having water and drinking 'Health Potions' (Apple Cider Vinegar + Pink Salt in water) to keep my electrolytes up and optimize fat burn\n\nHope this helps!\n\n**WHAT'S NEXT**\n\nI am going to maintain the above throughout October. Ultimately, I want to add a lot more muscle to my frame, so starting November I'm going to reverse diet/bulk. I've been doing IF, so I'm simply going to bring back a 3rd meal - keeping it small and growing it from there, monitoring my weight as I go",

If you can't do bodyweight chin-ups, do assisted chin-ups (with resistance bands) or negatives until you can.\n\nI also found the progressions suggested at https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index#wiki_selecting_a_workout_routine from newbie to beginner to intermediate (depending on your goals - strength vs aesthetics/powerlifting vs bodybuilding) really helpful at least in figuring out a good thing to go to next.",

    "body": "I love my wife. We have been married for 15 years now. She is an amazing mom and partner. She cannot cook to save her life. \n\nI'm not sure why but she seems to have no sense of taste or smell.  So she doesn't care what food tastes like. She also doesn't care how it feels in your mouth.  She will boil a roast until it is cooked through then make up a $2 package of gravy to go with it.  With boiled potatoes and store bought salad.  \n\nI know she is busy with work and the kids so when I am on between jobs I take over the cooking.  I make everything from scratch. I have the time.  So for example instead of microwave pizza I will make pizza in our wood fired pizza oven. Or I will make stuff like pulled pork poutine. That is french fries with cheese curds covered in pulled pork and gravy.  The pulled pork shoulder takes about eight hours to do up.  \n\nThat's what I was making today. I do meal preps for the kids and her when I have time. So I made a really big pork shoulder in the slow cooker with a stout, chicken stock, and apple cider vinegar as liquid to reduce for gravy afterwards. \n\nI took the dogs for a walk while I was waiting for the shoulder to rest so I couldn't of shred it and set aside 2/3 of it for wraps or other lunches.  \n\nShe came home early. And decided to pitch in. She microwaved come fries and just shredded the entire shoulder. She then put the fries on a tray put a few cheese curds on and then dumped the pork and liquid on.  The fries were soggy from it.  \n\nThe kids and I ate it and I thanked her for helping.  And then I asked her for like the hundredth time to please stop helping me cook meals.  \n\nShe called me ungrateful. And said that the food was fine and that she wanted to eat right away.  It would have taken me an hour or so to make up the fries and reduce the liquid to a nice gravy.  \n\nI know she gets jealous when the kids eat my roasted potatoes with mixed roast veggies with gusto but leave half her boiled vegetables on their plates.  I have offered to teach her how to cook better. I have left detailed recipes for her to make simple meals for the kids.  No go, she just can't understand that food is more than just fuel. \n\nI am getting really upset now. It is like she is sabotaging my meals on purpose now. But she thinks me and the kids are just picky babies.  \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit \n\nYes I know I screwed up when I was trying to make the story less recognizable if my partner saw it.\n\nEdit the recipe\n\n\n1 round onion. \n1/2 cup of ketchup\n1/4 cup yellow mustard \n1 small can tomato paste\n1/4 c. apple cider vinegar\n1 tsp. paprika\n1 tsp. garlic powder\n1 tsp. mustard powder\n1 tsp. cumin\n1 quart of chicken stock \n1 can of Guinness \n1 4 pound pork shoulder \nKosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\nFirst sear the pork shoulder on all sides.  You can skip this step but it does add something.  \n\nNext blend everything except the Guinness. Pour the liquid into the slow cooker and add the pork shoulder. Pour the Guiness in on top.  \n\nSet the slow cooker for six hours on high or 10 on low.  \n\nWhen it's done take out the shoulder and let it rest then shred it. I like it chunky so I use forks. If you want an even consistency use a hand mixer. \n\nMix in a little of the liquid from the slow cooker. \n\nTake about half a cup of COLD water and mix it with an equal amount of corn starch. Make sure you get a nice well mixed paste.  \n\nPour all the liquid into a saucepan and set to medium heat. Mix in the cornstarch paste. \n\nGet it to the consistency you like for your gravy.",

It’s honestly been the best thing I’ve ever done for myself. Having a clean bill of health is absolutely priceless, and my confidence has skyrocketed. Feeling so proud and grateful 💖\n\nI incorporated intermittent fasting into my routine—usually eating between 11–7 or 12–6:30—and started walking over 10k steps a day, plus doing at least 30 minutes on the elliptical daily. I drink apple cider vinegar in water before meals, take the right vitamins, and try to walk after I eat. I also stick to a low-carb, low-sugar diet, limiting myself to around 150g total per day (so if a protein bar has 25g carbs and 5g sugar, that counts as 30 for the day). I aim to keep meals around 30–40g carbs or under. I recovered from binge eating disorder after some concerning bloodwork that my doctor wasn’t happy with—and not only have I made him proud, but I’ve made myself proud too. My health was my original motivation, but now it’s my glow ✨ \n\nI am 5’4 and weigh 150 pounds with a goal weight of 115-120. I currently wear a size 8 in jeans and M in tops. 💕",

I’m doing some focus group coding right now actually from interviews with those who were COVID vaccine hesitant, and there have been some interesting themes that I think are worth paying attention to.  We’re still early in the data, but a lot of themes relating to distrust in government and medical institutions have to do with abuse, racism, and condescending messaging.  It’s hard to trust the facts when you have no faith in the sources of the info.  I think more important than scientific literacy (in terms of public health communication efforts) to focus on is actually cultural competence. It’s interesting  for me to look in the mirror as a progressive/agnostic and consider the role of politics.  If liberals think conservatives are dumb, and liberals claim science, and PH/healthcare practitioners can’t speak to rural or conservative folks with humility through a lens that aligns with their values systems, then it makes sense that scientific messaging might feel alienating.  Just spitballing here though!  This is just my conjecture.",

    "body": "Had some friends over this weekend and decided to go all out with a 15.5lb brisket for the occasion. \n\nIt was my first time trying a home made rub, and here's how it went down: I used a jalapeño mustard binder, then coated it with homemade S.P.G. (1:1:1/2 ratio), adding a bit more black pepper because it looked a little light, along with some paprika. Dry brined it in the fridge for 16 hours before getting it on the smoker at 1pm. \n\nFor wood, I mostly used hickory, with a bit of cherry for sweetness. I ran a slightly dirtier fire for the first 3 hours to really lock in that smoke flavor, then switched to a cleaner burn for the rest of the cook. I sprayed it with 1:1 apple cider vinegar ever hour after the 4 hour mark. (I didn’t realize how much time that would add to the cook). \n\nIt smoked for 12 hours total at 250°F, then I wrapped it in butcher paper and finished it in the oven at 275°F for another 2.5 hours. The final temp was 202°F. After turning off the oven, I let it rest for 4 hours, then chilled it in the fridge for another 4 hours. Around 1pm the next day I reheated it at 250°F until it hit 160°F and held it around there until dinner. \n\nAll in all, it was a 28.5-hour journey from start to plate—and it was great. The point was moist and was super Smokey. The flat was just a little drier that I would have liked but was still superb. Definitely the only way I’m gonna do brisket from here on out. ",

    "body": "This time last year I weighed 850lbs  on Jan 20th I decided to start my weight loss journey.   Few weeks prior to that I had made a video of my self making a resolution to lose weight, I had a revalation of sorts and decided to change.  I had gained so much weight that I was unable to catch my breath just trying to go to the restroom. I couldnt stand for longer then a few seconds. and even then my heart would race like I was running a marathon and I would give my self panic attacks trying to catch my breath, which would make it even harder to breath to the point I was in fear of just passing out and dieing right there. \n\nAt the time  I honestly thought I wanted to die, maybe I could be with my daughter again.. but there was something that didnt make sense to me.. If I wanted to die, why was I in panic everytime I was right at deaths door. Why was it I was afraid.. I figured if I was afraid of dieing then I must really want to live, and If I wanted to live I'd have to change.   So thats where the resolution came in.\n\nOn Jan 1st 2023 I made a resolution, Hell I even recorded it on camera for some kind of accountability. I had alredy tried to lose weight a couple years prior lost about 100lbs got down to 600lbs  then ended up giving up and gaining it all back and then some till I got to the 850lbs.  I had become a Diabetic at this point , my entire body was swollen you could put ur finger in my leg or belly and it would leave an imprint that wouldnt go away. I even had a horrible sore on my foot that was spreading over the top I still to this day have the scar over my foot , a dark patch where an open wound that would not heal was. Guessing this is how diabetics usually lose thier feet.\n\nI had no will power or confidence in my self that I could even achieve any weight loss, I had been on Ozempic for two months prior to this for my diabetes and ended up gaining weight on it. It was taking my hunger away, but I had realized I had never listened to hunger in the first place when it came to my eating,  It was more of a thing where you feel like your trying to fill a hole with something like food and it would never fill up is the best way I can describe it. I would wake up and the first thing I would think about is food. I would order so much food that way I could eat it through out the day, never stoping.  \n\nSo Jan 1st I made the resolution and changed my life! nah thats not how it went down I failed the next day after making the resolution and just went back to ordering food, it wasnt till the 20th of that month I had again gotten to the point I was afraid of dieing just going to the restroom. So I decided to give it everything I had to try it and I would start out slowly instead.\n\nThe first week I cut out soda and Stoped drinking any calories. Then I would progress to new rules adding one at a time(eating windows, droping carbs etc. ) I would add new rules that would never be broken, Never drink your calories, never eat other then these set hours, and it would eventually progress into trying a different diet plan each month. So I could see what worked best for me and which things I enjoyed the most out of each diet. I would keep the things that worked well and drop the stuff I didnt enjoy. I started with a normal Calorie Diet Clean chicken breast brocoli and rice,  I was hungry all the time and misreble. \n\nThere were a couple of reasons I didnt document much my first two months,  1 - I didnt even think I was gonna follow through with it This is also why I never took photos of my self.   2 - my home scale only went to 712lbs so It would be such a long time since I'd even be able to measure my weight. not that I could even stand long enough to get my weight in the begining.  My initial weight was taken from a bariatric bed while in hospital so Thats all I had to go off of in the begining till i could actually see my weight on the scale.  by end of month 2 I was surprised and shocked that my scale was actually reading numbers again( instead of ERROR). Infact I didnt believe my weight when I first saw my weight, I had to take it multiple times. My kidneys were killing me those first two months from all the water and swelling I was droping you could push your finger on any part of my body and it wouldnt leave an imprint anymore, My edema was gone all over. I was peeing like 50 times a day and had horrible back pain but It was significant change and I could actually weight my self again so I could measure the difference I was making each month.\n\nThis was a HUGE mental barrier and motivation I had recieved after seeing this. I just thought man Ill go stricter this time and see even more weight loss right? nah haha, it definetly doesnt work that way.  Your biggest gains in weight loss atleast for me, was those first 2 months I'm guessing alot of that was due to my edema all over and the water weight I had on my body.  Reguardless I would continue my journey trying a new meal plan each month. It wasnt till month 5 or 6 I think I took my self off Ozempic and started doing it on my own I was around 650lbs I wanted to make sure I was doing this on my own and what it felt like to not be on the medication so I could make sure I would be able to handle losing weight without it. I Also quit smoking the exact same month, I was chain smoking cigars or Vape Pens and I figured it would be hypocritical of me to continue or use it as a crutch to my eating. Whenever I would fast I would still smoke alot to curb my appetite. So I quit cold Turkey it was actually easier then I thought I think i had like 3 days of cravings then nothing. The first two weeks of geting off carbs was harder then it was to quit smoking.  \n\nThis is where fasting came in to help, I noticed that when Id fast after first 48 - 72 hours I'd have no hunger and it would shrink my stomach to the point my portions sizes were alot smaller when I did eat.  Worked well to transition into this for me since I was already doing eating windows I would just expand and switch to One Meal a Day mostly or Alt Day Fasting. I cycled in different Vitamins and supplements till I found the ones that worked best for me my core supplements that never really changed were the Turmeric, Apple Cider Vinegar, Vit B, D, K, and Magnesium.\n\nCarnivore- I tried Carnivore meal plan month 6 I believe, drinking nothing but water and only eating meat. I noticed such a difference in the way I felt not only was I losing weight the easiest I had ever lost weight and seeing around the same numbers but I felt amazing it made me feel so much better mood wise, I wasnt as depressed and had way more energy. I could also eat until I was satisfied, and never had to measure my food It trained me to listen to my body/hunger cues better.  When you eat food and your hungry it tastes amazing, but as you get threw your steak or steaks, and you fill up the food begins to taste horrible to the point you dont even want to eat another bite. I thought that was really cool and alot easier. I did notice I wasnt losing as much weight when I ate chicken over beef, which confused me untill I began to actually count my calorie intake again. I notice the calorie differences in the two, 24 - 28 Chicken Wings is far more calories then 2 ribeye steaks,  and with chicken wings I seem to be hungry again faster. But I love Buffalo Wings, I could eat air fried buffalo wings every day for the rest of my life, which is why chicken wings are still my go to, along with them being super easy to cook in an air fryer.\n\nCheat Days -   Alot of people dont like em or call them other things.  I enjoy them, they still alow me freedom and alow me to eat off plan for the month aslong as I get back on track the following I also like to see how my body handles certain foods when I eat off plan. I started with like 10 - 14 cheat days then I tried to cut down that number each month.  My biggest problem was making sure I was geting back on the horse afterwards or minimizing how many \"cheat days\", I would allow my self. I would also make sure to not break my other unbreakable rules during the cheat day, so No drinking calories and still utilizing an eating window,  which at this point I was on OMAD, so when I finished eating i would be done with it completly till the next day, since I was fasting regularly like I said my stomach was alot smaller and I would get full easier.\n\n I'm Still working on Portion control This is my weakest point and something I still struggle with daily. I've spent years eating insanely unhealthy portions so when I eat food or make food or order food its always still more then I can eat.. I dont understand why im so afraid of ordering food and still being hungry I dunno where this fear stems from in me but its definetly still there. So for example when I cook my chicken wings  I still cook 24 - 28  chicken wings and throw alot of food away, instead of keeping the left overs. I'm working on that alot lately.  I've never understood the people that go out to a Jack n the Box or somthing and order just one hamburger. It's so funny I hear my self talk about it now and it sounds like an Alchoholic talking about drinking, how they go out and they dont understand just having one beer with a friend, they cant understand it. Why wouldnt you want to have this great feeling all the time. It's kinda the same thing but with food for people like me. I cant speak for others this is just my experience and what I feel.\n\nExcersize - So Around month 6 I began excersizeing and began the physical therapy that I should have done years ago after my Coma. I used Resistance bands straped to the legs of my bed and got adjustable dumbells.  I'm still increadibly unstable when I walk around and I even still fall, but now I can pick my self back up when I do. I'd say my excersize is still minimal thou when comparing to alot of gym rats out there. Very Basic stuff Id say atleast with my experience most weight loss is what you put into your mouth, how much and how often.  I plan on swimming this year and geting a gym membership , then hopfully moving to weights and stuff. I'm right now just still trying to be able to walk for longer then 2 mins without my legs giving out. \n\nMonth 10 - 12 I'm finally able to fit in a car again and travle again, do things like go to a Dr apt instead of having a Dr or Nurse come to me. I can now walk around my house freely still not able to stand for longer then a few minutes but I'm working on it. I'm sure I can fit in smaller cloths aswell since I'm still wearing my 14x shirts, but honestly my skin is still hanging out from my shirts if I wear anything smaller then a shirt that looks like a dress, The amount of skin I have leftover from the damage I've done to my body is going to be significant. I still dont know what I'll be doing about all that but for right now we take it one day at a time.  I lost 400 lbs last year and this year im shooting for about half that, looking to get to 250ish by this Christmas , we'll see. \n\nMy life is still incredibly sad and depressing, dont get me wrong, and I have no illusions that losing all this weight will magically make me happy or will transform me into some story book Happy Ending... Everyday I still miss my baby girl and Every day I wake up to my lonely ass life. But your life doesnt end here It goes on and Life was never fair to start out and its not gonna be fair where it ends up, but one thing I can tell you.  When you survive the perils that life throws your way you will always find moments or times of joy that make it worth it.  I still have a son and if I want to see him make it threw his last 5 years of school and then hopfully college one day Ill have to be alive and healthy for him to do that.\n\nMy best advice I can give to anyone reading this thinking about changing, Dont fall into despair, dont revel in it thinking your life isnt going to get any better so whats the point of even trying, Dont lock your self in a room(Like me) and eat your self to death whatever your food of choice is. And im not just talking about food, for me it was food, to others it could be something else. That thing that takes you away from your pain for a lil while, gives you an escape. Your life is full of possibilities I promise you. Just take the first step and try something, then the next day take another step... untill you look back and realize you've walked miles from where you first started.  No one ever believed I could do it, most said id never lose weight unless I had bariatric surgery. You can do anything you put your mind to. In 5 years I hope I'm atleast back in school in my 40s maybe trying to become an RN or something. Everyone still tells me I cant do this.  I dont know if thats even possible for someone like me but I have a goal. I take one step at a time everyday trying to rebuild my life from ashes. You never know, You might surprise yourself.\n\nI did.\n\nHeres my weight tracking for the year.  I also try to post once a month on tiktok for accountability. havent done this month yet but im sure ill do it sometime.\n\nTake Care Yall , Love the Journey more then the Destination and you wont regret it.\n\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@keebla2](https://www.tiktok.com/@keebla2)\n\n1/20/23  850                                        \r  \n\r  \n3/5/23   712        - Home Scale stops at 712 \r  \n3/11/23  699\r  \n3/17/23  688       - Low carb transition to dirty keto\r  \n4/05/23  683\r  \n4/11/23  671\r  \n4/14/23  665\r  \n4/21/23  657       - dirty keto start\r  \n4/28/23  659\r  \n5/11/23  640\r  \n5/29/23  620       - clean Keto  start\r  \n5/31/23  618\r  \n6/5/23   618\r  \n6/12/23  612\r  \n6/16/23  608\r  \n6/20/23  607      - Start of Carnivore  buffalo wings and ribeyes\r  \n6/25/23  603\r  \n6/29/23  599\r  \n7/8/23   591\r  \n7/13/23  588\r  \n7/18/23  583\r  \n7/20/23  580      - Carnivore  just eatting chicken wings -  no cheat days.\r  \n7/25/23  578\r  \n7/30/23  574\r  \n8/2/23   570\r  \n8/11/23  563                            \r  \n8/15/23  563                          \r  \n8/20/23  563     -  Carnivore just eating Ribeye steaks  80/20 Cheat days included Barbacoa street tacos x3 and Wingstop wings x2 and 1 Day of Pizza and Icecream you can guess which week.\r  \n8/23/23  557\r  \n8/25/23  549\r  \n8/28/23  543\t\t\t       \r  \n9/4/23   538\r  \n9/6/23   536\r  \n9/13/23  549\r  \n9/17/23  544\r  \n9/20/23  535      -  Carnivore Beef and Chicken again with Alternate day fasting thrown in the mix\r  \n9/22/23  530\r  \n9/23/23  526\r  \n9/27/23  527\r  \n9/30/23  521\r  \n10/1/23  518\r  \n10/4/23  515\r  \n10/11/23 511\r  \n10/18/23 499     - Carnivore minus cheat days (3 Cheat days - Wingstop)\r  \n10/25/23 498\r  \n10/31/23 492\r  \n11/6/23  486\r  \n11/17/23 481\r  \n11/20/23 479\r  \n11/22/23 476     - Ketovore/fasting  (Carnivore with some Veggies in the mix) \r  \n11/29/23 483\t - After thanksgiving entire week of cheat days from leftovers\r  \n12/3/23  480\r  \n12/6/23  473\r  \n12/13/23 470\r  \n12/20/23 457     - Carnivore, Buffalo wings mostly with lil beef in the slow cooker ( Cheat days included All New Years Week ate out every day for 8 days includes Hamburgers, Pizza, BBQ, Fried Chicken)\r  \n1/7/24   469\r  \n1/10/24  464\r  \n1/17/24  448\r  \n1/20/24  446",

    "body": "Whenever I accidentally consume onions because a restaurant failed to tell me a salad has it or I eat at a family member's house because they forgot about my allergy (I trusted them to remember it), I get the worst fucking stomach pain imaginable. Like my intestines are getting titty twisters. It lasts for hours and ruins my sleep for that night because the pain is so unbearable I can't sleep.\n\nWell today, I took a bite out of a tuna sandwich from someone who knows about my allergy, but forgot, then remembered it after already mixing the onions with the tuna and mayo. They went in and removed all the little pieces of onion they could find, but they missed some. And still served it to me. The damage was already done. And it was all on me for trusting people to respect my allergy.\n\nThat familiar bubbling pain started flaring up. I knew I was fucked for the next couple of hours.\n\nThen I remembered reading somewhere online about apple cider vinegar easing someone's symptoms from onion allergies. I said, \"what the hell.

I marinated the chuck for 16 hours, then seared it, added one yellow onion, beef broth, worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, salt, fresh cracked black pepper, chili powder, garlic cloves, and thyme sprigs, then set to low for 12 hours. With about 2 hours left, I then added baby red potatoes and peeled, chopped carrots. On the 12th hour, I removed the chuck roast, onions, potatoes, and carrots from the slow cooker and set aside. Now I made gravy using the drippings/remaining broth. First I strained it to rid it of thyme sprigs and other scraps. I then used 3 cups of the drippings/remaining broth and put it on the stove in a skillet. I skimmed the oil and set to a medium-low heat to simmer. While being brought to a simmer I took 3 TBS of the broth out and mixed it in a small bowl with 2 1/2 TBS of corn starch until evenly mixed. Then, when brought to a simmer, I added the starch slurry and whisked until thickened for an amazing, rich, flavorful gravy. Words cannot describe how amazing this was. I’ve had many pot roasts, and all pale in comparison. ",

Japanese has a more peachy/salmon color compared to the whitish USA one.\n2. Japanese is thicker texture and holds shape compared to the USA as its more watery and slumps down on itself.\n3. Totally different flavor! Japanese has a tang/kick -brightness to it while USA one is more eggy and blander.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: No they are not the same and ingredients matter.\n\nEdit: I have come to learn that Costco sells Kewpie that is manufactured by the same USA company but has different ingredient list which contains MSG! Thanks u/Anfini !\nI’m not going to buy a family size Kewpie to compare and instead I will take Anfini’s opinion to heart and believe it’s not great either.\n\nCostco ingredients: SOYBEAN OIL, EGG YOLKS, WATER, DISTILLED VINEGAR, SALT, RED WINE VINEGAR, APPLE CIDER VINEGAR, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, MUSTARD FLOUR, SUGAR, CALCIUM DISODIUM EDTA, NATURAL FLAVORS\n\nUSA ingredient: SOYBEAN OIL, EGG YOLKS, WATER, DISTILLED VINEGAR, SALT, SUGAR, MUSTARD FLOUR, RED WINE VINEGAR, YEAST EXTRACT, NATURAL FLAVORS\n\nJapan ingredient list: VEGETABLE OIL (CANOLA OIL, SOYBEAN OIL), EGG YOLK, VINEGAR, SALT, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, SPICE, NATURAL FLAVOR",

Put a thin coat of light soy sauce over the whole thing and seasoned liberally with the rub.\n4. Bottom side, after trimming\n5. Trimmings in a tray, totaled 4.375lb (so net 8lb brisket on the smoker)\n6. Arrangement of the charcoal (B&B briquettes with hickory lumps) in the OKJ Bronco\n7. Brisket goes on the smoker. Rub was a mix of 3 parts salt, 3 parts pepper, 1 part garlic powder, and 1 part paprika with a bit of cayenne thrown in.\n8. Photo is six hours in, when I pulled the brisket to wrap it. To this point, I was spritzing with a 50% dilution of apple cider vinegar every 45min (or thereabouts). Temperature in the smoker was pretty well controlled throughout, always between 215 and 245, save for a few minutes when it spiked to 250 before I wrangled it back down. Meat was reading 173F / 165F when I pulled it.\n9. Back on the smoker after wrapping and pouring on the tallow cooked out of the cuttings. Smoker leveled out at 235 about 20min after closing it.\n10. After another ~2.5hrs, brisket was reading internal of 193F/198F. I couldn’t really tell if it was probe tender through the paper, but went with it. At this point, it was 5am and I wasn’t expecting the crowd until noon, so I set the oven to 170F and tossed the brisket (still wrapped) in.\n11. Final product, after a total of 6 hours in the oven, 1.5hrs in a cooler wrapped in a towel, and 20min in the cooler but with the lid open. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever. Made some burnt ends with the uncut chunk that were absolutely divine. (Why would anyone not use the moist side for burnt ends?!)\n\nIn total, it was 16.33 hours as follows:\n- 6 hours in the smoker, unwrapped\n- 2.5 hours in the smoker, wrapped\n- 6 hour hold in the oven at 170F\n- 1.5 hour cooldown in the cooler wrapped in a towel with the lid closed\n- 0.33 hour cooldown in the cooler wrapped in a towel with the lid open\n\n\nI wish I’d taken more (any) photos before and after trimming. I feel like that was the worst part for me. Before we actually sliced and ate, I was VERY concerned that (1) I’d taken off too much meat (35% net weight removed!) chasing an “aerodynamic” form and/or (2) I’d not taken enough off the fat cap. I’d love any/all feedback I could get on that side.\n\nOtherwise, my only complaint was that the rub was a bit too salty. In the future, instead of 3:3:1:1, I might go for 2.5:3:1:1 or so.",

I hated the pictures of me in Vegas at my graduation - I looked pregnant. So I finally figured out the discipline to do something about it. \n\nI started by going to the gym and doing cardio 4-5 days a week, burning at least 300 calories a day running. The first day I was practically shaking with fear at being judged by all the meatheads and gym rats and could barely run a mile in 12 minutes. I didn’t stop. 3 months later my 5k time is around 30 flat. \n\nIn terms of diet, I didn’t change the composition of it much. I bought some low calorie snacks like fruits and rice cakes. The only things I cut completely are sugar drinks like fruit juices and sodas as well as beer and wine. Instead, I focused on calories. I had been eating way, WAY more than I really needed to feel full and have energy throughout the day. I stopped eating until I felt stuffed and started eating modestly for a girl of my height, 3 square ~550-600 calorie meals a day. No ice cream late at night. \n\nI drink coffee with a tablespoon of milk once or twice a day and occasionally have some apple cider vinegar to curb late night cravings. Don’t know why that works but it’s pretty effective. \n\nIt’s been 13 weeks and I’ve lost 13 pounds. My ideal would be to lose 10 more. And for the first time, I believe it can do it. I am strong enough. I don’t need to eat to feel emotionally satisfied. What I need is to be healthy and not get diabetes like all of my grandparents did. ",

It's very filling, very healthy and pretty cheap, especially if you grow your own parsley\n\n\n1 can of chickpeas, rinsed\n\n\n1 bunch of parsley, chopped up (about a fistful if you don't squish it)\n\n\n1 handful of cherry tomatoes chopped up to the size of the chickpeas (or 1 whole tomato if you don't have cherry tomatoes)\n\n1 cucumber, quartered, de-seeded and cut up to the size of the chickpeas\n\nA few green onions chopped up, about enough to fit in your fingers if you make the ok sign 👌 if you don't have green onions, red onions are a great substitute.  \n\nThe juice of one lemon or lime, whatever you prefer.  You could also use vinegar if you wanted to.  Apple cider vinegar would be best, IMO\n\n\n\nSalt and pepper to taste, I recommend going heavy on the pepper\n\n\nSometimes I add chopped up garlic\n\n\nI leave out the oil, but I'm the kind of person who likes to eat lemon wedges.  If you don't like to eat lemons straight, you'll probably want to add a tiny bit of olive oil.  \n\n\nMix all that stuff together and put it in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors enhance \n\n\nIt's a filling, refreshing meal.  Perfect for hot summer nights when you don't want to cook.",

I use a benzoyl peroxide wash of 4% (10% can be drying and irritating and is as effective as 4%) in the morning, and at night use adapalene lightly all over my face after washing it with a gentle cleanser (cerave hydrating cleanser) AND after moisturizing with a light moisturizer (cerave moisturizing cream, I apply to a damp face and let it set for about 3mins) as my skin is sensitive and gets irritated by adapalene on its own.... I got rid of my sebaceous plugs after about a month of consistency. Now my acne is under control, I occasionally I skip adapalene and use an OTC retinol or a alpha-hydroxy acid toner that contains salicylic acid at night.\n\nIt is best not to combine these ingredients willy-nilly which is why I use benzoyl peroxide in the morning and adapalene at night. Here is a dermatologist on which ingredients to not combine one after the other: https://youtu.be/Ma_BKA8iV9k\n\nI have acne prone skin too, btw.

    "body": "Warning this will be a long post, it has everything I've learnt in the past couple of years from hair growth, to styling, to weightloss, to nervous system regulation and more.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, I have 3B hair, tall, two years ago I was obese, prediabetic, I had anxiety problems, now I'm just a tall \\[seemingly ;) \\] effortlessly pretty black girl and I want all my beauties on here to have my beauty secrets.\n\nTopics discussed:\n\n* Haircare\n* Style\n* Makeup \n* Teeth\n* Skincare\n* Weight loss vs Fat loss\n* Healthy Fat loss\n* Body Recomposition \n* Inflammation\n* Gut Health\n* How to lower androgen/testosterone levels\n* Nervous System Regulation/Stress Management \n* Tea Cycling\n* Seed Cycling \n\n# Hair\n\nI have PCOS so it affects my hair growth and causes hirsutism, basically male patterened facial hair and male patterned baldness.\n\n**Hair Growth:** Here is the true secret sauce to hair growth, stimulating your scalp. I do daily scalp massages with a bamboo brush (even the bristles are made of rounded bamboo) very gentle. This is the one I use: [Golab Beauty](https://golabbeauty.com/products/organic-bamboo-scalp-massager-hair-brush)  I do short strokes which prevents any tangles. Morning and Night. I then go in with a scalp serum, I use The Oui scalp serum but it costs a pretty penny. In the first yearish I used (The 'Ordinary' Haircare Growth Set Multi-Peptide Serum For Hair Density) which worked wonders and was cost effective. At nights I seal with any scalp oil that has rosemary oil. Sadly Mielle's formula no longer works for me, but As I Am rosemary oil has been working, I also like the Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Hair and Scalp Drops. For Washing my hair I suffer from sebaceous dermatitis which causes scaliness. Paradoxically my scalp is so oily which is what triggers the ezcema and develops the dry patches. Reversing my PCOS symptoms fixed this but what also helped was the Nizoral shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole. It's harsh so I do it once to twice a month at most and I always follow up with a moisturizing shampoo, and of course finish with a wash out conditioner & leave in conditioner.\n\n**Hair Retention:** This is the info we all know about preventing breakage but I'll include just in case. Hair growth happens in the scalp like said before but to retain that growth it's important to wear protective hairstyles (especially while asleep), a silk/satin bonnet or wrap, silk/satin pillowcase, do not let your hair air dry at night. There is debate about this but I've seen hair specialists and scientists say our hair is especially fragile when wet (especially curly/kinky hair). Therefore, we are much more prone to snags and breakage while our hair is wet. So going to bed make sure your hair is dried. If you're air drying your hair during the day try not to touch it too much  - as little manipulation as possible. Personally choose to diffuse/blow dry my hair and this has prevented most of the breakage I was previously experiencing. Lastly, moisturize and oil your ends. I won't pretend like I know which order is best or even if it's important but I've found that using hair moisturizer/diluted leave in conditioner then hair oil works best for me.\n\n**Hirsutism/Facial Hair:** Spearmint essential oil. I add 1-2 drops of the oil to my moisturizer each time I put on my moisturizer and it helped A LOT with reducing my facial hair. I also drink a lot of spearmint tea. Spearmint specifically has been proven to lower androgen/testosterone levels which is why it helps. I also took supplements which I'll include at the end because they served multiple purposes. Be sure not to add the oil to the entire bottle because that will ruin your moisturizer's formula. Just add the drops in your palm/finger tips and mix in your face cream each time you moisturize your jawline, chin, underneck. Also, do this after moisturizing the upper part of your face without the oil because it's harsh and the scent can be irritating to your eye area.\n\n**Body hair:** Personally I sugar wax my arms and legs, the hair has grown back so thin now. I make it myself and follow tutorials from abetweene on youtube.\n\n**Hair colour/Hairstyle:** This will depend on your face shape and color season. I'm a dark winter colour season and I have a heart face shape. I used the Dressika app to discover my color season before I could afford to get myself professionally assessed and I got the same results. Just be sure to use natural lighting, like by a window. Once you have your colour season you can choose hair colours that work best for you (although natural almost always works best). For my hairstyle I try to choose styles that compliment my heart shaped face. I used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with figuring this out.\n\n# Style\n\nI think most of us know about **Kibbe and colour seasons.** This was how I upgraded my wardrobe. I'm a soft dramatic so I wear things that work for my tall height and accentuate my waist.\n\nThis was the game changer with colour seasons. Most of us know about our true seasons, but it can get restrictive. Sister seasons and colour dissonance is also helpful to know.\n\nMy colour season is dark winter, so my sister seasons would be dark autumn and true winter. Thid gives me more wiggle room to style myself.\n\n**Dissonance** are colours that are outside your true season and your sister seasons, you sprinke this in to add interest. Think of an outfit that is extremely matchy and cohesive but has that one accessory or item that stands out and adds interest. It's really fun in art and in fashion.\n\nFor my **shoes** I've started wearing dancing heels which help my flat feet lol and look stylish. Heel insoles help too, as well as the product Shoe Gummi. I still can't last more than 2, 3 hours at most but it's definitely bearable compared to before.\n\nMatching pajamas and loungewear. You just feel so luxurious dressing up at home and they can (should) be comfy :)\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* I wear glasses that work with my heart shaped face.\n* I have a neutral leaning warm undertone so I wear gold jewelry, if I wear pearls or other gem stones I mix in gold to provide more harmony with my skin.\n* Perfume, wear what works with your body chemistry. Some smell delictable on people I know and icky on me, and vice versa. Wear what works for you.\n* Nails, press ons. So convenient, so cheap.\n* Hair accessories, bows, barretes, clips, scrunchies, a ribbon, you could be wearing jeans and a t shirt but a simple hair accessory upgrades the look automatically.\n\n# Makeup\n\nI used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with finding eye looks, brows, blush placement for my face shape\n\nI have a low visual weight face and I am a romantic ingenue, because of this I go for more subtle looks that emphasis two facial features maximum at a time (eyes, lips, cheeks).\n\nDon't get me wrong I love glam bold makeup but soft and subtle makes me glow, I turn heads when my makeup is done like this.\n\n# Teeth\n\n* Wax free floss (Cocofloss $10 expensive but I love it 😅, Burst black floss, Moon graphite floss, Twice floss, Dr. Jen’s silk floss)\n* Oil pulling (coconut oil with clove & tea tree oil, or Guru Nanda oil pulling product)\n* Brush teeth\n* Tongue scraper (not everyday, couple of times a week and not too hard)\n* Alcohol free mouthwash (TheraBreath)\n* More so related to my lip area but I try to use wrinkle preventing straws or when I do use regular straws, I place it on the side of my mouth. The reason this works is because puckering the lips excessively causes smokers lines/wrinkles around the mouth. \n\n# Skin\n\nSkincare. This was something that took me a while to work on because of my PCOS, age, weight and etc.\n\n**Facial Care:** The basics includes chemical exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover. I cycle my nightly skincare routine with this in mind and always keep the same morning routine. Mornings look like this (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, vitamin c/peptide serum, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, finish with sunscreen).\n\nMy nights I alternate these routines in this order\n\nNight 1 - Chemical Exfoliation (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, glycolic/lactic acid, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire face, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\n*Repeat Night 1 - 3 (sometimes I need more days to recover if my skin is sensitive or acting up, do what works for you personally)*\n\nOther things that I've done/used to help: red light therapy (helps with both hair growth, so I use it on my scalp, and with stretch marks so I use it on my face and body), Microcurrent device (helps with collagen production and stretchmarks) - I use the brand NuFace & NuBody, Volufiline (a skin serum I mix with eye cream that helps with hollowness under the eyes, Kigelia Africana Skin Cream (I use the brand Maelys B-Perky which contains this ingredient and helped to tighten my chest area and my loose skin on the area),  face yoga and myo fascia face massage, these help with the tautness of my face (basically everything else helps with wrinkles, these exercises and the microcurrent helps and prevents, sagging especially jowls). I follow tutorials I search for from youtube.\n\n**Body Care:** Similar to facial care body care includes exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover\n\nNight 1 - Physical Exfoliation (Dry brush/Body Scrub, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, retinol body wash, retinol body lotion)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\n*Again, repeat Night 1 - 3 use more days for recovery if needed*\n\n**Stretch marks/loose skin:** Whether due to weight gain, pregnancy, etc. we can't ever truly get rid of loose skin or stretch marks but moisturizing the skin and derma rolling can help with the appearance. Especially derma rolling. Do NOT derma roll while pregnant but you can do so after when you’ve recovered and talk to your doctor (if you've had a c section you have to wait before derma rolling). I used this video as motivation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A)\n\nFor the body I never went beyond 1.5mm it worked for my deepest stretch marks. If this is too aggressive 1.0mm still works just as well. Make sure you use 70% alcohol as this is what experts say is better at disinfecting. It has more water, which helps it to dissolve more slowly, penetrate cells, and kill bacteria. The disinfecting power of rubbing alcohol drops at concentrations higher than 80%-85%. Make sure you disinfect the derma roller before and after use, and make sure you disinfect your area of contact before rolling as well. Do not do heavy workouts workout or sweat inducing activities for at least 3 days after and avoid harsh products.\n\nI started derma rolling while working on losing weight (at the beginning of my journey while still obese) and continued a year after losing 130lbs. Derma rolling works by causing micro tears, the skin heals the area and in the process of doing so develops more collagen - leading to thicker skin, lighter stretch marks and tighter skin. Since I did this before losing the weight it helped my skin adapt a lot. I won't pretend like I have 0 loose skin or stretch marks but it's barely visible. Someone has to be intimately close to notice. Obviously genetics, how slowly you lose the weight, diet, and moisturizing the skin helps but my PCOS contributed to low collagen (thin skin) and so the derma rolling really helped.\n\n# Weight loss vs Fat loss\n\n**Tons of info here but I promise if you read through it helps to know this stuff.**\n\nWeightloss comes down to calories in versus calories out. I know that's rudely simpliflied and not that easy, but it truly is the answer to **weightloss** (which may be fat, water, or muscle). This is why people can eat barely nothing, lose weight but their shape stays the same (basically skinny fat). It's also why fasting or going low carb works so fast (water weight is the first to go).\n\nFatloss on the other hand is more complicated. This involves our TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).\n\nTDEE includes: Resting/Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Metabolic Equivalent of Task or Exercise activity thermogenesis  (EAT), Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), and Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT).\n\n**BMR (\\~70% daily energy)** the energy taken to exist, so tasks like breathing. Your sex, body composition (muscle to fat ratio), age, and genetics play a role in this  \n**EAT (\\~5% daily energy)** the energy taken for exercise weight lifting, swimming, high intensity walks, etc.  \n**NEAT (\\~15% daily energy)** the energy taken for non exercise movements like walking, fidgeting, showering, standing, etc  \n**TEF (\\~10% daily energy depending on the macronutrients of your meal)** the energy taken to digest, protein has the highest TEF of all the macronutrients, Carbs have a TEF of around 5-10%, while Fats have the lowest TEF, around 0-3%.\n\n**Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT)** is the changes in energy expenditure (energy used) that occur in response to changes in energy balance. For example when you eat more food than you need, your body may increase energy expenditure to prevent weight gain eg. move more, eat less the next day, etc.. On the other hand, when you eat less food than you need, your body may decrease energy expenditure to conserve energy and prevent weight loss eg. less movement, eat more the next day.\n\nOther things that affect AT include diet composition (eg high/low protein, high/low carb, calorie dense foods, etc), physical activity (eg. weights vs. cardio), and environmental factors such as temperature and altitude.\n\nThings that influence AT can make weight management challenging, as it can lead to plateaus or rebounds in weight loss efforts. This is why lack of sleep, hormonal issues, aging, etc. makes weightloss harder.\n\n*Here is a clearer example of this*\n\nThings that affect calories in:\n\n* 8-9 Hours of sleep (Maintains metabolic homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, hormonal processes). Compromised sleep lead to:\n   * Increased Gherlin (hunger hormone - feeling hungrier & therefor eating more)\n   * Decreased Leptin (sensation of satiety - needing to eat more to feel full)\n* Insulin resistance: This is when the cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from your blood. This results in excessive sugar in the blood & as a result the body produces more insulin in order to try to help the cells obtain the energy from glucose. This leads to weight gain as the insulin increases hunger. Also, since the body is insulin resistant, the excess glucose is converted to fat for long-term storage.\n   * Things that can cause insulin resistance: PCOS, Inactivity/sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, poor sleep habits, high cholesterol levels, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, high bodyweight, acromegaly\n\nThings that affect calories out:\n\n* Body Composition (Fat to muscle ratio) \n* Gut health\n* Compromised sleep affects our energy levels which leads to\n   * Decreased NEAT (Non exercise activity thermogenesis)\n* Hypothyroidism (lowered levels of T3 and T4)\n   * Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 affects every cell and all the organs in your body by regulating the rate at which your body uses calories/energy which is known as our bmr, meaning this affects your metabolic rate.\n* Too few calories lowers daily NEAT\n   * By eating below your BMI (calories needed to perform basic biological processes), your body makes up for this through energy conservation by lowering your NEAT (non exercise activity thermogenesis). Basically you lack the energy to perform your normal daily activities. This also affects your body composition and cardio health as you become sedentary (stop moving as much).\n\n# Healthy Fat loss\n\nSo to lose fat in a healthy way you need to:\n\n1. Get enough sleep (8-9 hours per night)\n2. **Manage your stress levels/nervous system regulation**\n3. **Look after your gut health**\n4. **Manage inflammation**\n5. Increase your daily steps (8-10k per day)\n6. **Weight lift**\n7. **Eat high protein (protein takes the most amount of energy to digest).**\n8. **Manage your insulin resistence**\n9. **Eat in a caloric deficit (make sure your calories in do not exceed calories out).**\n\nFuther information about the bold items in the list is included below. Also, I know this all seems overwhelming but keep in mind you are creating a lifestyle change. This is not a quick fix. \n\nTo **manage your insulin resistance** (info from the book Glucose Goddess by Jessie Inchauspé):\n\n* Eat within an hour of waking up\n* Protein with breakfast\n* Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before each meal (diluted in a glass of water)\n* Eat foods in this order, veggies -> protein -> fat -> starches -> carbs -> sugar\n* Never eat sweets/dessert/carbs on an empty stomach (dessert after dinner)\n* Keep refined carbs and added sugar at a minimum.\n* Minimize alcohol intake\n* Try to minimize sodas, fruit juice and sweet drinks (this is because there is no fiber to help with the glucose spike or at least try to have these drinks after eating something fiberous)\n* Only eat fruit whole, not transformed eg. eat the orange instead of having the orange juice, again fiber makes a world of a difference\n* Put clothing on your carbs. Eg. have protein/fats/fiber with your carbs\n* A short walk after carb heavy meals\n* Fasting - this is controversial and I should add a disclaimer, if you in any way shape or form have or had an eating disorder, especially restrictive eating, I highly recommend against fasting. Intermittent fasting has a lot of studies out there that were done on men. The book Fast Like a Girl by Dr. Mindy Pelz includes a nuanced view of fasting that takes into account our hormones and our monthly cycle. She also has a free app 'Fast like a girl', you log your period and it tells you how long to fast. However, bioindividuality is key here, genetics, etc. Please if you are considering fasting make sure you get bloodwork done first. Manage your electrolyte levels, do not neglect iron and protein levels. Personally, I prefer using the other methods since fasting can also inadvertently worsens insulin resistence due to increased stress/cortisol which cause higher hunger cues. Some with insulin resistence found fasting to be helpful. So make sure you do what works for you and always consult your doctor. \n* Supplements:\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n   * Inositol\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\nTo eat in a **caloric deficit**, calculate your TDEE and subtract 200-500 calories from that number. I like using this calculator.   \n[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net)\n\nEg. If it's calculated to be 2000 calories, you subtract 200, so 1800 should be your daily calorie intake. For the activity levels make sure you do not oversell yourself. Here is a general guide:\n\n* Sedentary: Office job sat all day or less than 3000 steps per day\n* Lightly Active: Exercise 1-3 times per week or 3-10k steps daily (up to 3-4 miles daily)\n* Moderately Active: Exercise 3-5 times per week or 10-15k steps daily (up to 4-7 miles daily)\n* Highly Active: Hard exercise 6-7 training days per week or 15-20k steps daily (up to 7-10 miles daily)\n* Extremely Active: Intense daily exercise/hard physical labour 7 days a week or 25k+ steps daily (up to 10 miles daily)\n\nAs you lose weight your body adapts so after a while you may need to recalculate your TDEE and deficit. Once you are at your ideal weight, you no longer subtract the 200-500, you simply eat the TDEE amount to maintain but you do this gradually. After I lost the weight I came out of the deficit by adding 50 calories to my daily intake per week, till I was at maintenance/my TDEE. This prevented me from gaining fat or water weight.\n\nLastly, muscle mass (increase in muscle raises your metabolic level, meaning you burn more calories at rest). This is ideal and is also how you'll see someone who is short, seemingly small but weigh more than you imagined. Muscle density weighs more than fat. Think of a 50 pound dumbbell versus 50 pounds of feathers, you would need a whole lot of feathers to match the weight. Same difference, you need a larger volume of fat to equal to the same amount of muscle. Therefore, lifting weights is ideal because you will become more toned, burn more calories at rest, be able to eat more even when you've lost the weight to maintain your phisique, you'll be more insulin sensitive, and you will have stronger and higher bone density (really important for women, we lose up to 5% of muscle mass per decade after the age of 30).\n\n# Body Recompositon: Weightlifting for health (and aesthetics), lose fat & gain muscle\n\nIt is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. I followed Huskular Goddess and and LexiiGettingFit for inspiration and they were really the ones that opened my eyes to the concept of body recomposition (gain musle while losing fat). \n\nThe benefits of this is as you're getting smaller your TDEE is increasing. This means by the time you lose the weight you'll still be eating an adequate amount. The other benefits include insulin sensitivity versus insulin resistence, higher metabolism, and a improved body composition like I mentioned before in the dummbell versus feather example. The downside is the number on the scale won't have a dramatic shift while your clothes will be fitting looser. Again, weight density plays tricks on us and it's easy to get caught up in body dismorphia but I promise it works. \n\nIn order to sustain and build muscle while losing fat, you need to be consuming enough protein while remaining in a caloric deficit. So 60-80g of protein per day minimum to lose 1-2lbs per week. Ideally it should be 0.8-1g of per pound of lean body mass. Eg, someone is 300lbs and they want to get down to 150lbs. They would eat 120-150g of protein per day. If this is too much, try to get at least 60-80g like I mentioned before. Remember even though 1-2lbs per week sounds small, the changes are significant because of the muscle gained. You will look and feel smaller.  \n\n**Weightlifting for a rounder booty** (I reshaped my glutes by weightlifting. Hormones can actually affect the shape and my PCOS did a number on me. I developed a V shape over the years. Round, square, heart, A shapes are all based on your bone structure and fat placement. Some of us just have those stubborn fat deposits in certain areas that are genetic, even when we lose the weight, it's a smaller version but the same shape. V shape on the other hand is largely seen in older women post menopause and in younger women with hormonal disorders. This is becuase the hormonal imbalances also causes muscle imbalances. Regulating your hormones helps but it won't grow the muscles for you, so I used Fit With Emely's glute guide based on your glute shape (completely free, I watched all her videos to get this info and it took me two years to go from a V shape to a round shape.\n\nHere is the guideline for each shape:\n\n**Glute Maximus** - Everyone should be working on glute maximus. It builds the shelf and overall size. Step ups (all variations), hip thrusts (all variations), lunges, rdl, leg press, all squat variations  \n**Glute Minimus** - (V and Square shapes), this muscle fills in the middle between the top and lower glute. Hip abduction, single leg bridge, Standing hip abduction/cable raises  \n**Gute Medius** - (Heart, Round, and A-shaped) this muscles builds a longer hip for top portion of the glutes. Eg. Single leg squat, Single leg deadlift, Cable clamshells, Reverse lung, step ups  \n**Underbutt** - Everyone should be working on underbutt but this is especially useful for V shaped folks. It works the hamstrings and lower portion of glutes. Good mornings, single leg rdl (also works minimus), single leg hip thrust (also works maximus), hip abductors (also works minimus)\n\nHow to structure workout:\n\n* Warm up/Dynamic Stretches (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body warm up or upper body warm up, etc.)\n* Compound exercises (2-3 exercises eg. single leg rdl, good mornings, leg press - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets). That probably sounds like a foreign language to some, so for instance:\n   * **Start excercise 1**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 2**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 3**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n* Secondary Workouts (2-3 exercises eg. step ups, bulgarian split squats, lunges - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets)\n* Isolated/Accessory Movements: these exercises work one part of the muscle more than others, for example an overbias on the underbutt/hamstring like I mentioned before to help with the V shape ( eg. hip abductors, kickbacks, glute bridge, lying leg raises, etc. (1-2 exercises high repetitions, low weight 2-3 sets, 15-20 reps, 1-2 minute rest between sets)\n* Static stretch/cool down (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body cool down or upper body cool down, etc.)\n\nKeep in mind that you only need to work on a muscle group 2-3 times a week. So I only do glutes Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Also keep in mind while I work the lower body I am also working my upper body (eg. while doing rdls I am lifting the weight with my upper body), which is why I don't have tailered upper body days, this is for aesthetic reasons, and because weightlifting more than 3 days per week is not feasible with my PCOS. \n\nMy full routine is:\n\n* Monday- lower body\n* Tuesday - Pilates/core\n* Wednesday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n* Thursday - lower body\n* Friday - Pilates/core\n* Saturday - lower body\n* Sunday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n\nI also used primarily resistance bands in the beginning because gym equipment intimidated me (not anymore :) ). I started with 25lb resistance and went up to 125lbs. I use the product BandBar which allowed me to use the resistance bands like a barbell at home. This isn’t the only option and you can definitely buy resistance bands and do it without the bar. [BandBar](https://shopbandbar.com)\n\nFor the ab separation from being obese, I did this workout 3 times a week (also helpful post pregnancy): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0)\n\nFor my chest to help with getting perkier boobs (the derma rolling was what made the biggest difference, but this exercise helped as well though it took 6+ months for the changes to be significant. Women tend to take longer to grow chest muscles): [https://youtu.be/hg7\\_R29jGIE?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/hg7_R29jGIE?feature=shared)\n\nI also did workouts to help with my posture and mobility 3 times a week (any I could find online)\n\nThe last thing I will say is be mindful that you may gain weight initially when you start lifting weights. This is due to slight inflammation/water gain from foreign tension, which will last about a month or two before you adapt BUT your body will adapt, I promise. Keep in mind if it's days before your period or if you are on your period. It's not if, but when, our weight fluctuates. As long as you are in a deficit and doing everything right, the number will go down. Do not get discouraged!!!\n\n***Here is the edit to this post which includes my supplements, how I managed my inflammation, and how I improved my gut health. I also edited the information I shared prior to include a few more tips and lifestyle changes I made, and included a few more details. I also rearranged things so there is a separation between style/hair/skin and health information. The post is getting really long so I may create a separate post for personal development/mindset tips.*** \n\n# Inflammation\n\nIn my case my inflammation was caused by my PCOS, insulin resistence and my obesity, but it can be caused by chronic stress, other autoimmune disorders like IBS, Crohn's disease, etc, smoking/alcohol, age related diseases, environmental toxins, diets high in processed foods, sugars, trans fats & high omega-6 fatty acids. \n\nIn my case the inflammation from the PCOS led to gut inflammation due to the high levels of coritsal (stress hormones) in reaction to the high testosterone and insulin resistence. I also experienced metabolic inflammation (non alcoholic fatty liver disease), skin inflammation (as I mentioned earlier the ezcema on my scalp, alopecia, and hirsutism), adipose tissue inflammation, chronic low grade inflammation (this led to edema or fuid retention -> insulin resistance and my high testosteron/androgen levels also exacerbated this).\n\nTo fix this these were the thin I added to my life:\n\n* Dry brushing 2-3 times a week\n* Body Gua sha\n* Face Gua Sha or Face Yoga or Myofascial Massage \n* Jump Rope\n* Trampoline/Rebounder\n* Vibration Plate (very useful for after a workout or while sitting down)\n* Acupressure mat\n* Arvigo (Mayan Abdominal massage) & Lymphatic drainage massage\n* Leg elevation, I sleep with a pillow under my knees. In the evenings I keep my legs up.\n* Massages\n* Sweat more (exercise/sauna/steam room)\n* Portable Infrared Sauna (reduce cortisol by 25%)\n* Microcurrent\n* Compression socks\n* Castor oil pack 3-4x per week\n* Eliminate inflammatory triggers (mine were gluten & dairy)\n   * Switch to sourdough\n   * Eliminate seed oils\n   * Avoid alcohol & smoking\n* Supplements\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n* Teas that helped\n   * Turmeric\n   * Red Rasberru Leaf Tea\n   * Fennel\n   * Chamomile\n\n# Gut Health \n\nYour microbiota needs the right bacteria in the right amount to perform its hormone regulating functions properly. When the type or number of bacteria gets disturbed by events such as stress, or poor diet, or your gut can no longer accomplish its job meaning you'll have inflammation, increased risk of chronic disease, skin conditions, mental health issues, weakened immune system, nutrient absorprion problems, and weight management challenges.   \n\n\nFor weight loss issues, gut microbiomes influence hormones in producing and signaling leptin and ghrelin (these hormones regulate hunger and fullness signals). Inflammation and insulin resistence is also associated with gut health problems as mentioned before. Energy extraction from foods, certain gut bacteria are more efficient at extracting energy from food, particularly carbohydrates. When there is an imbalance, more calories can be absorbed from food leading to difficulties gaining or losing weight. \n\nThings I did to improve gut health/intestinal permeability:\n\n* Ate foods rich in digestive enzymes (mangoes, pineapple, etc.)\n* Pre and probiotics (incorporate bifidobacterium and lactobacillus)\n   * Favorite brand: Seed Heath Probiotics\n* Pickles (without vinegar): Great source of prebiotics\n* Apple Cider Vinegar/Kimchi/Kombucha/Sauerkraut\n   * Beware of certain types of vinegar contain chemicals which kill bacteria, “the good bacteria”, and leave the yeast Candida albicans alone.\n   * Raw apple cider vinegar contains: Natural probiotics (friendly bacteria), which may help with your immune system and gut health.\n      * Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (diluted in a glass of water) before each meal\n   * Balsamic vinegar: Acetic acid is the active compound in balsamic vinegar. This acid contains strains of probiotics that aid digestion. The probiotics found in acetic acid can help promote good gut health and digestion while supporting overall immune function.\n* Raw Carrots (has the type of fiber that binds and flushes out toxins in gut, good to have as daily hormone & digestion support)\n* Limit Processed foods and Sugar\n* No drinking or smoking \n* Stress managment (which I'll expand on just below)\n* Increase fiber intake\n* Regularly exercise\n* Supplements\n   * Ginger \n   * L-Glutamine\n   * Olive leaf extract (especially helpful if you have candida overgrowth)\n   * Turmereric \n* Teas\n   * Ginger\n   * Lemon Balm\n\n# Lower androgens/testosterone\n\n* Teas \n   * Nettle Tea\n   * Spearmint tea\n* Spearmint oil topically for hirsutism\n* Supplements\n   * Schisandra (adaptogen - stress management & hormone balance)\n   * Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n   * Inositol\n   * Holy Basil\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\n# Nervous System Regulation/ Stress Management \n\nStress is one of the things that age us the most, and people with PCOS already have higher levels of cortisol so these are the things I do to manage my stress levels:\n\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, direct sunlight upon waking up. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Same bedtime everynight (pre midnight)\n* Invert screen colors at bedtime (red filter on screens)\n* Pillow under knees\n* No loud alarms\n* Magnesium biglycinate supplement before bed\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, view the sunset before bed. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Spend a few minutes breathing through left nostril only\n* Epsom salt foot soak\n* Journal\n* Get back to using my coloring books (I even invested in alcohol based markers it's so fun). Regulates me and gets me in touch with my inner child\n* Time with friends, my puppy, and my family\n* Supplements\n   * Holy Basil (adaptogen - stress management & hormonal balance)\n   * L-Theanine\n   * Magnesium biglycinate \n* Teas\n   * Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen - stress management, also good for menstrual cramps)\n   * Reishi Mushroom\n   * Lemon Balm\n* Night time mocktail (have after dinner and not on an empty stomach due to the sugar levels in the tart cherry)\n   * Teaspoon of tart cherry (high levels of melatonin)\n   * Magnesium biglycinate powder\n   * Probiotic soda (good for gut health)\n\n# Tea cycling\n\n- On your period\n    - Nettle leaf: Increase iron levels\n    - Moringa: Increase iron levels\n    - Red Raspberry leaf: Helps with period cramps (best to drink throughout the month, especially at the end of the luteal phase\n    - Chamomile: Helps with wellness wind down routine when you're feeling extra tired\n- Follicular phase\n    - Focus teas: Peppermint, Spearmint\n    - Adaptogens: Lion's mane, Adaptogen latte, and Chaga mushroom\n    - Detox: Dandelion Root\n- Ovulation phase\n    - Detox: Dandelion root tea\n    - Bloating: turmeric tea latte/golden latte\n    - Estrogen dominance - symptoms (bad hormonal migraines, hot flashes, nausea): Schisandra berry, Lemon balm\n- Luteal phase\n    - PMS symptoms: Raspberry leaf, Schisandra berry, Ginger root (powder or tea)\n\n\nThe best teas for PCOS\n\n- Spearmint\n    - For reducing androgens & lowering hirsutism (facial hair)\n- Cinnamon tea (improves insulin sensitivity)\n- Chamomile tea (Adaptogen)\n- Nettle Tea (reduce androgens)\n- Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen/stress relief, also good for menstrual cramps)\n- Schisandra (adaptogen/stress relief & hormone balance)\n- Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n- Ginger (ginger offers anti-inflammatory, fertility and hormone-balancing benefits, aides digestion )\n\n\n# Seed Cycling\n\nWhat is seed cycling? Seed cycling refers to the consumption of specific seeds at different times of the month in order to improve the production and levels of sex hormones, specifically estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.\n\nSeed cycling divides the female menstrual cycle into two parts:\n\n1. During the first half of the menstrual cycle, or days 1 through 14, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **flax and pumpkin seeds.**\n2. During the second half of the menstrual cycle, or days 15 through 28, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **sunflower and sesame seeds**\n\n*Results from seed cycling will not happen overnight. Normally women observe improvements after approximately three months of seed cycling adherence. It took me about 4ish months.*\n\n**The Benefits of Seed Cycling:** Support hormonal balance, alleviate PMS symptoms, decrease hormonal acne, alter irregularity of menstrual cycles, and fight stomach bloating and fatigue.\n\n",

        "body": "I guess I should create a second post about this but in a not so short answer 😅, it changed everything. This may be taboo to say but a lot of racism is tied in to fatphobia and don’t get me started on how differently you’re treated when you’re a woman that’s black, bigger and tall versus being black, bigger and short. \n\nMen used to pick on my height and deny me my femininity, now I’m treated and even told I’m like a model. Do not get me wrong they fetishized me before and negged me a lot. Now they objectify me but the objectification (meaning pretty girl, that’s all they see and of course sexual objectification which all women experience) is also paired with negging at times. Since I work in the STEM field, they get surprised that this tall black girl, fixing her lipgloss with her hello kitty decorated kindle is smart 🤯 go figure lol. That’s what brings on the negging. \n\nI will say that men no longer judge me if I’m out and about, and dressed a little messy. Like if I’m in sweats, braids, and wearing a scarf, I’m seen as effortlessly cute. Before I would have gotten nasty looks and been called lazy. There is a crux to this though, if I’m too underdressed I will get the lazy comments and ugly looks. Like if my hair is undone because race still very much plays a factor in biases and stereotypes. Compared to my white friends I still have to put a bit of effort into my - I’m so busy I have to rush out the house for a quick trip to the store - look. \n\nHowever, I have also had great experiences with men and at work. I get more respect, I’m taken more seriously in the office. It’s easier to find professional clothes (still expensive), but not selling my house for a suit. The men in the office knew me before so there’s a level of comfortability and respect there. I do notice some flirting and ogling sometimes though. I kinda expected it because I’m the only woman of colour in the office. \n\nI get more gifts and sweet talk from men. If I’m being honest my vetting system makes it so I’m not easily impressed. The difference I noticed for most men (there are still some genuine ones I’ve stumbled upon), is that when you’re overweight they treat you well in secret and neg you in public. Whereas, it’s the opposite when you’re thinner (or conventionally pretty), they treat you well in public and neg you in private. It’s kept me grounded knowing that this is partly societal and cultural, so I have to me intentional about not getting swept away by free perfumes or purses or even being offered to be taken on a weekend ski trip. Currently I’m dating someone that is generous, sweet, attractive, a little younger than me, and very much holds the same values as me when it comes to politics & society. He’s dated bigger women before so I know he would have loved the woman I was before this journey. I am so happy that I didn’t let the immediate changes that occurred after my glow up sway my decisions and that I held out for him.\n\nMy family treats me differently. I’m no longer the one they say wait don’t eat that or inspect my plate during family functions, they also don’t bring up my weight in every conversation, though they do ask for advice a lot. \n\nHealth and looks wise my inflammation made it so I was not only larger, but I also wasn’t very cute as a bigger girl, I say this because trust me there are some great looking bigger women out there that keep up with themselves. Once the inflammation went down, my features were more prominent. My nose, feet, and hands got significantly smaller.\n\nI am able to do more now. My anxiety is gone and I can go on adventures. I think this is the biggest change. I love the freedom to be my true self without judgement, scrutiny, and especially from myself (meaning held myself back a lot - I was truly my biggest hater at times), not anymore. Life has changed in a lot more ways and like I said I may create a separate post to expand on this. Thanks for asking :)",

Also, my skin is incredibly sensitive so while sugar waxing has worked for me, shaving darkens my skin and causes hyperpigmentation.

    "body": "There is a whole wide world of [different beans and legumes](https://nutritionrefined.com/cooking-legumes/), from the humble navy bean stewed down to maximum heartiness to the elegant black lentil tossed in a lemon and dill vinaigrette topped with poached salmon. Unfortunately I see a ton of people just dumping some beans out of a can onto a plate and wondering why their McDonald’s cued palates can’t stand them. My dudes, beans are a staple in nearly every culture and they didn’t get that way by unseasoned tinny chalk balls. Here’s how to bean.\n\n**Selecting Beans**\n\nBeyond skipping over the canned when you can, not all dried beans are created equal. While they have a super long shelf life in regards to safety and not inculcating anything that would give us a food born illness they have a shelf life of about one year max in terms of quality. This means that the dusty bag on the bottom of the shelf in a suburban grocery store full of non bean eaters might do you wrong unexpectedly. Cooking will take longer, they may never actually get creamy, you may have a lot of withered “floaters” that never soften. Your best bet (in the USA) is to hit up stores that cater to Hispanic populations or vegetarians. Bulk bins are a great sign but not 100% necessary. A Mexican grocery store near me has bulk bins of pinto, black beans, and occasionally mayocoba as well as fresh(!) chickpeas on occasion. A trip to whole foods or a natural food store will net me cannelini beans or great northern beans and a whole rainbow of lentils that even when buying fancy pants organic are still cheaper than almost any other food staple. Have an Indian or Ethiopian grocery store near you? Stock the heck up, and grab spices while you are there. More on that later. The only beans I really buy at big box supermarkets are ones that have them stocked near the middle height of the shelf (spots reserved for higher turnover items) and bags of 15 Bean Soup.\n\n**Bean Prep**\n\nOnce you have your beans look them over a bit before you cook them. A quick rinse in a large bowl of water to get any dust or dirt off, make sure there are no small stones mixed in, and toss any withered up floaters you see.\n\nI have taken a lot of [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's](https://www.seriouseats.com/editors/j-kenji-lopez-alt) great research and food science to heart and he and Daniel Gritzer have a pretty exhaustive  [bean guide](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/03/how-to-cook-dried-beans.html) up on Serious Eats if you want the chemistry but the short take away is you only need to soak thicker skinned beans, soaking can take away some of the quality variability if you don’t know if the beans are fresh, soaking can leach away flavor and nutrients of thin skinned beans like black beans, and you should cook your beans with salt.\n\nIf you are soaking you want to put your beans in a large container like a bowl or a Cambro, and cover them with cold water that is about twice their height. If you have an inch-thick layer of beans you want two inches of water above them. Let them sit 8 to 24 hours then cook them up.\n\nDon't add acid until after cooking, and if your tap water has a low pH to where you find beans don't seem to get tender you should cook them with a smidge of baking soda. Start off with half a teaspoon per pound of beans in order to not effect the flavor too much, and adjust as needed to figure out hour much you need depending on how hard or soft your water is. (Most people will not have to adjust their water pH though, this is just outlier troubleshooting.)\n\n**Bean Cooking Methods**\n\nMy Granny knew what was up with pressure cookers. And now that they are improved so much with new model stove top ones and electric ones like the Instant Pot where the risk of blowing beans into your ceiling is negligible it’s one of the best investments for any home cook, even outside of the bean diet. If you don’t want to get one though you will need a large pot with a lid on the stove or a dutch oven in a 250F oven with the lid slightly offset.\n\nPressure cooking lets you skip soaking without consequence more than any other method, even with older beans. You don’t have to worry about evaporation while cooking. It gives you the maillard reaction throughout the liquid unlike a dutch oven which only accomplishes it on the perimeter (and not at all with the slow cooker), and it’s fast. With an electric one you automate the entire process as well.\n\nPressure cookers allow less evaporation so you will want your bean to water ratio to be less than other methods but soaking comes into play. I’m about 900 feet above sea level. For soaked beans I cover them with one inch of water above the level of the beans, for unsoaked I cover with two inches of water. If you are at a higher altitude unsoaked beans might require more water. For pots and dutch ovens two inches over soaked beans and three inches over unsoaked will be adequate.\n\nTiming will depend on the bean and the method. Smaller beans cook faster, soaked beans cook faster. They’re done when they are creamy inside and firm outside with few exceptions such as red lentils. THe best way is to just check the package or google what type of bean for which method you are using.\n\n**Bean Seasoning**\n\nHere’s the real rub for me and my real inspiration for writing this. Y’all under season your beans. Entire wars weren’t fought for spice trade routes just so people could forget what a bay leaf was. Your basic template for flavors is going to be Aromatic + Cooking Liquid + Acid. I know it sounds like a lot going on, but frequently one ingredient can cover multiple elements and just two our of three elements will take you far.\n\n*Aromatics*\n\n* [Charred onions](http://pho-recipes.com/how-to-char-onions-for-pho/) or [caramelized onions](https://www.essentialomnivore.com/instant-pot-caramelized-onions/)\n* [Mirepoix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IsiEQRZUuc) or trinity\n* Minced garlic and/or ginger\n* Fennel\n* Herbs such as bay leaves, rosemary sprigs, thyme sprigs, sage, cilantro, parsley, oregano, epazote, tarragon\n* Spices such as cumin, cloves, cardamom, turmeric\n* Spice blends such as garam masala, Cajun seasoning, Indian curry powder blends, BBQ rubs, Berebere\n* Chilis. Jalapeno, serrano, dried guajillo, canned chipotles in adobo, hatch chilies, canned diced green chilies. Just chilies.\n\n*Cooking Liquid*\n\n* Stock or broth is bare minimum. Get Better than Bouillon or a similar concentrated stock paste if you don’t want to make your own but if you ever buy a rotisserie chicken you should really try making your own. I’ve used miso paste before when I had nothing else on hand.\n* A few shakes of  [Liquid Smoke](https://www.thespruceeats.com/liquid-smoke-overview-335486).\n* Canned diced tomatoes (with or without chilies)\n* Some shakes of [Fish Sauce](https://redboatfishsauce.com/) AKA Nam Pla\n* A bit of Worcestershire\n* A glug of wine\n* Some beer (maintenance mode)\n\n*Acid*\n\nOnce it’s *finished* cooking a little acid can go a long way. A splash of vinegar, a squeeze of lime or lemon, hot sauce, buffalo sauce, and suddenly the dish has new heights and depths.\n\n*Bonus*\n\nA bit of [chorizo](https://www.caciqueinc.com/products/ranchero-pork-chorizo/). Nduja. Some thick smoked ham, or even a bone from a smoked ham. A few sausages. A smoked turkey leg. Tasso. Andouille. A few slices of diced bacon. If it’s meaty and salty and you don’t have enough to make a meal of it use it as a flavoring agent in beans.\n\n**Storing Cooked Beans**\n\nFridge ‘em for 5 or 6 days without issue in a covered container or freeze them. Beans freeze wonderfully and you can bulk cook these, put some in a quart ziplock bags and freeze them up to 6 months. This is a great way to cycle through different flavors or types if you are getting burnt out.\n\n**Bean Flavor Combos**\n\n* Black beans + bell peppers, onions, garlic + bay leaves\n* Black beans + onions + orange peel + all spice\n* Black Beans + cumin and onion + cilantro + lime\n* Pinto beans + onion and jalapeno + cumin and epazote\n* Pinto beans + bacon + canned green chilies\n* Pinto beans + chorizo + cilantro\n* Pinto beans + dried chilies + tomatoes + unsweetened cocoa powder + cumin + smoked meat\n* Pinto beans + dried guajillio peppers + leftover smoked meat + apple cider vinegar\n* Pinto beans + bacon, onion, serrano + can of diced tomatoes + bay leaf, cilantro\n* French lentils + garlic, onion, celery + herbes de provence\n* French lentils + caramelized onions and bay leaves + white wine vinegar\n* French Lentils + dill and tarragon + lemon juice\n* Red beans + Cajun seasoning + fish sauce\n* Red beans + trinity + bay leaves + tabasco\n* Red beans + Cajun sausage + collard greens + vinegar\n* Great Northern beans + diced tomatoes + oregano and basil\n* Great Northern beans + Italian sausage + apple cider vinegar\n* Great Northern beans + mirepoix and garlic + chicken thighs + parsley, bay leaf, cloves + bacon\n* Great Northern beans cooked with oregano and fish sauce, drained and mixed with olives, artichoke hearts, lemon juice\n* Great Northern beans + diced tomatoes + dill, parsley, oregano, hint of cinnamon\n* Chickpeas + diced tomatoes + fish sauce + liquid smoke\n* Chickpeas + diced tomatoes + curry powder + ginger and garlic\n* Chickpeas + bacon + dried chilies + lime juice\n* Chickpeas + garlic and cumin + tahini + lemon juice\n* 15 bean soup + Old Bay + sausages + spinach + lemon juice\n* Red lentils + cumin, ginger, and garlic\n* Red lentils + diced tomatoes + cumin, garlic, and cilantro\n* Red lentils + onion, cumin, turmeric + serrano pepper\n* Red lentils + onion + curry powder\n* Green or brown lentils + jalapeno + turmeric, garlic, ginger + diced tomatoes\n* Green or brown lentils + mirepoix + berbere + lemon juice\n* Green or brown lentils + berbere + ginger and garlic + fish sauce\n* Green or brown lentils + mustard powder + diced tomatoes with chilies + lemon juice\n* Mung beans + mirepoix + ginger, cumin, jalapeno + lime\n* Mung beans + diced tomatoes + trinity + kale\n* Navy beans + ham bone + bay leaf and onion\n\nGo forth and bean.",

Follow the package instructions, presoak, bring to boil etc.  but when it comes time to turn down to simmer, put the covered pot (oven-proof of course) in a the preheated 250 degree oven for the amount of time you were supposed to simmer on the stove.  \n\nUse 250 degrees for first hour and 225 degrees for any additional time.  \nAlso works for meat stews.",

Doing so will toughen the skins and make the interior mealy. Hold the acids - tomato, lemon, sour orange, balsamic, whatever - in reserve until after the beans / peas / lentils are fully cooked. In fact, adding a bit of baking soda to the cooking liquid  - 1/2 tsp per dry cup of beans /quart of water - in order to make it slightly alkaline will help to break down cell walls, hasten the cooking process by nearly half, and give you a more palatable result.",

Rice is a food staple for more than 3.5 billion people, and rice and beans are a culinary backbone in many households. \n\nRice and beans are a complete protein because each contributes what the other is missing. They are highly valued in areas where animal proteins are hard to obtain and expensive. Rice and beans also provide ample B vitamins and minerals, such as magnesium and potassium. \n\nHere are some other facts about rice and beans:\n\nRice\nRice is adaptable, accessible, and affordable, so many people eat it regularly. The American Heart Association recommends that adults consume six servings of grains per day, which can include rice. \n\nBeans\nThe U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommends eating about 1-3 cups of legumes per week.

It got so bad that I consulted multiple doctors and a gastroenterologist. I was prescribed PPIs and basically told my only option is to treat my symptoms. No mention of a microbiome, no other ideas on why I could be experiencing this.\n  \nAfter a few months on PPIs I started developing  a rash over my whole body. No doctor could give me a good answer of why it was happening. One night while doing my own research, I came across the video of a guy saying that most people who struggle with acid reflux actually have too LITTLE stomach acid, not too MUCH as I thought. It’s a condition called hypochlorhydria, and it is made worse by PPIs and antacids. All of the symptoms he described matched mine perfectly, and I realized the rash was an auto immune reaction to the condition. My mind was blown. Everything I thought was actually the opposite— the stomach needs to be super acidic to digest food, and when it’s not, the digestive system doesn’t work properly and you end up having reflux. \n\nI stopped taking PPIs cold turkey (not recommended), and my acid reflux was worse than ever for a few days. I started taking betaine HCI and digestive enzymes with meals as well as Seed probiotics with green power and L-glutamine first thing every morning. I also try to take apple cider vinegar when I remember. I’m feeling so much better and my stomach feels like it’s slowly healing. I take a little baking soda instead of antacid when I have bad reflux, but it has gotten so much better. I have a whole new perspective on my stomach and it makes me mad that no doctor had any advice other than PPIs. \n\nThat being said— why is low stomach acid as a condition not common knowledge?? Feels like a pro pharma conspiracy to me. ",

Everything i was eating had one of those three items in it. Come to find out, Canola oil was just approved by the FDA for human consumption right around the time i started my GERD and IBS symptoms. If i eat anything with Canola oil or the two dyes in it, i can feel it burn as it goes down my esophagus, it burns for about an hour and proceeds to bring on the GERD whilst it sits in my stomach, and then without fail, the next day i get the 8 hour long crampy shits. Canola oil is processed with Hexane, lye, and then bleach and is steamed in between these. Red dye #40 is a petroleum distillate that’s a throw away so they just HAD to find a good use for it (feed it to us) and blue #1 is coal tar. I’ve pretty much eliminated these three things in my diet and my GERD and IBS are all but gone. Not really an “allergy” but more like a chemical burn reaction imo.

    "body": "TL; DR: FAT MAKES YOU FULL. 350 to 199.\n\nIn July 2017, I was morbidly obese (at 6'3\", 350) and on the fast track to diabetes. I switched doctors because, having put on so much weight, I was ashamed to go back to the last doctor I'd seen. I made a deal with my new doctor: \"Never give me any bad news, and I'll do whatever you say.\" What he said was, \"When you're ready, cut out sugar and starch.\" We agreed I'd start November 1 - after getting in the last of my Halloween candy.\n\nI didn't get the full-fledged keto flu. I just had some cramps the first week. Stupidly, I drank some tonic water (which, without the quinine it used to contain, doesn't even work for cramps). Little did I know I'd just consumed that first week's worth of carbs in one glass. Oh well...\n\nI had lost 100 pounds a few times before through unsustainable exercise and caloric restriction. But I have always loved food - and still do - and always felt that food controlled me rather than vice versa.\n\nWhat makes keto magic for me is that FAT MAKES YOU FULL. Even when I was morbidly obese and eating whatever (I thought) I wanted, I never knew the feeling of being genuinely full (from satiation rather than from mere overeating). With keto, I feel full all the time. I understand the heretofore inexplicable concept of leaving food on my plate. I stock the fridge with good food and, like any other good Jew, my first thought upon waking is what I'm having for lunch and dinner; now the only problem is that after a little food, I'm stuffed and don't get to bring out all the other items I would have before.\n\nJust being honest:\n\n\\-- I did some IF and 1-/2-day fasts, especially earlier on, but haven't been religious about either, especially lately. They're great and it's always helpful to keep them in the back of my mind, but the weight pours off with or without them.\n\n\\-- I have done at least a half hour of cardio all but one or two days. But - and I can stay on my elliptical for hours upon hours - I also set a maximum time per day and never exceed it. I can't go back down that rabbit hole. I also work out with a trainer one hour twice a week, focusing on weights one day and interval training the other. I don't have a lot of loose skin, but toning up and developing muscle mass are my major remaining goals. You lose the weight in the kitchen, not the gym.\n\n\\-- I haven't weighed myself this whole time, except at the doctor's. For me, that's another rabbit hole.\n\n\\-- I no longer keep diet sodas in the house (other than Zevia), but I'll have them sometimes at movies, concerts or ballgames.\n\n\\-- I start my day with 24 ounces of room temperature water, including six ounces with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar stirred in before anything else. This isn't part of keto, but it has a lot of health benefits and it's now my daily routine.\n\n\\-- I have had plateaus along the way, including one that seemed to last a month. IF, an extended fast, water can help push through, but the truth is you don't really have to change anything up if you don't want to.\n\n\\-- This board was inspirational, especially early on. What blew my mind were not just the progress pix but the short timeframes.\n\n\\-- Without keto, I would surely have been fat forever. Now, I feel like I have solved food.\n\nNow I'm going to tell you four products that have truly prevented any feeling of deprivation:\n\n1.) SPARKLING ICE (and/or CASCADE ICE) flavored waters. Hey, if Perrier/Pellegrino or Bubly/Lacroix do the trick for you, more power to you. But they're not nearly sweet enough for me. Almost every flavor of Sparkling Ice is sweet and delicious, and my doctor has given them the all-clear health-wise.\n\n2.) CELLO WHISPS. When you have that craving for something crispy or crunchy, these do the trick. Cheddar, parmesan and asiago pepperjack (which has a little kick) are each 2 net carbs for a nice-sized bag that lasts through a movie. Their new flavors - tomato/basil (4 net carbs/bag) and BBQ bacon (5 net carbs/bag) - are even yummier. When someone asks, \"What are you going to do now that you've reached your goal?\" the answer is not that I'm going back to sugar and starch. I can never go back to the S.A.D. The answer may simply be that I'll let myself have the 5 net carb bag instead of the 2 net carb bag sometimes. Little things like that.\n\n3.) HALO TOP and ENLIGHTENED ice cream. Really yummy. I wouldn't recommend introducing most flavors until you're well onto your keto journey, because they vary from three up to eight or even ten net carbs per serving. (And I wouldn't introduce them at all if you're the type who eats a pint in one sitting; you have to be able to make it last three or four.) But giving up ice cream is a major obstacle for a lot of potential keto'ers, and if you find a three-carb flavor you love (Enlightened chocolate peanut butter is damn good), you can easily make it work.\n\n4.) LILY's CHOCOLATE. OMG. Fifteen squares of delicious premium chocolate for three or four net carbs. It doesn't seem fair. Don't tell anyone, but I've allowed myself half a bar of Lily's almost every day for the last three months/50 pounds.\n\nOne other recommendation: have the 23 & Me test done. Not just the ancestry part but the complete genetic report. Take it to a great nutritionist, who can read it and tell you what you need to add to and remove from your diet, what supplements you should be using, what tests you need to have your doctor run.\n\nOK, now for the numbers:\n\n350 pounds (Nov 1) - 199 pounds (July 20)\n\nShirts down from 5XL to XL.\n\nShorts and sweats down from 2XL to L.\n\nPants and belts down from an uncomfortable 52, tight on the first loop, to 38, comfortable on the fourth loop. The right pair of 36's works too.\n\nTriglycerides down from 120 to 70.\n\nA1C down from almost pre-diabetic (5.62) to the low end of normal (4.77).\n\nCholesterol went down 50 points from November to April, then back up by July. He's not worried. \"In two months, come take a stress test. A week later, we'll consult and get it treated.\"\n\nBlood pressure was never that bad even at my heaviest but was 95/56 and 100/60 this time. \"Ideal.\"\n\nThank you to all the friendly, supportive and honest people on this board. KCKO!",

    "body": "Definitely not a traditional recipe, I'm not super experienced with cooking ramen other than a few months working in a kitchen and now I make it at home sometimes ever since, so i just kinda improvised. I suppose this would be a sort of shoyu broth, it's chicken bone/veggie broth with ginger, garlic, hot peppers and carrots, onions etc simmered in it all day.\n\nI had to make two attempts at the eggs because I'm visiting somewhere about 5k ft higher altitude than where I live so that changed my cooking time and the first batch was a bit too hard. They marinated in soy sauce with some ginger for like 8hrs \n\nI cooked the chicken thighs in a slow cooker with lemon, lime and orange juice, honey, garlic, ginger, hot peppers, onions, and a little mustard and apple cider vinegar. The vinegar and lemon balanced out the honey and orange so it wasn't overly sweet like I feared it might be\n\nPut some bok choi in the broth after straining and some negi on top. I would've added some enoki mushrooms probably but my gf doesn't like mushrooms so I went with sliced avocado. Feel free to critique or offer suggestions, I'd love to hear it!",

Even when I was 7 or 8 I remember lying awake at night cause of my heartburn. \n\nAnyway, my wife and I ordered a pizza last night, and it was great. Did the whole nine yards. Large pizza, wings, pop, and a movie on Netflix. Perfect night! But let's just say I overindulged myself, and ate waaaay too much. I felt full, but it was no big deal. That is, until I went to bed. I lay down and immediately start to feel the old familiar burning in my chest. This shit is bad! \n\nMy standard, go-to remedy when I get heartburn is to mix baking soda with warm water and downing it. Works like a charm every time. But the other day I remember my mom saying something about apple cider vinegar actually being a better alternative, because it's better for you or something. I figure, fuck it I'll give it a try. So I dilute it in water and swig it back. I go to lay down, and holy tapdancing lord it's even worse!!!! I leap out of bed and fling obscenities at my mother, who's 30 miles away. I storm into the kitchen in a blind rage and make a BIG glass of old faithful. My baking soda and warm water. I was in so much pain I didn't even think about what I was doing as I chug the whole thing.\n\nI burp a few times, which is normal, so I go to get back into bed. As soon as I lay down, I feel an unholy chemical reaction taking place in my stomach. I have a faint flashback to making a coke bottle volcano with vinegar and baking soda, right before it happens. I vomit all over the fucking place! To call it projectile vomiting wouldn't do it justice. I rail-gun vomited EVERYWHERE! A partly digested half large pizza and about 6 or 7 wings is chucked at my loving wife and loyal dog, as well as all my possessions. The dog is pelted awake by the unleashing of my cursed sickness. My wife is peppered with splash damage. My bed is covered in sludge. I am almost certain it would have hit the ceiling if I had been on my back.\n\nMy dear dear wife, with the contents of my stomach in her hair, says \"we're going to clean this up. And in the morning, if you don't make an appointment to see a doctor for this, I'm getting a divorce.\"\n\nTL;DR drank vinegar and baking soda without thinking, exploded all up in tha joint.",

I think the name brand is Prilosec. The OTC stuff is not cheap, but will give you some relief until you see your doctor. If you have insurance, you will probably pay only 5 - 10 dollars for a month's supply. Good luck, and I hope your solution is as easy as mine was.",

But we're not *just* 'cooking meat' we're ***smoking*** to make an otherwise undesirable cut of meat taste excellent, or an excellent cut of meat taste incredible.\n\nThe reason meat is tough is (generally) connective tissue. What we're trying to do is make that connective tissue go away. To accomplish this we maintain a temperature of ~200 degrees until all that connective tissue has broken down. (think of it like dissolving sugar in hot water... but the sugar is meat toughness.) It doesn't just magically happen at the given temperature, it might have to sit at that heat for a loong time or may break down earlier. \n\nSo checking the thermometer tells you you're in the neighborhood, but if you jiggle it and it acts like a solid brick of meat you're seeing the connective tissue holding the muscle tightly together still. If it wiggles and jiggles the connective tissue has released its tight hold on the muscle fibers (on a cellular level) so they can move more independently, letting the chunk of meat appear more like jello (as the above commenter said - maybe not *quite* jello). \n\nThe probe test is doing the same thing. Wiggling your meat (⁠ ͡⁠°⁠ ͜⁠ʖ⁠ ͡⁠°⁠) shows if your meat fibers can move freely. Sticking it with a probe shows if the muscle fibers part easily or if the connective tissue is still present holding the fibers together creating resistance to the probe as it pushes between the muscle fibers.",

Let it rest for 10 minutes, then knead it lightly—you’ll see the dough’s texture become smooth.\n\nPrepare the ricotta: in a saucepan, heat the soy milk. When it’s close to boiling, remove it from the heat. Immediately pour in the apple cider vinegar to curdle the milk. Stir just a little, then let it sit for 5 minutes. Place a strainer lined with cheesecloth over a mixing bowl. Pour the milk into it. The curds will stay on top while the whey drains away.\n\nWhile the ricotta is draining, roll out the ravioli dough very thinly, either with a rolling pin or a pasta machine. It should be almost translucent (about 2 mm thick). To make it easier, I cut the dough into strips about 12 cm wide.\n\nSeason the ricotta with lemon zest, chopped basil and oregano, salt, and pepper.\nPipe small mounds of filling onto the dough (about a dozen per person). Fold the pasta over to enclose the filling, then cut out all the ravioli.\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the ravioli into the water. Meanwhile, heat a pan with the margarine. After 3 minutes of cooking, when the ravioli float to the surface, they’re done!\nIn the hot pan with the margarine, pour in the lemon juice. Add the cooked ravioli along with a bit of the cooking water. Sauté everything for 2 minutes, then serve, drizzling the lemon “butter” sauce on top!\n",

Here are two of my favorite copycat recipes, please post your own!\n\n[**Copycat White Castle Burgers**](http://www.justapinch.com/recipes/main-course/beef/copycat-white-castle-burgers.html)\n\n* 1 and 1/2 lb. ground beef or chuck\n\n* 1 pkg Lipton Onion Soup Mix\n\n* 1 Tbsp peanut butter (yes, peanut butter. Trust me on this.)\n\n* 1/2 Cup of milk\n\n* 1 onion finely chopped (I used a white onion, but whatever you like)\n\n* Sara Lee Classic Dinner Rolls (or slider buns if you can find them!)\n\n* Sliced cheese and pickles if desired\n\n*My instructions vary from the website a little, just from my personal experience*\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F. Mix ground beef, onion soup mix, peanut butter and milk in a large bowl. Pour mixture onto a rimmed baking sheet. Use a rolling pin or the back of a spatula to smooth it out and make it even. Bake for 10 minutes. The meat will shrink, don't worry it's supposed to. Now add your onions around the meat and return to the oven for about 15 minutes. Take the baking sheet out, spoon onions over meat, add cheese (if desired), and return to oven for for 7 to 10 minutes, until cheese is melted. Slice burgers with a pizza cutter and serve on buns.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n[**Copycat Chipotle Barbacoa**](http://www.food.com/recipe/chipotles-barbacoa-copycat-recipe-472445)\n\n* 1/3 Cup apple cider vinegar\n\n* 4 tsp minced garlic\n\n* 4 tsp cumin\n\n* 2 tsp oregano\n\n* 1 tsp ground black pepper\n\n* 1 tsp salt\n\n* 1/2 tsp ground cloves\n\n* 2 Tbsp vegetable oil\n\n* 3/4 Cup chicken broth\n\n* 3 bay leaves\n\n* 3 Tbsp lime juice\n\n* 3 or 4 chipotle chiles in adobo\n\n* 4 to 5 lb. chuck roast\n\nTo make the adobo sauce combine vinegar, limejuice, chipotles, garlic, cumin, oregano, black pepper, salt and cloves in a blender or processor on high speed until smooth.\n\n\nRemove most of the fat from the roast and then cut into large chunks (approximately 6). Pour oil into a frying pan and sear all sides of roast on medium-high heat until browned.\n\nPlace meat into Crockpot and pour adobo sauce over meat. Pour in the chicken broth and add bay leaves. Cook on high heat 6 hours or on low all day. \n\nWhile still in the Crockpot, shred the meat with two forks and turn the heat to warm. Serve as tacos, burritos, or however you like it!",

Use ice cold water for the mix, RL actually keeps the biscuit water on ice. Also, the scoop is pretty much necessary for perfect desired shape, get the kind that has the little release trigger (not sure what it's called). \n\nI was known to make some \"special biscuits\" with bacon in my day.

I typically use a slice of cheddar instead of american. It's a nice burger.  You can see how to assemble it from the video.

    "body": "Sounds kinda stupid, but it's caused some drama, and I figure an objective perspective wouldn't be bad.\n\nI (25M) went to my aunt's (60F) house for her birthday. It was a very small thing, just me, my siblings, and her friend, who we'll call C (60F). C made a homemade vegan chocolate cake. Cool.\n\nI have ASD and SPD, which means my senses are really screwy. This cake had a lot of apple cider vinegar - like, a *lot*. My brother and sister are it just fine, so I'm not sure if my slice just had a lot, or if one of my conditions was making it taste more extreme, but it was very sour. So I ate the ice cream instead.\n\nMy aunt noticed I wasn't eating it and said something along the lines of, \"Don't like the cake, eh?\" I chuckled and nodded, I didn't want to be rude, and my aunt was aware it wasn't personal; it was just my senses being on overdrive.\n\nC got pretty quiet then, and left shortly after. The rest of us stayed and played a few games, and we left around sevenish. The next morning, I get a text from C saying it was a dick move to confirm I didn't like her cake. I told her it was nothing personal, I have sensory issues that mean some foods and flavors overwhelm me. She sent this in reply: 🙄\n\nA few days later, I was over at my aunt's house mowing her grass for her since she hurt her back. C came over and brought three drinks - one for aunt, herself, and me. She knew I was over. She purposefully bought that drink. I took a break and joined them, going to grab my drink. \n\nShe tells me, \"Oh wait, you can't drink this, you're too *sensitive*.\" I tried to tell her that drink was something I knew wouldn't bother me (it's lemonade from a vegan place nearby). She threw it out.\n\nI've been getting flak from her and her friend's about making excuses and being an asshole, and I wanted to see what a third party thought.",

Got him to put a pinch worth in his mouth to try (literally pinched a tiny piece of the piece on his plate) and he ended up spitting it out saying he didn’t like it.

And if you’re hungry, eat more cake” (their grandfather didn’t see a problem with that, so I’m expecting the same menu suggestion for his birthday). Ended up buying a whole lot of the stuff on the “picky” twins safe list (the other child will try anything someone else is eating) and having “picking platters”. Birthday party went off perfectly because he wasn’t stressing about food and nobody was getting upset that he wasn’t eating a full sit down meal that someone had slaved over for hours on end (I was the one who cooked everything except the steaks my dad wanted)\n\nEdited to add: the very next night I ended up gagging and having to spit out food I was trying due to texture...

    "body": "This is really long, but I'm putting this out there for anyone whom it may help. I had a SEVERE case of dyshidrotic eczema for two years. It wasn't just an occasional flare-up, it was a chronic, near-debilitating condition. My skin is finally clear, and I want to share what worked for me - and it's been accomplished without heavy doses of strong meds or creams or anything like that. \n\n\n**Background**\n\nAbout two and a half years ago, my dog and I went for a hike on a little-used trail in some Florida scrub. It had rained heavily that week and after dodging huge swaths of mud almost continuously for two miles, I decided to take a short-cut on another little-used trail to get back to my car. We got about a half-mile into the trail before I came to a section that was almost completely washed out. I was hot and tired, and decided to do something stupid - I decided to soldier right on through it. My shoes and socks were soaked through with mud, my dog was muddy, but we got through it. I thought nothing of it for about a week. \n\nFirst I got extremely itchy spots on the top of both of my feet. I would scratch without thinking, and within two weeks, the spots had spread until they were weeping and raw all of the time. The wounds were probably two inches by two inches on the top of each foot. I couldn't even wear shoes without tears coming to my eyes when I had to walk any distance. It was so ugly and awful that I wore closed-toed shoes all of the time, despite the fact that it rubbed against my skin. I just couldn't take the looks people would give me when they caught sight of my feet. I'm not crazy about doctors, but none of the over-the-counter remedies had given me any relief whatsoever, so I went to a dermatologist at the recommendation of a friend. He gave me some steroid creams, the wounds healed up, and again I thought no more about it. \n\nA couple of weeks after that, I started to get small, fluid-filled blisters on my hands and the sides of my feet. I work a lot in seawater and thought maybe I was having a reaction to something in the water, so I tried to limit the time when my hands and feet were wet with saltwater. However, it got no better, and by the end of the month, the blisters were numerous, large, itchy and painful. Every morning I examined my hands and feet and was dismayed that there always seemed to be new blisters. When the blisters would crack and ooze, the skin underneath was extremely tender and raw. I got used to wearing bandages on my hands and feet at all times. \n\nI work with the public at an environmental education center, and obvsiouly having continuously bandaged hands wasn't a good look. So, I reluctantly booked an appointment with a new dermatologist and embarked on a two year journey of total fucking misery with my skin. \n\n\n**Original Treatments**\n\nIf my dermatologist immediately knew it was dyshidrotic eczema, he didn't tell me right away. He examined my hands and my feet, put me on some antibiotics, and sent me on my way. That didn't help. I went back a couple of weeks later and was prescribed some steroid creams and was told to do diluted bleach baths for my hands and feet 3x a week. For a while, this seemed to quell the worst of it. \n\nThen it was like my skin just exploded. I would get such large blisters on the soles of my feet (it was no longer just contained to the side of my feet) that I was barely able to walk, and would have to go to walk-in clinics and have them drained. When they would test the fluid that came out of the blisters, nothing unusual was found. For a while, they even thought I had MRSA and put me on the strongest antibiotics on the market - it did absolutely nothing. The blisters on my hands were so large and painful that even things like typing on a keyboard was misery. \n\nOver the course of the next two years, my dermatologist and I threw everything we could think of at my dyshidrotic eczema. Name any steroid cream, I've been on it. Name any type of anti-fungal medicine - oral and topical - and I've been on it, both prescription and over-the-counter. I did the bleach baths. I even tried apple cider vinegar baths and also mixed it in with everything I was drinking, having heard that that helps some people. I did yogurt baths, and ate the plain organic yogurt that tastes like shit. I would slather steroid ointment on my hands and feet and night, and wear cotton gloves and socks to keep the ointment in place. I tried several types of essential oils, like tea tree oil and several others, to no avail. Absolutely nothing helped. I was in total misery. \n\nAbout nine months ago, my dermatologist reluctantly put me on a strong course of Prednisone. He hadn't wanted to do it, since he (rightly) said that it was a treatment, not a cure, and that I couldn't be on a heavy dose for too long. I started taking 60mg of Prednisone a day. For good measure, he also started me on mycophenolate, which is an immuno-suppressant normally given to transplant patients before their transplant surgeries. I was on 2g (yes, grams) a day; any time I called the special pharmacy to have that delivered, I was always asked what transplant I was getting. If I could have had a skin transplant, believe me brothers and sisters, I would have done it. During this time, I was still on steroid creams and ointments daily. The meds made me absolutely wired. I don't think I slept for close to a month due to the Prednisone and the stomach cramps from the mycophenolate were miserable. \n\nThe blisters went away, and I felt like a brand new human for a while. Anyone who has suffered with severe dyshidrotic eczema knows what a toll it takes on your self-esteem and your self-image. I went on dates for the first time since this started. Hell, there were even days here or there when I didn't have to wear a bandage, or I was only wearing one or two. I could walk around in flip-flops and I wasn't ashamed. \n\nI started to taper the prednisone, and once I got down to 30mg a day and 2g of mycophenolate, the blisters roared back to life as though they'd never skipped a beat. My dermatologist had hoped that by giving my skin several months to heal, that once I started to taper the Prednisone, that my skin would be able to combat whatever it was that was causing the dyshidrotic eczema. It didn't. It had only stalled it temporarily. \n\nI'm always going to remember sitting in the dermatologist's office four months ago and the defeated look on my derm's face when I showed him my fucked up hands and feet. I was on 30mg of Prednisone and 2g of mycophenolate a day. I was doing steroid creams 2x a day and the ointment at night with gloves and socks. I was doing bleach baths, apple cider vinegar baths and drinks every day, and using essential oils every day. No one was more dedicated to my recovery than me - I wanted my fucking life back. He reluctantly told me that he had done all he could do, that I would probably be on immuno-suppressants and rounds of Prednisone for the rest of my life, and that he was referring me to the Mayo Clinic, that maybe they could help. I was absolutely crushed, Reddit. Crushed. \n\nBut I also knew that there had to be a way out of this. People must have suffered from dyshidrotic eczema in the days before heavy meds and steroid creams. There had to be a way out of this. That's where you come in, Reddit. \n\n\n**A New Perspective**\n\nAbout three months ago, I stumbled on this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/384iiz/dyshidrotic_eczema_healing_successful/\n\nI talked with /u/benf101 about what had worked for him/her, and followed the links s/he gave me. I devoured the links, scraping up every bit of info I could. I had not seriously considered that this form of eczema, or at least my particular case, could be an internal problem rather than a purely external one. I had thought that it might be (hence drinking diluted ACV and plain organic yogurt), but nothing I could find online supported that and my dermatologist was a little leery of that theory, plus, nothing I had done in that regard had done shit for me. I did a LOT of thinking about it, and thought that maybe this was a gut problem, and that my gut was pushing the toxins out through my skin. I had never targeted the problem directly, hence, I was chronically dealing with the most visable outcome of that problem. \n\nThere is evidence that dyshidrotic eczema may be a food allergy and/or indicative of an extreme candida overgrowth in the gut. It's possible that some candida overgrowth can be triggered by fungus picked up in the environment, which is what I believe happened to me, as I'd never had this issue before. The fungus is commonly called a dermaphyte. You can't, and shouldn't, try to get rid of candida entirely, as everyone needs it in their digestive tract. However, an overgrowth in certain individuals can manifest in forms of severe eczema. Diet changes and supplements can curb or eradicate the problem in certain individuals. I just prayed that I was one of those individuals. \n\n\n**What Finally Worked**\n\nDiet Changes: For three months thus far, I have completely cut out wheat, refined sugars, alcohol and switched to a low-carb, whole food diet (with the majority of my carbs coming from root veggies). This is hard as shit for someone like me, but stuff like refined sugars, carbs (which turn into sugars) and alcohol can feed the candida overgrowth. Wheat, in some individuals, can also contribute to the problem. I have recently started to re-introduce alcohol (because life ain't worth living without beer every now and then) to no ill effect thus far. You must do the diet for at least 3 months before starting to slowly add foods back into your diet (unless you're a dummy like me who needs a beer sometimes), to see if one of them triggers a breakout. \n\nSupplements: I started taking strong probiotics twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening). I also started using oil of oregano. Twice a day, I dilute 6-7 drops of oil of oregano in a glass of water (oil of oregano burns like hell, you MUST dilute it) and drink it, and then dilute 4-5 drops in olive oil and apply it to my hands and feet. \n\nDie-Off Symptoms: I did have candida die-off symptoms, though they were not as bad as I'd prepared myself for. I had a few rashes, a few bouts with the porcelain goddess, and a few days when I felt fuzzy and tired, but that all quickly passed. \n\nAbout two weeks after starting this regiment, my blisters started disappearing. I dropped down to 20mg of Predinose, and then quickly down to 10mg of Prednisone a day (that withdrawal was NOT fun). I also dropped down to 1g of mycophenolate a day, since I couldn't take the damn stomach cramps anymore. \n\nAfter a month, I woke up to my first day with NO new blisters in two years. I dropped down to 5mg of Prednisone at the behest of my dermatologist. I switched to taking mycophenolate every other day instead of every day. Each time I dropped the dosage of one of my meds, I would have a small outbreak of blisters on my hands, but nothing close to what it had been. The blisters were smaller and healed much faster than they had been. \n\nAfter two months, I had dropped the mycophenolate completely and was down to 5mg of Prednisone every other day, which is where I still am. A new blister popped up every now and then, but would begin to heal within 2 days. None of them burst. None of them required a bandage. None of them got very big. \n\nThis morning, I went to my standing dermatologist appointment. He examined my hands, and was very surprised. He wanted to know all about the diet and supplements, and wrote it all down, as he said he may be able to suggest it to others who have been long-suffering with this as I had. The nurse even took pictures of my hands and feet to show how much better the condition is now. For the first time in two years, I walked out of the dermatologist's office without making a new appointment before I left. I'm now on a \"as-needed\" basis, like a normal fucking human being. \n\nIt's been close to three months and I feel like a new person. I feel like I am finally going to beat this. I am still doing the 5mg of Prednisone every other day, and when my bottle runs out in two weeks, I will be off of it completely. Otherwise, it's just the diet change and the supplements. That's it. \n\nOur bodies have a blueprint to heal themselves of many conditions we normally treat with strong medicine. I now firmly believe that this is one of them. I'm not saying that what I did will work for everyone, but if you have as bad a case as I did, try it. You have nothing to lose. If nothing else, you'll eat healthy for a few months and get your gut back in good working order. And it may just save your self-esteem (and your skin!) like it did for me. \n\n",

I managed to get it under control (after a lot of suffering) and it seemed I was completely free of it. Until November 2013 when the little blisters began to appear on my right hand again after 15 years. \n\n(I uploaded a gallery of images here: http://imgur.com/a/A3Ct8. The photos are in reverse order - start at the bottom to see how it progressed). \n\nI have very bad reactions to the steroid creams so my doctors prescribed prednisone (on-and-off for 18 months), and an immunosuppressant (Cyclosporine) for four months.\n\nThe immunosuppressant made me nauseous for the first two months straight - I lost weight because I had no appetite - and the prednisone raised my blood pressure, which made me feel even sicker. Awful drugs.\n\nI also found a change in diet is absolutely the way to go! Now I get very minor flare-ups and only occasionally. I know the eczema is triggered when I eat shit (chocolate and other sugary foods, or any heavily processed foods, really). I've been off soft drinks (fizzy drinks) since December 2013. \n\nIt really annoys me that the doctors I saw were all about pumping me with pills, as a medium/long term solution. Never once did they discuss my diet with me or provide me with a more holistic approach.\n\nSo yeah, I'm really, really happy for you :)",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI posted here a while back about how I built and sold my trend-spotting tool, Exploding Topics, in 6 months. Since it was an acqui-hire, I’ve still been working on the tool and improving how it works.\n\n(Partly thanks to the great feedback you guys gave me!)\n\nAnd I spent all last week using it to figure out what the long-term impacts of COVID-19 might be.\n\nSpecifically what new business opportunities have been accelerated by the virus… and are outlasting the lockdowns.\n\nThere are some pretty surprising ones.\n\nI made an awesome interactive version with charts and definitions of each trend that you can [check out here](https://explodingtopics.com/post-covid-trends).\n\nOr if you don't mind plain text, here's the list:\n\n**Drop servicing** \\- interest is up 4,900%\n\nwhy the growth:\n\nPeople on furlough or out of work are turning to new approaches to making money.\n\n**Gaming Glasses** \\- interest is up 210%\n\nwhy the growth:\n\nAs gaming usage spiked during the crisis, millions suffered from dry eyes, dizziness and other symptoms of long gaming sessions.

And as things start to open up, people want to a convenient way to enjoy wine at parks, concerts and other outdoor events.\n\n**Swiss Cheese Plant** \\- interest is up 1,466%\n\nwhy the growth:\n\nDemand for plants of all kinds shot up during lockdowns (people were spending more time at home and wanted to spruce things up). And certain plants, like swiss cheese plant, grew in popularity thanks to popular posts on IG and TikTok.\n\n**Robotic Lawn Mower** \\- interest is up 492%\n\nwhy the growth:\n\nThis trend isn't directly related to Covid. Demand for robotic lawnmowers have spiked because the tech has significantly improved over the last 18 months.\n\n**Yakiniku** \\- interest is up 19%\n\nwhy the growth:\n\nThe crisis led to a spike in exotic foods that could be shared on IG and TikTok.\n\n**Dermaplaning** \\- interest is up 1,440%\n\nwhy the growth:\n\nShutdowns caused spas around the world to close.

For the millions that work at home, finding the right home office setup became a thing for the first time. Which led to a rise in ergonomic equipment.\n\n**Toppr** \\- interest is up 426%\n\nwhy the growth:\n\nIn the early days of the crisis, online learning was a chaotic mess of hastily stitched together Zoom calls.

    "body": "I do a lot of things that I consider clever and frugal around food to avoid waste, keep my food costs low and variety high. I'm putting a list below; I'd love to hear yours!\n\n1. When things are on sale or when I have a lot in the garden, I buy a little extra and ferment some pickles. You can ferment/pickle any fruit or vegetable (through fruit takes a bit more sensitivity to get right) with just salt and water. Ferments are really good for you and cheap to make. You don't need fancy airlocks or fido jars, they can be made in any glass jar. A cheap airlock is a disposable, foodsafe glove on the mouth of the jar with a couple holes poked in the fingertips for air flow. Fermented krauts, salsas, chutneys, pickles and relishes will keep for months after the produce would otherwise have spoiled and they brighten up any food they're paired with. Fruit vinegars are also so easy to make. Apple scrap vinegar with your apple cores makes very nearly the same product as apple cider vinegar while using up something that would otherwise be composted.\n\n2. Use the pickle juice! Pickle juice makes a great base for soups, can be used to cook vegetables or in place of water in any recipe where you want a little more oompf and acid. \n\n3. Growing things. Even if you are in a tiny appartment, growing spouts in a jar on a windowsill is a great, cheap, really easy source of vegetables to keep things interesting. It's a great thing for kids to learn to do as well and empowers them to know they can grow food wherever they are. You just need a mason jar with a ring and some cheesecloth and beans from the store. \n\n4. Save bacon fat (or other meat fat) and use it to cook with. Animal fat is an excellent cooking fat and can even be used in place of butter in baking (bacon fat ginger snaps are so good). Butter is expensive (so is meat but if you're already eating it, may as well use all of it).\n\n5. Buy cheap cuts of meat and slow cook them. Always save the fat and broth and use in other dishes. One of the best ways to be a sustainable meat eater is to learn how to use the parts that other people don't want. Tails, feet, heads, etc. There are beautiful traditional recipes for these items all over the world that make delicious food for very little cost.\n\n6. Use dried beans and flavour them - if you're tired of eating beans all the time, one of the best things you can do to make them delicious and new is to rehydrate your own. This is also much much cheaper and adding a little flavour when you're cooking them from dried goes miles towards making them special. I use leftover broth and stocks to make mine and always throw in a bay leaf and some dried onions.\n\n7. Invest in a slow cooker or a pressure cooker. Both of these can be found for very little money in thrift stores. I've bought pressure cookers multiple times for $5. I think this is one of the best investments for frugal and delicious eating. Pressure cookers take all the time out of making beans from dried, making tough cuts of meat tender and making soups in just a few minutes. People are afraid to use them but they're simple and easy and if you learn them, you can benefit by taking them off peoples' hands after they're given as wedding presents to folks who will never put them into service.\n\n8. If you have a little outdoor space or garden space, learn to forage. In many places, there are edible native or naturalized plants growing all over in prolific amounts. Learn them and how to use them - I used to walk home from downtown every day and pick full salads worth of miner's lettuce, nettles, dandilions and sheep sorrel from suburban boulevards. Better if you can grow your own little patches if you're concerned about contamination, of course, but all the same, free is free. \n\n9. Make your own yoghurt. It's significantly cheaper than buying it. You can buy a four litre jug of milk that makes four litres of yoghurt for a LOT less money than buying it as pre-made yoghurt. All you need is saucepan, a mason jar, a warm place, and a bit of yoghurt from either a store bought batch or the last homemade batch to use as starter.  You can also make a very cheap facsimile of ricotta with whole milk and a bit of acid (whey, lemon juice or vinegar). \n\n10. From homemade yoghurt you can also make labneh (soft, tart cheese) by straining the yoghurt overnight. Mix the labneh with salt and herbs and garlic for a fancy spread or topping for soup. They whey leftover from ricotta or labneh can be used as a base for stocks, soups or to cook vegetables in (my favourite is turnips boiled in whey and then roasted in the oven with a bit of salt).\n\nWhat are your top ten?",

I use a citrus vinegar and water mixture to clean glass and the concentrate is a fantastic fabric softener. \n\n2. You can also use peels to make Oleo Saccharum. Pith-free peels plus sugar draws the oil from the peel and makes a lovely and mild syrup for teas, cocktails, or recipes that call for simple syrup. \n\n3. Shrubs! If fruit is going bad, letting equal parts sugar and syrup sit for 48 hours and then adding vinegar and straining out solids makes a fantastic drink flavoring concentrate. \n\n4. Juice from canned corn makes a fantastic ramen add-in.\n\n5. When I meal prep a bunch of veggies, I save the leftover bits (butts, certain peels, stems, scraps essentially) and blend them with some lemon juice before freezing into cubes. I use these “green cubes” instead of ice cubes in my smoothies for an extra pow of nutrients. \n\n6. I freeze sour cream into cubes as well! I don’t use a lot of sour cream but some recipes call for it. When it is on sale, I measure it into cubes, freeze, and then bag. When I need sour cream, I can use as many cubes as I need. \n\n7.

        "body": "Just a small typo- they meant equal parts sugar and fruit or fruit and syrup. If you've ever made strawberry topping for shortcake then you are familiar with the first step of making a shrub. I absolutely love shrubs, and learned to make them because I'm always buying too much fruit and didn't want to waste anything. But the vinegar can throw people off- I always say if you like kombucha you will love shrubs. My tips for making your first shrub:\n\n1) Keep it simple and consider the juiciness/density of the fruit when mixing with sugar- strawberries basically want to be syrup so you don't need as much sugar as you do for apples, which are denser. Equal parts is a good guide, but it's not a hard rule.\n\n2) Too much sugar and you won't get a strong fruit taste. I've done strawberries in 24 hours, apples can take up to 4 days. You can add more sugar but you can't take it away, so keep stirring and give it time before you think about adding sugar.\n\n3) After you strain the solids add your vinegar a little at a time and taste often. You can drown out subtle flavors quickly by adding too much vinegar. I've found that apple cider or champagne vinegar works best, but if you've got an asian mart nearby they may have fruit based vinegars that are often more subtle so a good choice for shrubs. I love to use Datu Pitu which is a pear vinegar.\n\nThat's it! I add a shot of shrub to sparkling/seltzer/soda waters, bubbly wines like cava, dry ciders- go nuts! Get creative and combine a fruit with an herb (apple/fennel, strawberry/basil) or combine two fruits, an herb, a root, whatever. I've used an orange ginger shrub in a marinade for pork, and poured a plum lavender shrub over ice cream. Thanks for letting me ramble about shrubs- have fun!",

Reheating a meal later uses less energy when you aren’t using cookware, washing extra etc. Energy savings. \n\nI buy meat and other expensive items when they are marked down. A store I go to sells perishable foods for 30% off the day before the best before date. I combine this whenever I can with other discounts and usually end up with 40% off my groceries. \n\nWe have a few layers that mostly free range. Can you say non-stop eggs? Plus chickens with chase down and eat bugs in the yard. \n\nSpeaking of eggs, egg pasta is dead easy to make. And way nicer that store bought, and way cheaper. \n\nWe gather foods as well. It’s berry time and I’ll find wild berry patches and pick a lot of them. Home made jam is the result. \n\nWe have a garden and grow veggies, fruit and nut trees, grapes and strawberries.

    "body": "I was having trouble with my hair for years. I’d do the whole shebang: oil treatment for a few hours before washing my hair, hair wash, let the conditioner soak in the shower, put leave in on afterwards. Still my hair would never turn out like it used to. When I was younger, my hair was effortlessly soft, shiny, wavy and not frizzy. As I got older, this went away. I couldn’t figure out why.\n\nAnyway, I finally realised a while back that I had switched to all ‘natural’ hair products years ago. Silicone free, sulphate free, paraben free, so on and so forth. Honestly, I don’t know why I did it. I wasn’t really thinking about it too much. I guess the clean beauty industry got me on this occasion…\n\nI realised a while back that the issue was likely these ‘natural’ products I was using on my hair. Recently I finally got around to researching and buying a bunch of silicone-heavy products and swapping out all of my routine. I also swapped to a clarifying shampoo. Oh, another thing I wanted to do was make my routine cheaper! I became a full time student recently and can’t afford expensive products or hair cuts anymore.\n\nMy routine product swaps:\n\nA’Kin Mild & Gentle Fragrance Free Shampoo 500mL ($25 AUD) > Aveeno Apple Cider Vinegar Clarifying Shampoo 354mL ($19.50 AUD but I only ever buy it on sale for $9.75 AUD)\n\nA’Kin Mild & Gentle Fragrance Free Conditioner 500mL ($25 AUD) > Sunsilk Soft & Smooth Conditioner 700mL ($12 AUD but I only ever buy it on sale for $6 AUD)\n\nA’Kin Moisture Rich Lavender & Anthyllis Leave-In Conditioner 150mL ($18 AUD) > L'Oreal Elvive Dream Lengths No Haircut Cream Leave In Treatment 200mL ($14 AUD but I only ever buy it on sale for $7 AUD)\n\nMoroccanoil Original Oil Treatment ($75 AUD) > Qanzire Moroccan Hair Oil ($5 AUD) note this is just a knockoff of the real stuff, it works almost as well and for one fifteenth of the cost!\n\nI’ve also started cutting my own hair. The last proper haircut I got was about 9 months ago ($100 AUD > $0 AUD). Since then I’ve given myself a few DIY trims. I’m not very good at it yet and don’t really know what I’m doing, and I’m using a bodgy cheap hair razor comb to do it. I know, I know, really bad, lol. I’m saving up to buy some proper, salon-grade hairdressing scissors!\n\nAnyway, my hair is still a work in progress. I need to figure out how to properly cut my hair and I want to learn how to use heat styling tools as currently my hair is only ever air-dried and however it dries naturally is the ‘style’ I wear it in (as pictured). But overall, I’m really happy! I’m spending a lot less and my hair looks a lot better - thanks silicones :)\n\n",

But in all that blood, shit, and filth that russians brought into Ukraine, we need to remember the beauty of our world and the rich tapestry of life that we see in art, culture, and cooking.  The rich tapestry of cuisine is shared, borrowed, and re-invented, and today we will share a story about a tasty Ukrainian dish that is a representation of how cultures from across the world influence one another.\n\nIn this case, the story starts with the establishment of a trade route with the Americas and bringing new foods that are now feeding most of the world - corn.  With great respect we must recognize the sheer scale of the tragedy this trade route brought to people in the Americas.  For the oppressed and always starving people in the Carpathians (anyone who has tried to grow crops in the mountains without modern technology knows what I am talking about) corn was a divine gift from faraway nations.  Folk in the Carpathian mountains started to cultivate corn with great reverence and soon it became a staple food.  And this is how **Banosh** was created - one of the first fusion dishes of traditional Ukrainian and world cuisines.\n\nSo what is banosh?   It is a thick cornmeal porridge cooked on sour cream (sometimes fresh cream or milk) and served with bryndza (Ukrainian sheep cheese) and shkvarky (bacon cracklings).  Sometimes it is served with caramelized onions and mushrooms.  Banosh is a part of a large continuum of ground corn-oriented foods - in the same big family as polenta in Italy, Mămăligă in Romania, grits in the USA, hasty pudding in the UK, and pastel de choclo in Latin America.\n\nBanosh - or *banush*, as the Hutsuls say - should be mixed only with a wooden spoon and it needs to be mixed only in one direction, preferably clockwise so all ingredients are evenly distributed in the porridge creating a golden goodness of flavors.  The most aromatic and enigmatic banosh is created in a cauldron on an open fire outdoors, but as most of us do not really cook like that anymore (I will leave unanswered whether it is a bad or good thing), we will provide you with a different recipe as well.  Also, what is super interesting is that, traditionally, banosh was cooked by men.  I think I like Hutsuls more and more :)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Traditional Banosh\n\n[This is a fantastic example of the consistency of a traditional banosh.  If you zoom in, you can see that butter has started to separate from the porridge.  Baba would approve.](https://preview.redd.it/bassnwhedkh91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f0214c96131cc12e6225da57e89fa43d3643ac7)\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 500 ml of cream (or sour cream - although in this case, porridge will be a bit sour which we like :) )\n* 200g of cornmeal\n* Pinch of salt\n* Cheese (preferably sheep, something like fresh feta or farmer's cheese)\n* Bacon (preferably something very fatty and thick-cut, like pancetta or pork belly)\n\n**Recipe:**\n\n1. Pour the cream into a cauldron (or a pan with thick walls), put on moderate heat, and bring to a boil.\n2. Little by little, add cornmeal, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon\n3. Reduce the heat to a low, add a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring, until the porridge is almost soft. You may need a little more cream at this stage, as the porridge should have the consistency of thick sour cream, without turning into a homogeneous \"cake\".\n4. At the same time fry the bacon cut into cubes to create cracklings.\n5. Back to the porridge - while the cauldron stays over heat, beat the porridge with a spoon so intensely that buttery oil appears on its surface (remember we did not add butter, so it is kind of cool!).  When you see the melted butter - transfer it to a shallow plate.\n6. Spread the cracklings on the banosh, and also spread the crumbed cheese on the plate as well - this needs to be done while the porridge is very hot so the cheese will melt!\n7. *Optional:* Add fresh parsley and/or a fried egg.\n8. *Smachnoho*!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Vegetarian Recipe\n\nAnd this is Yevhen Klopotenko's recipe with a more modern twist, as we all know that YouTubers always feel the need to add random stuff to the recipe - he can only hope my baba will not find him to give him a good *prochuhana* (thrashing) for altering traditional recipes!:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 100-150 g of mushrooms\n* 450 ml of milk - full fat\n* 150 g of cornmeal\n* 100 ml of apple or wine vinegar\n* 200 ml of water\n* 1 onion\n* 20 g butter\n* Sunflower oil for sautéing mushrooms\n* 1 tbsp of sour cream\n* 50 g of hard cheese (could use cheddar or blue cheese - don't tell baba)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Recipe:**\n\n1. Prepare the onion: cut it into thin half-rings and transfer it to a bowl.  Pour 100 ml of apple cider vinegar, and 200 ml of cold water into it, and add a pinch of salt.  Leave the onions to marinate for 30 minutes.\n2. Wash and cut the mushrooms into medium strips.  You can choose small mushrooms, then you don't need to cut them.\n3. Heat a pan with 20g of butter and 1 tbsp of sunflower oil.  Sauté the mushrooms for about 3-4 minutes.\n4. Prepare corn grits according to the instruction on the packaging. Add salt to taste.\n5. Add 1 tbsp of sour cream to the finished porridge. If you want to make the banosh lighter and easier to digest (as not all of us have an iron belly of Hutsuls) use low-fat sour cream. Mix the porridge with sour cream until smooth.\n6. Take a deep plate for serving.  Divide the banosh into two portions. Transfer the first portion of porridge to a plate, and add coarsely grated hard cheese.  Do not mix.\n7. Put the second portion of porridge on the cheese - this way it will melt. And on top of the cheese add mushrooms and then onions.\n8. Serve immediately - it needs to still be hot.\n\nAccording to Klopotenko, for banosh, you will need cornmeal of a medium grind.  It becomes very tender during cooking, and the grains come together to form a smoother consistency.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Very important!**  Banosh is a dish that is **served hot and does not tolerate reheating**, so do not count on leftovers.  If you do, I am sure Domovyk will be super upset with you and will create some mischief at your home for squandering a perfectly good banosh!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# CHARITY LIST\n\n[u/Jesterboyd](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jesterboyd/) is a mod in [r/ukraine](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/) and local to Kyiv.

It’s been 4 years now.\n\nNothing ever lasted for me until I found a rhythm through **intermittent fasting** and food timing. I’m sharing my experience here (N=1) in case it’s useful to anyone on a similar path.\n\nHere’s what made a real difference for me:\n\n🔹 **Fasting routine:**  \n– 18:6 most days  \n– 24-hour fast once a week (usually Monday)  \n– First meal \\~11:00 AM, last meal \\~5:30 PM  \n– No snacks, no sweeteners, no “keto treats”\n\n🔹 **What I eat:**  \n– High-protein meals (\\~1.2g protein per kg of body weight)  \n– Fatty fish, eggs, fermented veggies, garlic, bitter greens (like arugula, chicory)  \n– Homemade L. Reuteri yogurt  \n– Cooked with ghee or butter  \n– Electrolytes daily (magnesium, potassium, sodium)  \n– Apple cider vinegar before meals (1 tsp in water)\n\n🔹 **What I avoid:**  \n– Sugar, grains, seed oils  \n– Liquid calories  \n– Eating after dark  \n– Grazing or “just a bite” eating\n\nWhat changed for me:  \n– Cravings disappeared  \n– Constant hunger gone  \n– Brain fog lifted  \n– Stable mood and energy (no caffeine needed)  \n– Visible signs of fatty liver improved  \n– Most importantly — I felt like I was finally in control of my appetite and metabolism\n\nEventually, I wrote everything down to better understand what worked and why — more like a personal project.  \nThat became a small book I titled ***An Easy Way to Regain Health and Lose Weight***.  \nI’m not promoting anything here, just mentioning it in case someone’s curious about the full breakdown.\n\nHappy to share more if helpful — or answer anything if you’re stuck like I was for so many years.  \nThanks for reading, and respect to everyone here doing the real work.",

    "body": "When I wrote the title I was going to make an advice post. Just flesh out the story (without identifying detail) and ask if anybody knew ANY resources for men that could help this guy at this point. He owes his lawyer a ton of money already, “avoiding IEDs” is not an impressive resume skill in Portland, Oregon, and he’s so close to eviction I believe there’s a date for the sheriff to arrive. Everything I can find is specifically for women, so r/MensRights it is. [EDIT: It's a longshot, I know, but it can't hurt to ask. So, if anybody does have an idea, tell it!]\n\nThen when checking a date I found The Article, and now I am actually shaking with rage. \nhttp://www.katu.com/economy/49394232.html \n\nHis wife wrote this when he was first deployed. It is entirely about how he’s a lazy doofus who just stumbled accidentally into overseas service because he can’t provide organic asparagus for his family. After she QUIT HER JOB to WRITE. And she published it (sort of) on a local news page. I am trying to imagine the sexes reversed on this story and just can’t. \n\nOf course, she doesn’t say that he didn’t have a job because she wanted HIM to stay at home with the kids…at least until she got bored of working. She does not say their mortgage was absurd because SHE bought a giant house in the Trust Fund Hippie part of town with a loan she couldn’t afford. \n\nWhen he got home, the house was falling apart and so full of crap that three kids were piling up to sleep in part of one of the five bedrooms. The kids had lice that the wife refused to treat with anything but apple cider vinegar. That’s okay though, the school can’t MAKE her get rid of them because they don’t go to school anymore. They aren’t “homeschooled” either, there’s no structure of any kind. She barely stayed at the house, mostly keeping the kids with the married couple she was fucking, the wife’s boyfriend, and seven other kids. Their autistic son spent most of his home time in a closet to keep him from freaking out over the crowd. The money is ALL vanished…spent or hidden, who knows. A lot of it went to self-publishing a magazine about parenting. Really. \n\nI don’t know if he even saw that story, probably not. I know he found a draft of a blog post about how he was only a driver, so he wasn’t even in any danger over there. Because driving high-profile targets through Kuwait is exactly like driving a CEO through Connecticut. \n\nThe divorce papers she gave him a month or so after he got home mention that he “abandoned” his three sons. By fucking serving in a war zone. So of course she should get full custody. I guess she’ll probably get it.\n\nSo, this turned out all disconnected and shit but I’m posting anyway to get it out there because oh my God people should know this is a thing that happens.\n\nETA3&4: He set up a fundraising page about a year ago. Which I linked earlier (because it does still work) but am taking down (because it has a ton of pictures of his kids, so I shouldn't have posted it without permission. Also, like a commenter pointed out, I do not know if the account setup still works, it could go nowhere or be garnished or God help us go to his wife.) \n\nETA: I found her blog. The first post is her telling a story to a crowd about the couple she was shacking up with, and how she is a tragic heroine for that too. No mention of her husband, though. http://www.mixcloud.com/Tads_Story_Telling_Night/sarah-gilbert-102014/\n\nETA2: The poem: \"On my fourth visit from CPS [Child Protective Services]\" http://imgur.com/SRXH0Xr",

Somewhere around 11pm I got a call on, of all things, the sales line. I answered to hear the most despondent, defeated voice I've ever heard. It was one of our subscribers who informed me he was calling to pay his cable bill. I pulled up his account and saw that he had been disconnected months before for non-pay and had a sizable debt on his account. He apologized for the debt and wanted to pay off the entirety at once. While I was inspecting his account a little closer, he told me he had just returned from deployment in Iraq and come back to an empty house with no power, no water, no cable, no phone and a Dear John letter from his wife on the dinner table. He'd spent the day paying off the bills his soon-to-be-ex-wife had left him and we were last on the list. He asked me how soon he could get his cable turned back on. It was at this point that I noticed that the account was not in his name but in the name of his Ex. It was also at this point that The Star Spangled Banner started playing in the back of my head. I asked the customer if he knew where the Ex was currently living. He said yes and gave me the address. I linked the old account to the ex-wife, sent the entire lot to collections and signed the Soldier up as a new customer. I then proceeded to give him every freakin' discount code we had available, regardless of whether he qualified for them or not. By the time I finished, he had free cable for six months, free phone, our fastest internet package for about 10 bucks a month and an installation appointment for the next day.  I told him never to tell anyone how he got all this, but to remember that some of us were grateful for his service. He was pretty choked up by the end of the call and I will never forget my chance to do something nice for someone who truly deserved it.",

According to [this article](http://journal.scconline.org/pdf/cc1997/cc048n02/p00117-p00121.pdf) from the *Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists*:\n\n> Many studies have shown that the early sebum flow after the skin is cleaned comes mainly from a reservoir in the pilosebaceous follicle, and not from any feedback stimulation of the sebaceous gland ... most of the antidandruff shampoos showed an absence of significant SER change over time ... Such a finding confirms the unreality of the so-called reactive seborrhea, in which the sebaceous excretion increases with the frequency of most hair washes\n\nThe study shows a link between excessive oil production and anti-dandruff shampoos containing selenium sulfide, but not ordinary shampoos. \n\nShampoos are essentially a combination of [surfactants](http://web.archive.org/web/20070216104007/http://www.pg.com/science/pbi_pert.jhtml) which serve to dissolve oils as well as trap dirt particles. In addition to cleaning away dirt, the shampoo also reduces the natural oils in your hair and scalp. This *will* make the scalp drier than usual, but the scalp is constantly supplying little droplets of sebum to the surface, and the scalp will replenish itself quickly, with no harm done. The exception is if you're particularly prone to dry scalp issues (or psoriasis, seborrhea, etc.), in which case you will have to take that into consideration.\n\nIf you wash too frequently, you will be constantly removing the sebum, and logically your scalp will be chronically dry. I don't think you can scientifically say it's *harmful* unless, again, you have scalp problems. Also, some people (anecdotally, me) need some oil in the hair to keep from being too bristly. I wash my hair once a week, and add a tiny bit of oil afterwards, works pretty well.\n\nNote that if you use hair-styling products such as pomades, creams or waxes, you will eventually need to wash your hair with some kind of oil-dispersing surfactant, since they typically include small amounts of water-insoluble compounds such as petroleum jelly or paraffin wax. (As anyone who uses such products will tell you, they will build up in your hair over time, and eventually you have to start \"fresh\".)\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, the above-mentioned study suggests that your scalp will *not* compensate for dryness if you overshampoo, ie. that this is one of those myths that sound reasonable, so therefore it must be true.

        "body": ">The active ingredient in all shampoos is some type of detergent, usually sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which uses its amphipathic properties to dissolve both polar and non-polar residues in your hair. Conditioners basically contain the same thing, but contain much less SLS and much more additional oils and proteins that help your hair retain moisture and body after shampooing. The main difference between shampoos is the concentration of SLS in the product. SLS's main function is to remove the naturally excreted oils (sebum) your hair produces, and since this varies greatly from person to person, some people respond better to products with different concentrations of SLS. For example, if you use a shampoo that's for \"oily hair\" it probably contains a higher concentration of SLS to help dissolve the oils. If you were to use this product on your \"dry and frizzy hair,\" it would exacerbate the problem. Basically, this is the BASIC idea behind using different formulations of shampoo, but other compounds can be added to the product to \"promote bounciness.\" One is the protein albumin (the egg white protein), which denatures in the product and acts like a sticky glue that firms up your hair. Additionally, products can also control for hair pH, smell nice, and moisturize your scalp to reduce oil secretion or flakes.\nAll in all, it's a balance between cleaning the hair and over-cleaning the hair, which dries it out and leads to \"frizziness.\" The shampooing and conditioning cycle is summarized as: remove all natural oils without overdrying (shampoo), readd those oils in the right amount to reestablish the moisture and pH (conditioning).\n\n[Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/mpxj6/are_different_brands_and_types_of_shampoo_and/c32wkdp)\n\n>As an expert, I'm going to disagree with everyone except [thisaccountisbs](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/j51ri/chemically_what_differentiates_a_good_shampoo/c298cub). My background: I worked for one of the world's largest producers of shampoo in R&D.\n\n>Shampoos are not slightly acidic, their pH isn't that important.\n\n>The surfactant is really important in making the stuff work.\n\n>There are additives to make them smell good etc etc but mostly they are affecting your perception of how well it works. Some of the anti-frizz and moisturizing stuff isn't complete bull, though.\n\n>A great piece of data that floated around the company: They did a comparative test of two shampoos to see which one consumers preferred. One was white, the other had a small amount of dye in it to add a pale yellow color. Otherwise, they were completely identical. Consumers preferred the yellow one because people associated the off-yellow color with a higher chemical content, ie  it \"cleans better.\"\n\n>[Also, NO, the lather is NOT necessary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/j51ri/chemically_what_differentiates_a_good_shampoo/c297xzx)  There are literally thousands of surfactants that work even better than the common ones (sodium lauryl/laureth ether sulfate) but most of them never make it out of the research lab. There are specific cases where people want soap that doesn't lather (mostly industrial) but for home use, non-lathering soap doesn't sell because consumers have become conditioned to believe that if soap doesn't lather, than it doesn't work.\n\n[Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/j51ri/chemically_what_differentiates_a_good_shampoo/c298g4h)",

I'm Erika and I was wondering if shampoo and conditioner actually do what they say they do. Such as, \"for long and thick hair\", \"for hair that's damaged\", and \"for all of your frizziness\". Thanks!**\n\nThis is a great question, because I love calling out deceptive marketing claims. There are some things hair products can do, and some things they can't do. The most important point to understand is that hair is not living tissue. It has no circulatory system and cannot metabolize anything. Some products claim to deliver vitamins or other nutrients to your hair. This is not possible. Hair does reflect what we eat and what we have in our system, so if you want to get vitamins and nutrients into your hair, you have to eat them and wait for new hair to grow. Existing hair cannot metabolize or otherwise absorb nutrients; its makeup comes from your circulatory system, not from anything you put on it topically.\n\nBut compounds can be applied to the surface of hair. Think of polishing a table or waxing a car. This is what conditioners do to your hair; they add a layer of some coating. Hair strands can split or fray or become otherwise damaged; silicone polymers from conditioner can fill in those gaps and sort of glue it back together, making it appear smooth or shiny. In short, the active ingredients in shampoos are detergents for washing stuff off; and the active ingredients in conditioners are polymers that add a coating back on. They basically do what they say, so long as they don't say they do anything more than that.",

I don't live outside of my means and I make enough for rent and necessities, but I'm poor, so I knew that if I had a serious health problem, I'd be screwed. This is the reality for millions of Americans, even though not everyone sees it.\n\nSomehow, two weeks ago, I got a UTI. I'm not sexually active currently, so my only guess is that bacteria reached my urethra some other way. I literally just don't have money for a doctor visit, nor family who can cover the cost for me.\n\nI tried every homeopathic method and nothing worked. Cranberry supplements, pure cranberry juice, baking soda, D-mannose, garlic, ginger, honey, apple cider vinegar, just drinking tons of water to try and flush it, all with no improvement.\n\nI discovered a telehealth service called Wisp, which seemed like a godsend, but I wasn't able to put aside $65 for macrobid from them until the weekend (about day 12). Come Monday, I'm told they don't prescribe UTI meds for males, and that I should go see a doctor in person. Also that I wouldn't get a refund for 5-10 days.\n\nMy rent is paid for the month, and I have food and water, but I've currently got 45 dollars to my name. Most of what I earn goes straight to keeping a roof over my head. I have no social life, I only go out for work and groceries, I don't even play video games anymore. My landlords like me because I keep to myself and don't bother them, but they're just really not the type of people who are cool letting tenants slide on rent payments. They know if they ever lose a tenant, there's a line stretching around the block to fill that unit.\n\nFrom what I understand, it can cost upwards of $200 for antibiotics and $2,000 for the visit (not to mention bus fare since I don't have a car). I just don't have that laying around. I'm not putting any responsibility for my life of anyone else, but it really sucks that just being poor in this country means if you get sick enough, you're literally just gonna die. I'm very upset.\n\nI know there are people with worse conditions than mine, and I honestly worried about posting this out of fear of being mocked for my poverty. But I just couldn't hold these thoughts in any longer. ",

I deleted most **social** **media**. This has by far had the biggest impact on my life. I keep reddit as it provides me with value and isn't a vacuum. That could be a lie in some way because there are some subs just for my entertainment. I keep close schedule in which I can browse reddit.\n2. I embraced a **minimalist** lifestyle. I got ride of all the physical clutter in my life.\n3. I developed a **before** **bed** routine, my blue light blocker glasses would go on, I would have a cup of caffeine free tea and I would try and read for at least an hour before bed and then meditate for 10 minutes\n4. I started **comparing** myself to what I was yesterday, or a week ago, rather than other people\n5. I decreased the amount of **caffeine** I drunk. I found it to induce anxiety. Try to get back your natural energy.\n\n**Physical Health**\n\n1. I decreased the amount of **alcohol** I was consuming. I went from drinking every weekend, to once every two months. I will be cutting out completely in 2019. Go a month without it and see the results!\n2. I started eating **oatmeal** every day. I would start the day with 1/2 a cup of oat meal and some supplements.  I just love this stuff.\n3. I began to drink only **water** 90% of the time, green tea was the exception. I cut out milk, soft drinks and beer (sometimes)\n4. I began **exercising** with the intent of improving posture and strength. This really had such a large affect on my self confidence. Looks are a nice bonus too.\n5. I embraced more **pro**\\-**biotic** and natural foods. Probiotic foods are incredibly healthy for you and your gut. You will feel and look better by simply adding these foods to your diet. yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, apple cider vinegar. I know these things can be more expensive. If you cut out the bad stuff you can safe some money too.\n\n**Financial Health**\n\n1. I decided to **sell** **everything** I didn't need with the intent of saving every dollar I made from it. This helped me to start a good savings account and/or pay off any unwanted consumer debts.\n2. I began to **track** **my** **spending** and saving every month. I would download my transaction and break my spending down to essential and non essential. I found that when I drank alcohol, my food and consumer spending went up.\n3. I began **saving** a portion of every pay-check. Its simple and mentally rewarding.\n4. I **read** finance and investment books. This gave me a clear insight into how the rich get rich and stay rich. Only read books with good recommendations and from people who actually got success. Everybody is an entrepreneur these days.\n5. I learnt what **money** was, why we have it and what the alternatives were. This gave me a clear understanding and insight into how money can affect you life for the better, or for worse. Money is abundant. Think outside the box.\n\n&#x200B;",

You’re never going to please everyone.  \n\nThe ones here who are calling your ribs overcooked are upset because you (and some other folks) are taking pride is something that they perceive as easier to accomplish than how they bbq ribs.  You can pretty much cook any meat to into a mushy consistency given enough time and moisture.  It’s not hard, you just cover them, and cook them.  But like any hobby you get to a point where doing something that anyone could do is not enough, and you need to fine tune, separate from the pack.  Getting ribs right is sometimes hard when your desired effect is not moist meat mush but controlled tenderness.  \n\nFor what it’s worth, I’m in camp “you overcooked these” I guess because I actually just don’t like ribs peeling away in one bite and disintegrating like that. It’s a weird texture and reminds me of the crappy cafeteria ribs I’d get in college.  pretty sure they would take large trays of ribs, cover with some liquid, and bake them until they were falling apart. Then they tossed them in some bbq flavored hfcs. Im sure yours are seasoned better but I need ribs to not be like that in order for me to enjoy them.",

Here is my low budget routine:\n\n1) Apple Cider Vinegar baths in the tub once every 2 weeks. I have a Publix nearby with a 2 gallon Heinz jug FULL PRICE at $7.99. Fill a bathtub, add 2 cups of apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar), soak for 20 mins, then scrub with a gentle loofah and some pleasant soap.\n\n2) Sunscreen SPF 100 - $6.99 full price. Just adding sunscreen to my face has really improved everything about my skin. Had no idea it was that big of a deal.\n\n3) CeraVe Hyaleuronic Acid $14.99 full price. Slick this on after a shower\n\n4) $1.99 - glycerin facewash (generic stuff, pretty gentle). I use a cotton ball dipped in mineral pil tp remove my makeup and then wash with this.\n\n\nAnyways, I can't afford super amazing cosmetics. HOWEVER, my bare skin finally looks great. And for cheap!\n\nTips:\n\n* Keep your bathroom clean. Wash and thoroughly dry anything that touches your face. Wash your pillowcases. \n\n* USE COUPONS FOR EVERYTHING. Everything on this list has a coupon available. Publix has apple cider vinegar on discount now for $3.99... CeraVe coupons can be had via their website ($2 off, ill take it), its very possible to cut this down to less than $20 spent for 2 months.",

And 2- To get the best effect, you need to do a fair bit of scrubbing with your loofah or cloth or whatever. Too much of this routine too often made my skin feel a smidge too dry. \n\nOnce every two weeks seemed to kind of work best for me. Feel free to try your own schedule.\n\nIts cheap!

Also, another good drugstore product are the Stridex pads (the ones in the red box). These contain salicylic acid which works as a chemical exfoliant.

After that I take about 2 cups of water and pour that into the bowl, put something over top of it and into the fridge until it’s solid, often overnight. Sounds crazy but what happens is the tallow all floats to the top of the water while the impurities of the tallow all sink to the bottom of the bowl with the water. Your mesh strainers and cheese cloth often can’t get those little impurities out like this method does. The next day you pop off the solid white tallow and you’ll notice some nasty brown stuff on the bottom side where it was touching the water. Scrap that stuff off and toss out the dirty water. At this point you have some purified tallow left, if you want to take it a step further though you can repeat the whole process again with the slow cooker and water in the bowl and the next day you’ll find a bit more impurities that have come out. \n\nAt that point I melt it down just to make it easier to put it in mason jars. Turn them upside down after sealing the lids on tight and let them cool down. This will vacuum seal them. Then they go in the fridge. I leave one jar out on the counter to use in cooking.

    "body": "My husband is mostly NC with his mom, contact only when absolutely necessary. He had to get a check from her house recently and she took that as an in to start contacting him via email again. She'd stopped for a little bit, maybe getting the hint that \"do not contact me ever again\" might actually mean \"do not contact me ever again\" but now she's sent several emails a day almost every day this week. (Not one of them wished me a Happy Birthday, by the way, but she did send one about a work out plan. The same day I had to go see an orthopedic because I tore a tendon and now am on PT exercises until it recovers.)\n\nA small backstory: Husband was very recently (like maybe two weeks ago) diagnosed with Type 2 Diabeetus. We went to the doc because his energy was in the toilet, bad bad chronic fatigue. He has a CPAP, so that wasn't it. We thought it might be low T. Because I mentioned he'd also been drinking a LOT they drew blood. His blood sugar level was 495, which if you're not familiar with that (I have the 'beetus in both parents and a sister) is a very bad number. Some people can be 1000 and walking, but some people hit comas at 300. 495 combined with sleepy all the time and barely being able to move is not a good thing at all. He's lucky he didn't have to go to the hospital or get an emergency insulin shot.\n\nSo the doctor put him on metformin, which is apparently the first thing they try before the 'beetus progresses into insulin dependency. Husband has responded really well! We've started blood sugar checks and recently he had one 2 hours after eating that was 153! Which is much much better than 495.\n\nMore backstory: His mom and dad are divorced, but speak regularly and I think they have something of a friendship. His mom remarried (but they live in different houses because I guess even he can't stand her.)\n\nSo now back to the meat of the story. My husband is decently close to his dad and told him about his diagnosis. I guess FIL told MIL, and now most of her emails are suggestions for his diabetes care.\n\nThings like stopping the medication he is responding really well to and just using apple cider vinegar.\n\nOh, did he know that carbs are actually really safe for him and he needs to be eating rice and pasta?\n\nAnd that doctor was so silly telling him to ease into activity while his blood sugar was high to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. Here's a great intense workout plan to lower your blood sugar.\n\nI can't even with this woman. I just looked at my husband jaw-dropped and was like \"You know if you do all of these things you will die, right? Your mom is trying to kill you.\"\n\nAnd I mean I know she isn't like legit plotting a murder but this is just so ridiculously unsafe for him.\n\nThankfully he knows better and thinks his mom is a nutjob so he's going to stick with his medication because it is helping and his quality of life is SO MUCH BETTER (ya'll he cleaned the house, I am shook) and he's happier. He's going to meet with a diabetes counselor and make a meal plan and exercise plan that works for him. Thank goodness he's stopped doing everything she says, because I don't think he'd be around much longer if he did.",

I was diagnosed with pcod when i was 13 and i'm almost 30 now so it wont be a lie to say that i've lived pcod almost all my life. I have always been an overweight person and did try every kind of diet. I did stupid liquid diets, low carb/ keto diet, salad only diet, etc etc and trust me nothing worked ever. Infact it made things worse. It was 6 months ago when i decided to fix the root cause of my weight gain i.e PCOD. I did a lot of research and had to figure things out myself since no doctor helped me. They just gave me stupid birth control pills that dont fix anything. But after working so hard, i have finally cracked the code. I'm 33 pounds down. Aiming to lose 22 pounds more in the coming months. My symptoms have also gotten better. I have less hair growth on my face and body, acne is going away, periods are slowly getting back to track (still struggling a bit) and most of all- i sleep like a baby and have no morning fatigue. Here are the key things that i did:\n\n1. Started eating in the correct order and amount. Reduced my simple carb intake. I always start my meals with a fiber, then go have protein and carbs in the end. And the amount also decreases with the sequence. \n\n2. I take 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before my lunch and dinner.\n\n3. Take spearmint tea three times a day.\n\n4. Avoid sugar and dairy as much as i can (i wont say i have stopped it completely, i still consume these a little)\n\n5. Being more active (40-45 mins of strength train and 20 mins of inclined walk 5-6 times a week)\n\n6. Threw away all packaged and processed foods (this actually helped a lot)\n\n7. Take Zinc and omega 3\n\n8. Eating in a calorie deficit. \n\nThat's mostly it. \n\nLet me know if you'd like to know in detail about something.\n",

Sadly, everything else just speeds up or aids the process but the only way to lose weight is to eat in a calorie deficit. It's scientifical impossible for some eating in a deficit and not lose weight. Yes the pace may differ but you'll lose weight eventually. Initially even i thought i was eating in a deficit but i actually wasn't. Use very less or no oil while cooking, dont snack randomly, use a food measuring scale and measure everything before you eat.\n\nAlso before all this, first find out your Total daily energy expenditures (you can use chatgpt for that) and deduct 400-500 calories from that. That should be the perfect calorie deficit for you.\n\nDrop this prompt in chat gpt and it would help.\n\nI am x year old woman with X kg/lbs of weight. My height is X cm, and i work out for X days a week for X hours. I wish to lose weight, calculate my TDEE and BMR and let me know what would be the ideal calorie deficit for me. \n\nHope this will help :)",

Thank you 🙌🏻\n\nFor Hirsutism or pcos overall, honestly I wouldnt say that I have fixed it completely as it's a very slow process and takes time but yes i have seen a decent reduction in the amount of hair that is growing now. I had coarse hair on my face, chest and abdomen. My facial has gotten finer now and grows back very slowly. And there's a good reduction in overall hair growth on my body. I begaj with getting my androgen levels tested and that came out to be 2X more than the ideal value. I then fixed my lifestyle to reduce androgens naturally. \n\nHere's what i did:\n\n1. Cut down on sugar and simple carbs like white rice, white bread etc.\n2. Reduced my gluten intake (not eliminated tho)\n3. Drank spearmint tea religiously 3 times a day after every meal (this works wonder)\n4. Avoided processed and packaged foods at all\n5. Stopped using any skin products that contains fragrance and moved to fragrance free, non-comedogenic products\n6. Ate a lot of veggies and protein (mainly plant based)\n7. Stayed active throughout the day and worked out at lower intensity (like strength training with medium weights and inclined walks as intense workouts can also result in hormonal imbalance)\n8. Took Myo-insitol (this was doctor prescribed) \n\nHope this helps :)",

I also always proof my yeast separately with the milk and sugar, the recipe just mixes it all in together (not sure if it really matters). After baking, I always brush mine with melted butter which makes them softer and helps the additional toppings stay on.\n\nFor the pepperoni ones, after the baking soda bath, top with shredded mozzarella cheese, then a pepperoni. After baking, brush with melted butter, then top with grated parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.\n\nMade about 35 nuggets",

It's been about 1 year and 10 months now since I started my skincare journey, and about 6 weeks since the year-long breakout of cystic acne along my jaw line cleared up. I was having dinner with my husband who suddenly looked at me said \"your skin looks really clean. Like, luminous.\" I can't express how much it means to hear him say that, especially since I've lately just focused on keeping my skin clear rather than messing with it with too many products in my efforts to achieve \"perfect\" skin. Just wanted to share, as someone who thought I would never get to this point.\n\nEDIT: Adding my routine below, as many were asking.I started with skincare after hearing about the infamous Korean 10 step routine, went on a few benders and am now recovering. For the past few months, I've been trying to find more western, or European, brands to work into my routine - mostly for environmental reasons. The Asian product you see mentioned below are my HG's that I just can't find myself letting go of. My current routine is literally based on things my skin seems to like, and I'm being very cautious about adding new products as I really, really do not want to trigger another breakout.\n\n**AM**\n\nEmbryolisse Lait-Creme Moussant (Foaming Cleansing Milk)\n\nBoots Traditional Skin Care Glycerin and Rosewater\n\nThe Body Shop Tea Tree Imperfection Daily Solution (3-4 times a week, as it is a bit drying)\n\nRohto Melano CC Vitamin C Serum (This guy really helped me get rid of scarring from acne)\n\nCosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (I stopped using this for a long time, as I wasn't sure it was doing anything. Recently reincorporated it again and I love it so much, it's so hydrating and plumping!)\n\nAvene Solar Cleanance SPF50\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PM**\n\nHada Labo Gokujyun Cleansing Oil\n\nEmbryolisse Lait-Creme Moussant (Foaming Cleansing Milk)\n\nBoots Traditional Skin Care Glycerin and Rosewater\n\nThe Body Shop Tea Tree Imperfection Daily Solution\n\nCosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n\nRosehip Seed Oil\n\nOnce a week, I use the AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution from the Ordinary followed by a clay mask (mixed with apple cider vinegar).",

It tastes a little salty which goes well with the sweet from the chocolate, and the drizzle isn't too heavy so the chocolate isn't overpowering like I find with other brands.  I couldn't taste the strawberry very much.\n\nSour jelly beans:  7/10.  I liked these a lot, the sour was noticeable but much less than a warhead, tastes more tart than sour to me but the flavors were great!  I'm not a huge jelly bean fan but I enjoyed these.\n\nAll butter shortbread sandwich cookies:  4/10.  These tasted ok, I was expecting a more firm shortbread and these felt almost powdery.  There wasn't much raspberry filling and the flavor tasted off to me, not expired, just a weird raspberry flavor.  It was also pretty calorie dense for such a small cookie, 70 each.  I didn't eat more than one.\n\nLemon sheet cake:  6.5/10.  After the Chantilly cake I had high hopes for this one, I love lemon and was very excited to try it.  However this cake was pretty dry and what little lemon flavor there was tasted like it wasn't meant for a cake.  I can't think of how else to describe it, it was almost like lemon jello powder was used to flavor it or something.  I really wanted to like this cake so I might buy it next time and see if it's any better.\n\nCrispy peanut butter filled milk chocolate peanuts:  9/10, I wasn't expecting to like these as much as I did but oh boy are they dangerous.  The chocolate coating and the filling taste just sweet enough without over doing it and I tasted a bit of salt in the filling which really boosted the flavor in my opinion.  The crisps were nice, I wish there were more.  Doubling the amount of crisps would have boosted this to a 10 for me.  I'll probably buy them again.\n\nJust the clusters vanilla almond granola:  5/10, I was looking forward to these but to me they didn't taste any better than regular granola.  I think I prefer normal granola to these because I like the honey flavor and the vanilla really muted any hint of honey that may have been there.  Also worth noting I tried it plain, without yogurt or anything else.  Maybe it'll grow over me over time.\n\nSparkling lemon + strawberry apple cider vinegar beverage:  7/10, about average for an apple cider vinegar drink, I like the sweetness you get at the end of a sip, it cuts the harshness of the vinegar, but I think if I was craving that harshness the sweetness might be annoying.\n\nDark chocolate orange sticks:  8/10  I think I was expecting candied orange peel but it's a jelly!  Very tasty, satisfying to crunch down on, the chocolate isn't too much, the orange flavor isn't overpowering, it's a nice combination.  If you like the orange chocolate balls I think you'll love these. \n\nAnyways, please let me know if you guys have any other recommendations!!!",

Mix the soy milk and ACV, set aside. Mix dry ingredients in a bowl, then add the soy milk and mix til combined. Knead the dough until it becomes a smooth ball. Place on a silpat (the original author says to use an ungreased baking sheet but I lost half the bottom of my bread doing that) and use a sharp knife to score a 1 inch cross over the top. Bake for 35 minutes. \n\nAvo toast for 2 people is 1 avocado, salt to taste, and about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder mixed in a bowl. Top toast and add 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 bell pepper, and if you're like my wife and enjoy such things, Simple Truth Everything Bagel seasoning (pictured on the right).",

    "body": "In what you're about to read I'll remove all filters and give it to you straight. This will likely insult some of you (I hope not!), if whatever you read upsets or insults you at any point, stop reading, I don't think you're ready for it.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nHello! Many of you might not know me, some of you might. Before we get any further into this post allow me to introduce myself. Hi, I'm Juno. I'm ~~a grandmaster player with all races,~~ currently the coach of ROOT Gaming and have been involved with many professional organisations and coached players of all skill level for the past 4 years. I wanted to start with this to emphasise that I've seen and worked with many, many people and have seen it all, or would like to think so.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nToday is your lucky day, because today is the day you decide to finally get out of whatever league you've been in for the past however many years you claim to have played this game. Masters in Wings? Diamond in Heart of the Swarm? You only watch from the side line now because you've done it once therefore it can be easily achieved again?  You're old and your brain and fingers don't move to your will anymore? You would be GM easily if you played more? You've got the time to watch streams after work with a beer but tell me you don't have the time to play?\n\n &nbsp; \n\nWhat a load of shit. People will nod with you but no one buys that. Deep down you know it too.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nI can give you the short version, which you can find at the bottom of this article in the tl;dr. People don't buy the tl;dr, people don't know why the experienced players tell you that very same line as if they're mocking you. The long version is what's about to come.\n\n &nbsp; \n\n    THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS SHORT CUTS\n\n &nbsp; \n\nSurprised? No, this guide isn't the one you've always wanted, but the one you needed the most. People seem to be under the delusion that after an hour with any experienced player/coach they're about to see drastic improvements in their upcoming ladder session. This is not true, very far from it. Let's reflect this concept all the way back to when we were at school, for every 1 hour of class material, it's recommended that you spend twice as much time studying that material again to fully understand it. This is the same with StarCraft.\n\n^(not 100\\% true you can hire a coach to get directions for faster improvements. \\*wink wink\\*)\n\n &nbsp; \n\nEspecially more so in StarCraft, every concept you learn must be applied so you build an inner instinct that allows you to switch to that certain action or response without much thought. A game of StarCraft moves incredibly fast and many times so many of thought process becomes a natural response. Form is temporary, class is permanent. A player who has achieved certain level of understanding in the game, they can return after many years of hiatus and adopt to top form in a small time frame.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nYou ***must*** apply everything you learn multiple times to get a better grasp for it, you can't pause half way through and pardon yourself in every single game so you can have a cup of tea and think about your next move -- this is ***not*** a turn based game. You must practice, not just for the theoretical side of the game but also for the practical side. I've mentioned just then that this game is not turn based, if you break that concept down you'll know that any time you slow down, your opponent will be getting ahead. Being unfit mechanically is like playing chess where your opponent gets 2 moves while you only get 1.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nWow, that's a lot of bullshit you already know but dragged out longer than necessary. I know, but that's what this entire article is about and if you feel like you already know everything you can stop reading also. Regular and focused practice is the ***single most important factor to your improvement*** and I cannot emphasise that enough. Now that we all fully understand how valuable practice is, how should we practice?\n\n &nbsp; \n\n    LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES\n\n &nbsp; \n\nPractice sessions consists of both wins and losses. Normally I'd say watch all replays because there are valuable things to learn in every game. Put your focus on watching every game that you lose. This is exhausting especially if it's games you do not want to recount, it's humiliating and time consuming, but it's crucial -- why? Because that's the kind of performance you just put on. The entire routine to practice is to learn from your mistakes and not make them again, holy fucking shit, ground breaking life hack I'm giving you right now.\n\n &nbsp; \n\n*But when I watch replays I don't know what to look for :(*\n\n &nbsp; \n\nGood! That's what I'm about to tell you. So what are some key things you need to look out for you in your replays? ***Your very first key mistake***. What could it be? In a normal game, that would be the point where it starts favouring one player more than other. If you know how to watch broadcasted StarCraft matches you would know that the factors of advantage in order of most obvious: supply, resources, map presence and tech. Watch your game as if you were third party, where do you think is the point the game started falling apart? Which player did what and responded in what way that lead to the disaster? From a non bias perspective mistakes are a lot easier to see.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nI want you to focus on your ***first key mistake*** and the first one only, the rest are very specific situational cases where you were already behind and most importantly ***they could have been prevented***. As the game becomes longer and longer it goes into the unknown very fast where educated guesses would be the only *correct* analysis you can make, eventually your mistakes will reduce down to where you're analysing these, but not now. Plus, it saves you tons of time too!\n\n &nbsp; \n\n*How long should a practice session be? What should I be focusing on?*\n\n &nbsp; \n\nThat's up to you. I'm giving you areas you look into but everyone is different, I won't be telling you exactly what to do. How much free time do you have? Are you very fatigued and unable to perform when you're free? Your practice is as inconsistent as your schedule? ~~If second one is the case I recommend a healthy diet with at least 7-10 cups of salad and apple cider vinegar~~. Well, many factors exist. If you truly want to improve unfortunately it requires time and a schedule that works for you. I never want to say more the better, I always say quality of practice is more important than the quantity. If you're feeling focused and great, get some games in, if the loss discourages you but you still have it in you, stay stronger, stay focused and play it through (unless if you're *really* letting the games bother you, then take a step back).\n\n &nbsp; \n\nAs far as your focus, that's explained in above. Your key mistakes, situations you feel uncomfortable in and any general areas you lack in.\n\n &nbsp; \n\n    BE CONFIDENT\n\n &nbsp; \n\nBe ready, StarCraft is fluid like a free style rap that let's your creativity shine but there are still structures and guidelines you follow. You ***need*** a game plan. You need to figure out before hand whether your rap partner has a less than impressive package, whether they have a chronic fear of birds or some shit or just simply being ready to call them out on their sexuality *creatively*.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nPreparedness and knowledge will improve your confidence, all these things work in great synergy. Know your win conditions, have goals within the game and pursue it assertively and confidently. Too many times I see players who are competent and understand well what they need to do/want to do but don't because they're scared of getting punished.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nGetting punished is the only way you're going to learn why it didn't work, what's worse is not even attempting it or gimping your game play right from the get go because you're a fucking pussy. If you have a play in mind that you think it could work, just do it, every second of hesitation you're falling more and more behind. You can do just as much awful shit to your opponent that would make their blood boil as much as yours have been boiling. Be confident, do what must be done and give them *pain*.\n\n &nbsp; \n\n    ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE\n\n &nbsp; \n\nDon't know something? Fucking ask. How the fuck are you supposed to know the answer to a question if you don't ask? Google is a pretty awful resource when it comes to StarCraft, for example if you type in \"how do i stop 12 pool lol\" in google, you'll find a lot of outdated responses from older expansions/patches or maybe you get a guide on how much chlorine you need to put into your 12 pools. Bottom line is, unreliable. What is reliable are the active members of the community who would be more than willing to answer questions.  Ask your opponent after you lose (sometimes this ends up bad), ask someone who's more experienced, message someone in your guild, ask in a public discord, post on a subreddit, ask a streamer in chat, do ***SOMETHING.*** ***NOTHING*** will happen if you do Nothing.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nI can't stress this enough, there's no such thing as stupid questions. If you ask a question and someone belittles you for it, they're a piece of shit. Now there's a big difference between a stupid statement and a stupid question. If you're ever making a statement, you need evidence to back it up and give sound logic in why it works. If you can't, that's a stupid statement. (Like saying your third command centre should always be a planetary because it stops *rushes.* Yah, I'm looking at you). If you don't know something, fucking ask, if you're too scared to ask, my PM is open for any StarCraft related questions you're too scared to ask in public.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nOne more thing that people seem to miss. There aren't stupid questions but there are ***good*** questions. The answer is only going to be as vague as the question, be specific, what exactly do you want to know? \"How do I play zvt\" isn't going to get me anywhere, I can't explain to someone an entire match up from bottom up without wanting to puke. If you need resources, look for resources, there are plenty. Go to the r/starcraft discord or any of the r/allthingsrace subreddits. It doesn't have to be creative, but ask exactly what you need to know and if you still don't know, ask more!\n\n &nbsp; \n\n    DO NOT RELIGIOUSLY FOLLOW RANKS\n\n &nbsp; \n\nPlenty of platinum players beat diamonds, plenty of diamonds beat masters and so on. Raw MMR and the skill group you're in tells your ***skill group***, not your skill. Your skill is fluid, it can depend heavily on your condition and mood. This being said, short term improvement is not improvement. If you're 3000 MMR and your MMR spikes up to 3300 due to a winstreak or your new found all-in and it goes back down and fluctuates, it's not true improvement. This kind of results are as significant as your girlfriend telling you she lost 2 kilos since last night in the morning. It's meaningless.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nWhatever gimmick you believe in, whether that be a formula or an all-in, kick yourself out of it. Follow long term goals and don't get discouraged if you don't see consistent results. Improvement is not a normal distribution where you can predict its growth, but if you continue to push you ***will*** grow. Please tell yourself this every time before you play. ***Going up in*** ***ranks does not guarantee the skill, going up in skill will guarantee the ranks.***\n\n &nbsp; \n\n    DO NOT EVER JUSTIFY YOURSELF\n\n &nbsp; \n\n***\"First step for a novice to become a veteran is to*** ***recognise*** ***their incompetence.\" - Coach Anzai (Slam Dunk)***\n\n &nbsp; \n\nIn whatever circumstances, never justify your lack of improvement or skill. Never tell yourself you don't have to play because you're \"good enough\", never justify your lack of improvement because of racial imbalance and secretly you should've been at the top all along. You're not, no matter how good you are there are a handful of Asians that can always make you realise how wrong you are. Self justification, procrastination and excuses are the ***most toxic*** attitude you can have, not just in sc2 but in life.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nYou lost because you did something wrong, let's begin there.\n\n &nbsp; \n\n    HAVE FUN\n\n &nbsp; \n\nWell shit, you can have fun playing ***the most challenging and difficult game in the universe xd*** ??????? Yes you can. Joy can come from anything, bonding with your friends over mutual hatred of a race, dropping the manner mules, seeing the ladder points go up, watching your opponent in white hot flames after they get bullshited, whatever. As important as structured practice is, if it becomes a chore it loses all purpose (unless if you're playing for money, in that case it's normal). Have fun, play team games, play arcade -- what keeps you coming back to the game is because it's *fun*. Before you jump into improvement you must first find what gives you joy in this game, otherwise everything I've told you about is meaningless.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nYour motivation to play is a huge factor in your improvement ~~(as well as Azio's elegantly fierce, comfortable and high performing keyboards at affordable prices, links in the description)~~.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nLadder can be frustrating and I think for many people it's not only frustrating but frightening for a lot of players. It is not a stage that you expose yourself on to have people judge you for it, it will only become that if you believe that's what it's for. The ladder is a goal, a realistic goal you can set and achieve and have tangible results to reward you for your hard work. You lost because you did something wrong, it's frustrating I know. But it's also exciting because there's clear rooms for improvements you can make. Everyone can become a grand master, but you have to understand that everyone improves at different paces and only more work can cover that. Sorry, it is what it is. That's why I say have fun! Be more exposed to StarCraft, love it more, and the skill will come with those naturally. \n\n &nbsp; \n\nAfter reading this if you still even have the slightest doubt that you cannot be helped or improved. Reach out to me, I can't promise I'll always be here but I'll be here to start you off. First step is half the journey.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nSo the last thing you need to ask yourself is: is today the day you decide to finally polish the metal border around your portrait?\n\n &nbsp; \n\nThank you for taking your time to read.\n\n &nbsp; \n\nLove,\n\nJuno\n\n &nbsp; \n\ntl;dr - just play lol\n\n &nbsp; \n\nedit: reddit formatting is broken help",

I made a standard marine-vac build while expanding to 2-3 bases, but I wasn't good at macro and I can't macro while micro-ing my units around back then. Both of us lost because I failed to realise the opponent was attacking my partner's base while I was busy dropping marines behind the mineral line. My friend was mad, he saw my minerals at 3k while gas at 2k and he was even angrier, going as far as harassing me on the chats even though I told him I'd improve. I was watching my replay to see my mistake, and realise that I neglected on building extra barracks and SCVs were all idle (he was still raging on the chat lol). Ever since then, I've only played 3 times on multiplayer and never won once. When we went to school, he told our circle of friends about it and he took the game so seriously to the point where he literally stop being friends with me lol (he's really immature it seems). It was embarrassing for me, and the most I did all these years was to watch the pros play on GSL and WCS for 8 years and played Brood War Remastered. All these while after watching the pros play at a competitive level, it made me realise the shit ton of mistakes I did back then.   \n\n\nNow after reading this, I feel motivated to give multiplayer another try and hopefully reach silver. Thank you JunO! I felt pretty embarrassed to say this even though I enjoy StarCraft so much (I played the first SC game at the age of 7 with power overwhelming all the way and one control group lol).",

I grew up in an area where the internet wasn't all too popular and by virtue of that, neither was gaming.\n\nAnyway this dude that I totally liked told me about Starcraft 2 and I picked it up. I immediately dove into ladder which in retrospect was not that great of an idea. I should have given myself a chance to immerse myself into the culture of the game by playing the campaign. Anyway I placed in silver, which for a first time player isn't so bad. I made a lot of mistakes in 2v2 and he would berate me every time. When we played against each other, he'd relish in dragging out ending the game and then proceed to berate me even further. I should mention my friend was an experienced player who was also in plat. He did teach me how to play and was very patient, but then would turn around and just rage at me. Maybe this is why it's hard to let those people go so quickly.\n\n\nThat distanced me from the game for a while. I came back with a fresh perspective and started to play on my own. Do I suck ass? Yeah I do. I practise and own it. However my enjoyment/experience in the game has significantly improved. My advice to you, never ever ever stick to playing with toxic friends. Even as you make more in the future. It's a really bad indication on their persona anyway\n\nFinally, if you feel like you kind of just want to hype up your feelings about the game and immerse yourself in the culture or lore of the game, I seriously recommend playing the campaign and coop. It won't make you as good as practising in MP but for me it was a great way to bridge any bad feelings I had about the game because of assholes in the past.",

CICO is the most important thing, but.\n\n2. There is too much focus on calories in, when calories out are just as important. I went from struggling to jog 30min 8 months ago to doing 2 workouts per day now (cardio 30min + 2hours of jiujitsu) Im struggling to eat enough to maintain.\n\n3. CICO isnt the only thing. If you’re not in a deficit you’ll never lose weight but there are other things you can do to help, like…\n\n4. Sticking to a 10-12 hour eating window. I hear that less is even better, but 10-12hours is what was most easily feasible for me, start eating at 9am stop by 7.30-8.30pm.\n\n5. Sleeping 8 hours per night on a regular schedule. I clearly see that on weeks where i slept less or more erratically, I didnt lose as much.\n\n6. Eating a lot of protein crowds out a lot of calories from carbs and makes you feel more full.\n\n7. No single meal makes any difference. If its your birthday or thanksgiving, eat the 5,000cal if it makes you happy.\n\n8. Apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before eating is a low cost, easy to implement way of reducing your blood sugar spike, and therefore insulin dump.\n\n9. Walking is the cheat code of more calories out. 100cal per mile for someone like me. Walk 6 miles = free dessert.\n\n10. People think Im more outgoing, fun, and social since i lost the weight. Its not just their perception. I feel more confident, fun, and outgoing.",

Ate at a deficit that would see me losing a pound every week, and it was super consistent weight loss the whole way through. I replaced some go-to foods with other options that were lower calorie/had better macros and would satiate me for longer/cooked more meals and ate fewer snacks, etc. I wasn’t exercising during this period (only started working out around February) and I think I lost fat *and* some muscle mass as a result. Even though I lost 40lbs, my frame was still pretty “loose” (I don’t know my body fat percentage, but I reckon it’s still rather high). It was only until I started exercising regularly that I saw the body changes I’ve been wanting to see during this whole process. \n\nIf I could go back and do it again with the knowledge I have now, I would have eaten at a smaller deficit and use the extra calories in the beginning to fuel a consistent workout from Day 1. Sleep is super important for weight loss and muscle recovery and I’d ensure I got my 8 hours every night. I’d make sure to move more in my daily life in general, separate from the exercise and dieting. \n\nI’ve started ice skating for cardio and functional leg work (and for fun!) and it’s been hugely rewarding to feel my quads strengthen up. I can *feel* the benefits of my workouts on the ice and a tangible way that dieting never really gave me. Dieting made the number on the scale drop, and that’s important, but it didn’t get me on my way to a tangibly different “figure.”\n\nI’ve still got a ways to go, but I feel like I’m on the right path.

There are of course exceptions to that, my Peace Lillie’s hate being dried out, but they usually bounce back anyways. One thing that did work for me to get rid of them faster once I controlled my watering practices, was to get DE like someone else mentioned. What I did was mixed it with the water and watered the plants with it. It won’t work right away cause the DE needs to be dry but once the plants dry out the entire planter is full of the DE instead of just sprinkled on top. I came home one day to literally hundreds of fungus gnats laying outside of a plant I had done this too.

Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

Right now, my scalp is loving ketoconazole and salicylic acid. When it comes to rebuilding the skin barrier, I prefer niacinamide and panthenol at the moment because they actually encourage our body to produce/repair its own barrier, which consists of ceramide, triglycerides, and cholesterol.

After some research, it seems that silicone is not really the culprit behind hair loss.\n* Vichy Dercos Dandruff Shampoo for Sensitive Scalp for the rest of the week\n\nDealing with any internal causes:\n\n* I have found a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioner who has received four years of systematic, research-based, undergraduate studies in TCM in a recognized university.\n* He specializes in dermatology and uses therapies that are research-based. I've visited him for 2 times now. We read some TCM research papers together.\n* This is what he told me about my sebderm: the residue redness is due to inflammation and unbalanced microbes on my skin. He has prescribed me with some anti-inflammatory herbs. He said he could refer me to a western-based dermatology for some oral antibiotics if I'd like but I'm very reluctant to take antibiotics which, I believe, only worsen our gut health in the long term. I've been taking Chinese herbs daily for a week now. It seems that my redness has improved, but I guess it will take at least 2 months before I can tell whether there is significant improvemnt\n\nMore on hair shedding:\n\n* Scalp inflammation or an unhealthy scalp would increase hair shedding.\n* My hair shedding has improved quite a bit after using TCM-based therapies. My mother, who is in her 50s, has also witnessed hair regrowth after using these methods.\n* I was a skeptic before but now that they have really worked, I thought I'd share these tips with you guys. They didn't cost much and couldn't really do any harm.\n* Tip 1 on food. These are the foods that are believed to help with hair growth/shedding, according to ancient TCM books: black mulberries and black sesame seeds (preferably roasted and ground). My mother and I have been eating them daily.\n* Tip 2 on lifestyle: Going to bed early and waking up early, ideally before 11 pm.\n* Tip 3 on acupoints massage: This is similar to acupuncture but you can do it at home at almost zero cost. My mother and I massage our Taixi (KI3) acupoint for 5-15 minutes every night. I went to a really famous acupuncturist for hair loss. He has a full head of hair in his 80s. This is what he taught me. The key however is patience. You have to do it every day for at least 2 weeks to see results.\n* Tip 4 on diet: Low carb makes my hair shedding worse personally. Just anecdotal evidence.\n* Tip 5 on mood: destress!! the more we stress about hair shedding, the worse it may become.\n\nIf you're interested in the rationale/theories behind these tips, feel free to message me anytime.",

As for the frequency, my suggestion is to start slow with adding any new ingredient. I usually start with 1-2 times a week then gradually increase the frequency if the reaction is good.\n\n\\- From my research, it seems that minoxidil may exacerbate sebderm and sensitize the scalp if the scalp has not been restored back to health from sebderm. When I was treating my sebderm, I asked my dermatologist if I could use minoxidil to help with the hair loss but he recommended against it. And if you're planning to use minoxidil anyway, I would personally only use it after using ACV as a pre-rinse for a long time. Again, the rule is to introduce new treatment one at a time and make observations.\n\n\\- I have purchased an at-home LLLT device for stimulating hair growth and calming down any remaining inflammation. There is also some research, albeit of a small scale, that says LLLT is helpful for managing sebderm. But some dermatologist recommended to use it when the sebderm has been largely under control.",

Instead, we ask the question that comes to mind most easily. (To me, this is a form of [attribute substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution).)\n\nIn my culture, someone asking OP's question most likely wants another question answered instead: \"Will this be more beneficial than harmful for me?\" But that question isn't one we're experienced at formulating, and it requires all sorts of information about OP that we don't have. For instance... How much of the product is OP planning on using? What would OP regard as a benefit? What harms are most salient to OP?\n\nIn healthcare communication, we're actually trained to ignore Ms. Manners and instead answer a question with a question for this very reason: the first question we hear isn't the question that needs answering. If OP walked up to me and asked that question in person, my impulse would be ask something like \"What have you heard?\" or \"What brings it to mind?\" After all, it's possible OP is just looking for information to discredit their trainer (who might be a total jerk for all I know). It's possible OP knows of other people who have used this product and simply chooses not to share that information at the outset for whatever reason.\n\nIf OP's question really is the question I suspect it is (\"Will this be more beneficial than harmful for me?\"), the *best* information source will be articles of scientific merit.",

    "body": "27F, have had PCOS for over 10 years, was recently told I'm pre-diabetic with insulin off the charts. Due to lack of anything actually useful from my doctors, I started wearing a CGM about a month ago to figure out what’s actually going on with my blood sugar, and… wow. It’s been humbling.\n\nHere’s the stuff that stood out most:\n\nThe biggest takeaways:\n\n1. I spike from stuff I thought was “healthy.”\nLike sushi. Or a wrap. Or fruit (no, fiber is not enough to slow it down if you're insulin resistant). Or literally anything with rice. Bread. All kinds, no, not just white, brown and sourdough too. Any carbohydrate. I can hit 8+ mmol/L (126+ mg/dL) VERY quickly, and it stays high for HOURS unless I walk.\n\n2. Walking after eating is a cheat code.\nIf I walk right after a meal, I can blunt a spike. Walk 10 minutes after you eat. Then walk again half an hour later. Then again an hour later. If I sit on the couch? I’m hovering high for hours. And you can't just walk once, otherwise you walk, sit down and then it springboards back up because of low muscle mass. Weight training is helping this. \n\n3. Dinner is a blood sugar disaster.\nEven a semi-carb-y dinner leads to overnight spikes or weird 3AM highs. Eating late is basically a guarantee I’ll wake up with crap numbers.\n\n4. Dawn phenomenon is real and rude.\nI’ll go to bed at like 5.5, and by 6AM I’m at 6.9 with no food in my system. My liver is just doing its own thing. When you wake up, don't eat. Move. And CHUG water.\n\n5. THE INOSITOL WORKS. I didn't take it for two weeks, then took it. Two days in, it started working. Before I was taking it, I'd have spikes of up to 10.5mmol/L, and since I've been on it, the line has definitively been flatter. I'm sure metformin would have the same effect, because that's what it's intended to do, but the inositol is not woo-woo.\n\n6) Coffee, yes. Milk, no. Coffee does not cause blood sugar spikes for me if I drink it black. Dairy does cause spikes because part of it converts to sugar.\n\n7) DO NOT EAT CARBS WITH FATS. A lot of the time, people get told to combine carbs with fats and proteins if you're going to eat them. This advice is a DISASTER. If I eat something high carb, I get a big spike, yes. But it's easier to prevent and keep down, and it lasts shorter. If I eat something high carb with a fat, the spike is both high and EXTENDS LIKE CRAZY. I'm talking SIX HOURS LATER, I'm still high. If you're gonna eat a high-glycemic carb, eat it in isolation, then GET MOVING IMMEDIATELY.\n\nStuff that’s helped:\n\n- Low-carb, protein-heavy dinners (earlier is better)\n- 10–15 min multiple walks after meals\n- Cutting out bedtime snacks unless I’m really hungry\n- Consistent sleep schedule\n- Apple cider vinegar in water before meals (I thought this was woo-woo, but it actually helps blunt spikes)\n- INOSITOL OH MY GOD\n- Chugging water\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions, this isn't everything I've learned but it's the big stuff.",

So my way around this is, if I have to have carbs, I have them at lunch, then I can take my dog for a walk right after. I also got an under the desk treadmill for when I work from home. If I'm on my lunch hour, I can do whatever I want and not have to worry about work. I also walk my dog at night, so if I have something carby in the evening, I have ways of getting it down.\n\nIf you only have half an hour, I'd keep it light on the carbs and just take 10 minutes. \n\nIf you're commuting, maybe eat before you go, and for example if you have to take a bus, walk an extra stop. It can absolutely be done, but you have to do some planning when you eat the carbs and make sure you do it before a time where you would be walking around. If you go to the gym, eat shortly before the gym.\n\nThe idea here is that activity (like walking) forces your muscles to use the glucose from the carbs immediately, so they're not just in your bloodstream and eventually getting stored as fat.\n\nIf I'm gonna have a treat or something, I eat it when I'm walking around the city with my friends.

    "body": "Is it gross to only wash your hair 2x a week with straight apple cider vinegar? He is trying to fight hair loss and read somewhere that shampoo makes it worse. He refuses to use shampoo anymore, and it's been that way for 2 years. His scalp does not smell good, even after \"washing\" it. He wears hats all day every day and works in metal fabrication. His side of the sheets are stained and his pillow (brand new) is already stained through the pillow case, but that could just be because he works in metal fabrication?? Or sweats at night??\n\n  \nPlease help me get over the fact that this grosses me out (yes I've told him this and he doesn't care) or explain to me that it is cleaning his scalp/hair so I can get over my discomfort and move on! Thank you in advance!\n\nUpdate - \n\nHey all thank you for all the suggestions and comments. I’ve read them all and digested them. Firstly, we’ve been through a lot together, making the solution of “just leave” not my first thought because I want this to work. He’s a good man that has been misled by information, I think so anyway. \nWe had a conversation the night I posted this and it didn’t end well, at all. He gave me the silent treatment after I brought it up and just said “I’ll just shave my head” over and over any time I tried to talk to him about other options. I never said for him to shave it, but he was insisting, I’m guessing to stop it from even being a conversation. He was mad and being not nice to me at all when he did actually respond. I slept in the living room because I wanted to give him space. \nIn the morning he was leaving for work and he said bye and I said that’s all you have to say to me? Then he proceeded to say some hurtful things to me, that I only care about my own feelings, not his and I don’t want to help his problem, but to help myself. When he said that I got extremely sad and upset because he should know me better than that after the length of time we’ve been together. I told him that if that’s how you view me then why am I even here because that’s not how I am at all and he knows this. I think his ego was hurt? I told him that I genuinely do not think what you are doing is helping you nor is it healthy if your hair and scalp smells, and it’s also affecting me more than I’d like so I was hoping we could find something you are okay with that also makes me feel better about the situation. Then he left for work. \nThat night we talked about it again, wasn’t getting anywhere as he refused to consider using shampoo, fine whatever as long as it doesn’t smell idc what you do or use. But it got into an argument about my motive for the conversation again, and only wanting to help myself. Only caring about myself, which I again explained it is about me but you as well. It’s about both of us. Something you’re doing is bothering me to this extent and I’d like to try to find a compromise. He could not accept that as the truth for whatever reason and I have always been a very honest person. At one point I just cut him off and said “why are we even arguing about this? You need to wash your hair, it smells and it’s gross and this shouldn’t even have to be more than a simple conversation, idc if you don’t use shampoo so long as your hair doesn’t stink and leave residue. What are we doing” then we sat in silence for a while, I was fuming. After calming down, he settled on trying baking soda paste with white vinegar, as some of you had suggested, and if that doesn’t work he said he’d try a conditioner cowash. I am okay with this solution, but we didn’t get there without a lot of unnecessary arguing.\nI’m still pretty upset but I’m letting him try to keep his word on what he said he’d try. If he doesn’t then I’ll reevaluate. Thank you all again for your help and comments, they helped more than you think. \n\nUpdate 2/2 4/30/25\nI broke up with him last night. I couldn’t take this problem anymore along with many many others. I deserve someone who will wash their hair and it not be a blowout fight. Thank you to everyone who commented, I’m going to focus on myself and try to have fun with my life as I haven’t in 5 years. Thank you!",
