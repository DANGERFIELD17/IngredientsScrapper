    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

        "body": "I appreciate you taking the time to write this up and the thought and effort behind it. I will say though that there is one part you should seriously consider editing:\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nThis is very incorrect. While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6.

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn’t look like there’s any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven’t tried it yet but I plan to so I’ve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

So I changed it up and my go-to is now Farmacy Green Clean, which I love. Both are great, but I feel GC does a better job at overall removal for me and agrees with my oily skin type.

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

I have no connection to L’Herboflore or Beautibi, other than being an enthusiastic customer willing to hand over a lot of my money. The only things I received for writing this review are firm, bouncy skin and a sore wrist.]**\n\n**[Also, there aren't any photos because it's evening here, and there are too many shadows, but I link to some sites where you can see pictures.]**\n\nOn a trip to Taiwan last October, I sought out the L’Herboflore stand in the Taipei 101 building, eager to get my hands on some sheet masks. Much to my surprise, I discovered that L’Herboflore carries a lot of products that aren’t sheet masks, such as cleansers, a toner, eye cream, exfoliating gel, moisturizers, body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and powdered health drinks. I purchased a couple of these non-sheet mask items that I’ll review down the road (I still need to finish testing them), and I’ve been impressed enough with them that when I saw that the U.S. site Beautibi stocks some L’Herboflore products, I decided to order the Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner, something I regretted not picking up in Taipei. Aside from the fact that L’Herboflore products have impressed me, I was eager to incorporate more Taiwanese products, other than sheet masks, into my routine, since T-Beauty doesn’t get as much love around here as products from Korea, and to a lesser extent, Japan. \n\n*The low-down: what is this product?*\n\nThe L’Herboflore 蕾舒翠  [Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner 水盈潤晶露](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_detail.aspx?series=9&classid=29&id=88)   (hereafter known as Aqua Toner) is a hydrating toner that is part of [L’Herboflore’s Aqua Plus line](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=9&classid=29), which features products made from organic cactus elixir. The company claims that this toner will soothe irritated skin, hydrate one’s skin, and protect and firm one’s skin. \n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n(I don’t know if Taiwanese ingredients are listed in the same order as in the U.S., so I’m not sure how important the order is here; list is taken from the product box, which is slightly different from the Beautibi website) \n\nAqua (Water), Propanediol, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Polysaccharides, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Fragrance, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, O-CYMEN-5-OL. \n\nI put the ingredients into [Cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_479b233703.html). Please keep in mind that just because something isn’t flagged in Cosdna doesn’t mean it won’t be a problem for you. Similarly, Cosdna often flags things that are generally safe as being potentially unsafe as it doesn’t take into account the small concentration used in skin care products. In any case, please do not use this product if you have a known allergy or sensitivity to any of the above ingredients, and always patch test and isolation test new products. \n\n*According to Cosdna, the potentially acne-causing/unsafe ingredients (anything flagged a 3 or higher) are:*\n\n**Propylene glycol**, which is a humectant, receives a 3 for safety. Some people claim that it’s the same thing as antifreeze and that it’s a strong skin irritant. Paula’s Choice rates it as Good and explains that it’s used only in a tiny amount in skin care products (versus the amount you would find in antifreeze) and thus should not be an issue, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does not deem it carcinogenic. You’ll find this ingredient in a lot of products, including baby wipes, lip sticks, shampoos and conditioners, and moisturizers. I’ve seen it in a lot of my other products, and I’m still alive. \n\nThe only potential acne trigger is **Triethanolamine**, which is pretty low at 2, but gets a 5 for safety. What is this supposedly dangerous substance? Triethanolamine is primarily used to adjust pH, but it also functions as an emulsifier. It’s found in various cosmetics, hair products, shaving creams, and sunscreens, in addition to some skin care products. The FDA has approved it as being safe for use as long as it is in a concentration below 5%. Various sources I checked said that in spite of the FDA approval, it shouldn’t be used long term. Paula’s Choice doesn’t seem to think it’s an issue and ranks it as Good, since the concentration used in cosmetics and skin care is low. I don’t know what the percentage is here, but I’m going to assume it’s less than 5%. \n\n**PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil** gets a 3 for safety. An emollient ingredient, Paula’s Choice gives it a rating of Good, though there are plenty of sites that are suspicious of it and recommend that is not be used on damaged or injured skin. \n\n**Fragrance** is flagged as being 1-4 in terms of safety, but we have no idea what kind of fragrance is being used here, or what concentration. I can say that the scent is rather light and dissipates quickly, so I don’t see fragrance as being an issue for most people with this product. \n\n**Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate**, a water-based preservative found in a wealth of skin care products and cosmetics, as well as many other products, gets a 4-6 for safety. It earns a Good from Paula’s Choice, and as the concentration used is likely very small, it shouldn’t be a concern for most people. I like my preservatives. \n\nOkay, those are the “flagged” ingredients. After doing my own research on them, I’m not concerned that I’m about to melt off my face or contract cancer from using this product, but I am not a medical or scientific expert. Use this product at your own risk. \n\n*Onto the GOOD ingredients!*\n\nOur star is the **organic cactus extract**, or **Opuntia ficus-indica stem extract** (also known as **prickly pear extract**). I have no idea what the concentration is. According to multiple sources, cactus extract is supposed to be good for moisturizing, protecting, soothing, and firming. It’s also rich in antioxidants and fatty acids. Native Americans allegedly used cactus to treat burns.  (Side note: it’s also edible, and used in a variety of juices, jellies, alcoholic drinks, candies, and teas). Cactus extract contains Vitamin E, which helps soften skin, and Vitamin K, which helps reduce the appearance of dark circles and promote skin elasticity. It’s known for its anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it good for sensitive skin. It’s also high in essential fatty acids. It’s thought to be suitable for all skin types and especially good for mature and sensitive skin. (There are too many articles here to list, but if you search for “prickly pear” or “Opuntia ficus-indica stem extract” or “cactus” and “skin care,” you’ll find a lot of interesting results.) Spoiler alert: using my own face as a test study, this ingredient lives up to all of its hype (except the dark eye circles, which I don’t have, so I don’t know how well it works on those). I could keep raving about this ingredient, but let’s move on so we can get to the actual product. \n\nAnother notable ingredient is **aloe barbadensis leaf polysaccharides**, which is a known anti-irritant and also helps restore suppleness. My sensitive skin loves aloe, so this is another plus for me. \n\nAnother good ingredient is **panthenol**, a humectant that’s an alcohol form of the B vitamin pantothenic acid.\n\nAnd then there’s **dipotassium glycyrrhizate**, which is a fancy way of referring to **licorice root extract**. As many of us licorice root fans know, licorice root is anti-inflammatory and an anti-irritant and has been known to work as a brightening agent and to help reduce the redness and irritation associated with rosacea and acne. I have mild rosacea, so I am thrilled that this ingredient is included. \n\n**Sodium hyaluronate**, a water-soluble salt form of our pal hyaluronic acid, is another winner. It has a smaller molecular size than hyaluronic acid, and thus is able to more easily penetrate the skin, and like HA, it is able to hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. There are many more great things I could say about this product, but most of us are familiar with the benefits of hyaluronic acid. \n\n**Sclerocarya birrea seed oil**, also known as **Marula oil**, is predominantly oleic acid, and it also contains stearic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. It is an antiaging oil that hydrates, protects, and rejuvenates skin. \n\nSo as you can see, this toner is chock full of lots of great ingredients, and in spite of Cosdna’s flagging some of the ingredients for safety (which doesn’t concern me after doing my own research), nothing is flagged as being potentially irritating, and there’s only one potential acne trigger, with a rating of 2 (very low). That said, please remember that YMMV. \n\n*Packaging:*\n\nAqua Toner comes in a sleek 4.05 fl. oz./120 mL airless white pump that I think is made of plastic (at least on the outside). The only negative I would say about the container is that you can’t see how much product you have left, but I suppose the old flashlight trick would work. The product dispenses easily. \n\n*pH:*\n\nI tested the pH, and it comes out to about 5. Perfectly acceptable in my book for a hydrating toner, though probably too high to be a pH-adjusting toner. \n\n*Texture and fragrance:*\n\nThe product is a clear gel with a very faint scent—it’s hard for me to say what it smells like. I want to say “cactus,” but I have no idea what cactus smells like. It strangely reminds me of the scent of Aussie Sprunch Spray in the purple bottle, but much lighter. I don’t find it overpowering or irritating, and it dissipates pretty quickly once the product is absorbed. I was surprised to see that the product is a gel, as it’s my first time to use a gel toner, but the gel quickly melts into the skin.\n\n*How to use:*\n\nThe instructions on the bottle read (in English): “Use morning and evening after cleansing. Take 2-3 pumps to a cotton pad and smooth over face and neck.” (The instructions on the box are in Chinese and say the same thing.) If you use a First Essence, you may wish to use the FTE first if you follow the “thinnest to thickest rule.” At the same time, I have mixed feelings about this, as this product is a great booster for other products, so if you use the Aqua Toner first, your FTE might absorb better. You could play around with it and see what you prefer. Since it’s a gel, I don’t use a cotton pad, which seems like it would waste a lot of precious product—I generally squirt a pump or two onto my hand and apply to one section of my face at a time, patting in with my fingertips, then moving onto the next section. I probably divide my face into three sections (so anywhere from 3-6 pumps of product used at one time), but then I apply the toner around my eye area as well. I’m liberal with it around my eyes because I’ve had such amazing results, as detailed below. I use it both morning at night. The product absorbs pretty quickly, so you don’t have to wait too long to continue your routine. It might even absorb more quickly than other toners I’ve used. \n\n*How I tested this product + my impressions:*\n\nI started testing this toner back in late February/early March, but when my skin broke out in hives due to an unrelated reaction from a hair product getting on my face, I had to reset my routine from zero and put this toner on hold. This meant I wasn’t using any toner for most of March, and in early April I only used Evian mist (pure water) as my toner. When it came time to add a proper toner back into my routine during the last third of April, I reached for the Aqua Toner, since my other sensitive skin toners (Acwell and Klairs) were near-empty, and the ingredients list looked pretty clean. I was quite apprehensive, since I was still haunted by memories of itchy, angry red hives, and I was afraid of a relapse. Fortunately, the Aqua Toner got along well with my skin and caused absolutely no negative reaction (no breakouts, no irritation, nada). \n\nI tested it about a week over my entire face, and I thought my skin seemed suppler, but to test my hunch, for a couple of days after, I only applied the Aqua Toner to the left side of my face, and I applied my almost-empty bottle of Whamisa Organic Flowers Deep Rich Essence Toner to the right side. The difference was palpable after a couple of days: my left side was softer, bouncier, and much more pleasant to touch, and my left cheek was less red and irritated (I have sensitive skin and mild rosacea, and my cheeks gets irritated just by existing). The right side of my face became very jealous from all the attention lavished upon my left, and so I aborted my split-face experiment before a week had elapsed—I wanted that bounciness all over. \n\nThe more I use this product, the more I love it. I’ve probably used it for about 3 ½ weeks, not including my first testing round that was cut short due to hives. I still have a pretty minimalist routine (no ampoules/essences/serums except for my beloved Shark Sauce), but you’d never know it. I even stopped using my First Essence and am just using the Aqua Toner to prep my skin, and I still have The Glow (granted, Shark Sauce is probably also giving me The Glow, so maybe this comment is less about the Aqua Toner and more about the inefficacy of my current FTE). But the best thing is I have that Gym Mat Effect—do you remember the mats you used in gym class when you did gymnastics? That’s how my skin feels: firm yet soft, and bouncy. QQ, as the Taiwanese say. Now, I have a couple of other products that help with the Gym Mat Effect (Shark Sauce, L’Herboflore Flora Supreme Recovery Infusion Crème), but when I feel my face after applying the Aqua Toner and before applying those other products, I still have the coveted Gym Mat Effect. I feel like a narcissist because I can’t stop touching my face. I’m sad that I’m single because someone else needs to be stroking my Gym Mat Face. \n\nAnother perk of this toner is that it helps to minimize the fine lines around my eyes. I’m in my 30s, and thanks to my oily T-zone, my forehead is still smooth, but I have pesky fine lines in the corners and underneath my yes. My eye cream helps a little bit, but this toner makes the lines almost non-existent (almost…you can still see they’re there, but they’re way less visible). The effect also gets better each day; the past couple of mornings, I’ve awakened to a very smooth, almost line-free eye area, and it’s stunning. I can’t help but wonder what amazement would happen if I had a better eye cream to work in conjunction with this toner (I do have the eye cream in the same line, but I’m waiting to use up my lackluster Whamisa eye essence before I start the new product—I hope the Aqua line eye cream won’t disappoint). This is where the toner exceeds my expectations: I expect my toner to hydrate and prep my skin for the additional goodness that’s going to come its way, and if I’m greedy, I might expect my toner to be soothing, and I definitely expect my toner NOT to irritate my skin, but it never occurred to me that I could expect my toner to help diminish the appearance of fine lines. I thought that’s what fancy serums were for. (Let’s be clear: the lines are still there, but my skin is so plumped with hydration that you can’t see them that well—after all, this product doesn’t contain actives like retinol.) \n\nThe longer I use this product, the better results I see. The first couple of days I used it, I thought it was just an ordinary toner in a strange gel form, but now it’s my favorite step of my routine. Not only does the toner itself seem quite effective at soothing, firming, and hydrating, but moreover, I think it’s acting as a booster to make the products that I subsequently apply more effective. I swear my skin gets bouncier and more Gym Mat-esque each day. \n\n*Who might benefit from using this product:*\n\nI believe anyone would benefit, unless you have an allergy or sensitivity to any of the ingredients, in which case, please stay far away. L’Herboflore’s Facebook page implies that it’s suited to all seasons and all skin types (of course they want to sell product, so why not say that?). I think the people who would see the most results are probably people who are in need of some serious hydration (dehydrated and/or dry skin types) and people who are concerned about anti-aging. I have sensitive combination skin, and it doesn’t make my T-zone oily, and my usually dry and sensitive cheeks aren’t dry and are less sensitive. Some of the ingredients are supposed to be helpful for reducing inflammation and acne, so it might also be a useful product to someone who is acne-prone. I’m not sure how someone with oily skin would react to this product, especially during hot and humid weather. As I said, it doesn’t make my T-zone oilier, but I think I’m less oily than many, and I know some people prefer to use a toner that helps to control oil. Moreover, the weather hasn’t been that hot since I’ve starting using the toner. \n\n*How does it stack up to other toners?*\n\nFor comparison, the three hydrating toners I’ve used in the past year are the above-mentioned Whamisa toner, the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner (original version before the upgrade), and the Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner. The Whamisa is too rich for my skin, especially in summer, and as I discussed previously, it doesn’t give my skin that Gym Mat feel that the Aqua Toner does. I find the Klairs toner very soothing, but nowhere near as hydrating as the L’Herboflore. As for the Acwell toner, I like using it to wipe off residue from Vitamin C or other actives, and the L’Herboflore definitely doesn’t have that “cleansing” aspect. The Acwell didn’t soothe my skin as much as the Klairs toner, and it wasn’t as hydrating for me as either of the other two. (I’ll probably repurchase the Acwell however to have on hand for post-actives cleansing.) \n\n*Where to get this product, and how much will it cost you?*\n\nAs I mentioned, I purchased my bottle from the U.S. retailer [Beautibi](https://www.beautibi.com/collections/lherboflore/products/lherboflore-aqua-plus-moisturizing-toner), where it costs US $48. Beautibi does ship internationally. (And to reiterate, I am not shilling for this site. I love the curation, but I gain nothing by you shopping there. In fact, if you do buy the toner there, that’s one less bottle for me to buy.   )  I have not found any other North American retailer that sells this product. \n\nIf you live in Taiwan, China, Malaysia, or Singapore (I believe Singapore has a physical L’Herboflore stand, but maybe it’s only online ordering), you can visit a L’Herboflore stand in person or probably order online (for example, in China, you can order L’Herboflore off of Taobao—I’m not sure if Taobao ships internationally). According to the official L’Herboflore site, the toner retails for NTD $1500, which is about US $45 (so you can see that the Beautibi markup is not that big). I included the Chinese name of the product above in case you want to do an Internet search, which might turn up more possible places where you can purchase it. \n\n*My rating:*\n\n**Five out of five buckets of snail slime and bee spit**, in spite of the fact that Cosdna thinks it might kill me, and in spite of the fact that it’s the priciest toner I’ve ever purchased. I’m apprehensive to give a product such a high rating, since skin care varies so much by person, but this product continues to impress me each day. Maybe I’m having such good results because my hive outbreak left my face dry, flaky, and in such bad shape that things could only get better, but that makes the product even more impressive to me, since when I started using this product the second time around, my skin was still hypersensitive. I’ll definitely repurchase, though I have the “upgraded” Klairs toner in my closet that I’ll need to try first. \n\nI’ll be reviewing three other L’Herboflore skin care products in the coming week (two others from the Aqua line, one from the Flora line), so we’ll see if the rest stack up. So far, I am very excited about the brand and about T-Beauty, and I regret that I didn't buy one of everything that L’Herboflore sells when I had the chance in person. \n\n*Final disclaimer:*\n\nIt concerns me that someone could read this and drop almost $50 on a product that potentially doesn’t work for him/her, so if you choose to purchase this toner, please do so at your own risk. Remember that what gives one person a Gym Mat Face could give another person a dermatological nightmare. \n",

There's a lot of good info about the new formula on Stratia's Instagram but I'll recap some of it here.\n\n**Ingredient lists (Peptides/Growth Factors are in bold):**\n\n* Stratia Interface (Old Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, **Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-27, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide-78, Palmitoyl Octapeptide-24, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lactic Acid/​Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Stratia Interface (New Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, **Sh-Oligopeptide-1, Sh-Oligopeptide-2, Sh-Polypeptide-1, Sh-Polypeptide-9, Sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Allantoin, Bacillus/Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Drunk Elephant Protini: Water/Aqua/Eau, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Bacillus/ Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Nymphaea Alba Root Extract, **sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Alanine, Arginine, Glycine, Histidine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Valine, Acetyl Glutamine, Coconut Alkanes, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aspartic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 60, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Isomalt, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenylpropanol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Symphytum Officinale Callus Culture Extract.\n\n**General info + thoughts I have on comparisons between the two:**\n\n* Stratia reformulated Interface because some of the peptides in the old formulation were discontinued. According to their IG, they used this as an opportunity to upgrade the formula and have now incorporated a different mix of peptides and have also added growth factors (the ingredients that start with Sh-). This makes the formula quite similar to Protini, at a lower price point.\n* Comparisons:\n   * The two formulas now contain the same mix of growth factors, as well as Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14 and Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate. The main difference now between the two formulas is that Protini contains Matrixyl 3000 (Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7), while Interface doesn't. Protini also has a diverse mix of amino acids in their formula (alanine, arginine, glycine, etc), while Interface does not.\n   * Stratia mentions that their peptides are \"encapsulated,\" which allows the Interface formula to be used alongside other actives (like Vit C, retinoids, acids, etc). Traditionally, from what I've read, peptides are finicky and work best on their own while not being used with other actives. Stratia says that their encapsulation technology allows Interface to be used at any time, and with any active. Protini does not claim any sort of encapsulation (to my knowledge).\n* I haven't tried the new Interface formula, but I have tried the old Interface formula as well as Protini. On IG, Stratia said that the new Interface formula texture should feel exactly like the old one, just with improved long-term benefits. Formula-wise, the old Interface feels a bit more lightweight than Protini. Neither are heavy-duty moisturizers and if you have dry skin, you may need to layer an oil or something heavier duty on top at night. In terms of differences in my skin - peptides/growth factors are more of a long-game, and in my experience, don't produce quick improvements in my skin that I can notice (like with AHAs or retinoids, for example). I use peptides because of their long-term benefits for the skin.\n\n**Questions I have:**\n\n* I'm wondering how much of an impact the \"encapsulation\" technology in Interface will truly make a difference in terms of it being able to be used with other actives - I'm not a product formulator so I'm not sure about the science behind this. At the moment, I avoid using peptides with any other active (I use them on nights when I'm taking a break from tret or acids). If the peptides in Interface truly are protected and can be used with actives (as Stratia claims on its website), then it truly is a game changer in terms of simplifying ones routine. Does anyone have more insight about encapsulation? Can peptides truly be \"protected\" from other actives?\n* Does the addition of amino acids in the Protini formula make a difference for anti-aging benefits?\n* Does anyone have experiences with the new Interface formula? Please share! :)\n\nFeel free to add any thoughts / info about these two products! Thanks everyone!",

DE uses it as well with either the copper peptides or the lactic acid or both (can’t recall).\n\nFor me, DE was my first truly effective peptide product.  It also has ferments which give skin a glow.  It was my first expensive moisturizer and convinced me that I should invest more in my skincare.  It’s very good and very well-formulated in my opinion.  And worth it.\n\nI prefer it over the reformulation of the stratia.  \n\nFor a good baby/ lighr dupe of DE or to get a sense of what it does, you could try be minimalist polypeptide serum.  It’s cheap but gives an effect similar to DE.",

    "body": "About me: 31/m with an oil slick for a face.\n\nI read somewhere that Sephora reformulated their moisturizer and it was a pretty good dupe for LaLa Retro. I have only tried Protini so I can't directly compare the two, but I recently started A-Passioni and wanted a heavier moisturizer for days so my face won't dry out. Previously I was using Clinique 72-hr moisture surge. \n\nIt is based on three types of oils:\n\n-Avocado Oil: Nourishes the skin.\n\n\n-Marula Oil: Repairs the skin.\n\n\n-Rose Hip Seed Oil: Softens the skin.\n\n\n\nIt received the \"clean\" rating at Sephora, which means it's free of sulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, triclosan, and triclocarban, and contains less than one percent of synthetic fragrances. This product is also vegan, and comes in recycling packaging.\n\n**Full ingredients:**\n\n\nWater, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Isononyl Isononanoate, C10-18 Triglycerides, Decyl Oleate, Isostearyl Isostearate, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, Stearyl Heptanoate, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate, Sorbitan Olivate, Stearyl Caprylate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Squalane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Carbomer, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil, Fragrance, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, Gellan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Polyacrylate, Polysorbate 60, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid\n\n\n**Packaging:**\n\nIt unfortunately doesn't have innovative packaging as it comes in a twist-top jar. For $16 I'm not expecting much; the spatula I use for my YTTP night mask has been put to use in this jar instead of my fingers. \n[The jar](https://i.imgur.com/yCysZsGh.jpg)\n\n\n**Consistency:**\n\nThis is a whipped, thick cream. It absorbs nicely within 5 minutes or so. I'm not sure I'll be able to use this in the summer if it's warm without it making me sweat but it is definitely more hydrating than Clinique and doesn't create a film over my skin like 72hr moisture surge does, despite being a gel. A little goes a LONG way.  My skin feels very hydrated and plump. It does leave a slight shine just like any other moisturizing cream. I follow with a mattifying SPF and my skin looks absolutely great. \n\n**THE BAD:**\n\nIt has a scent. When I first opened it I actually gagged, it smelled like it had soured. However it comes sealed with a metallic lid like yogurt and part of the residual metallic scent was at the top. After using it, it smells like a cheap floral/rose scent. Strong enough it will definitely fill your nostrils but not so much that  anyone will smell it on you when you walk by, and the scent dissipates quickly. \n\nI don't have acne or breakout prone skin but this hasn't caused any issues for my skin whatsoever, and I haven't seen that mentioned in the reviews either. I will probably repurchase in the future until the next best thing, and save my money for better quality actives. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

At this point I will add that it's $265 a jar.  I had a few samples when I had my nose done for the scar, and I've used it on cuts, bumps, pimples, basically everything that's bothering me since - it's been a magic eraser.  It makes my face feel smooth, hydrated, bright and literally wonderful and I hate how much I love it.\n\nYou guys KNOW that I am easily sucked in by products, so I was wondering if there are any ingredients that stick out, or if it's AT ALL possible to create something similar for less than $265.  Or even if there are any other similar products that will act the same.\n\nHere are the ingredients: \n\n* Water (Aqua/Eau), C12-20 Acid Peg-8 Ester, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenoxyethanol, Saccharide Isomerate, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Carbomer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Panthenol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Parfum (Fragrance), Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethiconol, Disodium Edta, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Calophyllum Inophyllum Seed Oil, Aleurites Moluccana Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Carrageenan, Buteth-3, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Retinyl Palmitate, Peg-8, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Tocopherol, Rubus Idaeus Leaf Cell Culture, Tributyl Citrate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, Ascorbic Acid, Ci 19140 (Yellow 5)\n\nThanks in advance!!",

Info is [here](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700910/C12-20_ACID_PEG-8_ESTER/).  Basically, I think this is where a lot of your magic happens.  It's a very low-molecular-weight ester of [polyethylene glycol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol).  I'm purely hypothesizing here, but it seems like it would help with water retention and plumping.  PEG has been shown (according to the wikipedia article) to help with regeneration of nerve cells in damaged spines, so... maybe it's worth examining more.\n\nEDIT: /u/ph33rsockmonkey pointed out below that it's often used as a bulk/carrier agent, and not considered an \"active\" ingredient.\n\n3) Caprylic/Capric triglyceride: Found in coconut oil as well.  Here's info about [caprylic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprylic_acid) - the triglyceride can be broken down into the acid on the skin, and it's a bit antibacterial.\n\n4) Butylene glycol: Info is [here](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700861/BUTYLENE_GLYCOL/).  Basically a humectant.\n\n5) Coco-caprylate: More coconut-derived stuff, also probably a bit antibiotic (it's related to that caprylic acid/triglyceride), info [here](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701534/COCO-CAPRYLATE/_CAPRATE/).  It's also listed as an emollient.\n\n6) Cetyl alcohol: Also coconut or other vegetable derived - it's everywhere. Emollient.  Info [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetyl_alcohol)\n\n7) Shea butter: That's doable!\n\n8) Niacinamide: the B-vitamin everyone's raving about for skin brightening/evening the color!\n\n9) Glycerin: humectant, emollient, can get it at the drugstore.\n\n10) Cyclopentasiloxane: that's one of the silicones as a moisturizer and emollient.  Everywhere!\n\nI could keep going but that's the top 10.  Let me know if you want me to dig up more.\n\nCheers, and good thinking!\n\nedit: speeling",

I’ve used both and feel like I prefer the Neutrogena - the Aqua Bomb is a tad thicker but I feel like it doesn’t add anything extraordinary. This is $38 for 1.68 oz so not drugstore level prices but a better deal than B-Hydra which is $52 for 1.69 oz.\n\n* Clinique Moisture Surge line: [Hydrating Supercharged Concentrate](https://m.sephora.com/product/moisture-surge-hydrating-supercharged-concentrate-P417984). $39 for 1.6 oz, same logic as above for the Belif. I’m using up a sample of this and it feels nice but to me, doesn’t have a wow factor.

It is almost silky feeling but it's a burst of hydration that lasts, is lightweight amd layer able if needed! I love the scent though it's not very strong and goes away sadly after it absorbs but it's a good price depending on where you buy it from, it is truly amazing you should give it a go I don't think you'll regret it",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a bit of a haircare/hair science newbie, and I searched the sub and combed through the wiki to try to figure this out myself, but I’m still at a loss, probably because I just don’t quite understand which haircare ingredients do what. Anyway, all this to say that I’m sorry if this has been asked or covered before. I just couldn’t find it on my own. If there are any posts you think I should refer to, please link it below!\n\n\nI recently tried the Pureology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner set, and after rinsing out the conditioner, I could immediately tell that my hair felt softer. After drying, my hair was much smoother/less frizzy, had a lot of body, and was the shiniest I’ve ever seen it. My parents, who have never commented on my hair, even said that my hair looked really healthy when we were FaceTiming. Given that the price of the products makes me want to cry, I’m hoping to get some help in figuring out what exactly is in it that my hair really loves, and I want to see if I can find those ingredients in other shampoos/conditioners. \n\n\nA little bit about my hair:\n\n\nI have thin, low porosity (I think), fine, black hair. My ends are drier and I have a very oily scalp. The oily scalp is very odd to me because I am extremely dry everywhere else on my body, but my scalp has always been oily.\n\n\nI wash and condition my hair every night, wrap in an Aquis microfiber towel for a while, remove the towel, spray It’s A 10 leave-in lite, then dry my hair with a hairdryer. I’ve tried not washing my hair every day, but it just gets too oily by the second day and my hair gets stringy and looks limp. Sometimes I will use dry shampoo, but I find that it just feels like there’s a lot of gunk in my hair and I break out on my scalp. \n\n\nFor the past couple of years, I’ve used Matrix Biolage Ultra Hydrasource Shampoo and ultra Hydrasource conditioning balm. I’ve also used the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo/conditioner set on the days I have to wash dry shampoo out of my hair because I feel like the tea tree helps with the breakouts. For deep conditioning, I used the briogeo don’t despair repair conditioning mask, but honestly that just felt like an everyday conditioner to me, and I would mix that in with the tea tree conditioner because I didn’t feel like the Paul Mitchell one did anything for my hair. Currently I’m using the living proof restore hair mask in the same way. When I ran out of the matrix set, I switched over to the Bondi Boost hair growth shampoo and conditioner because when I finally was able to get a hair cut, my hairdresser told me that I had lost a lot of hair. Although I think it was due to stress and the fact that I couldn’t go get my hair done because COVID and I live in a different state than my home state for grad school, so my hair got really long and I don’t think it was very healthy (but it also looked really good after the Pureology set, and it looks even better now that I got a haircut and feel like my hair is a bit healthier than before). The Pureology was used here and there throughout my time with these aforementioned products, mainly because I was trying to make the product last longer, but each time I use it, I notice an immediate difference. \n\n\nPlease let me know if there’s any other info you need to know about my hair, and thanks in advance for reading this post and for any insight you might have for me!\n\n\nShampoo Infredients:\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Glycol Distearate, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Glycereth-26, Panthenol, Parfum/Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Ppg-5-Ceteth-20, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyquaternium-10, Amodimethicone, Peg-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Carbomer, C11-15 Pareth-7, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Laureth-9, Glycerin, C12-13 Pareth-23, Benzyl Alcohol, C12-13 Pareth-3, Trideceth-12, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Magnesium Nitrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Isopropyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Melanin, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Pentylene Glycol, Bht, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nConditioner Ingredients\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Benzoic Acid, Trideceth-6, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Potassium Hydroxide, Caramel, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, CI 15985/Yellow 6, CI 14700/Red 4, BHT, Melanin, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

There are still alcohols and synthetic components in these.\n\nYou’re starting from too complicated of a controlled perspective. You say you wish to determine what ingredients are subjectively preferred by yourself, and I doubt even the most oil-affluent human on the planet would be able to independently judge each of these 10 ingredients in each bottle. Too much combination happening at once. \n\nAdvice:\nIf you can’t pronounce an ingredient, don’t use it. If you were to use your own judgement system and be successful with finding the right oils, you’d be using natural stuff in the end. Save yourself the time now. \n\nIt was said before, but stay simple. Use your classic base oils, a little essential, and added vitamin E if you’d like. Parfume and Fragrance typically refers to alcohol-based, and you don’t want that on your skin or hair. \n\nSpend $50-75 on amazon and you’ll be able to make yourself quality beard oil for at least a few months.",

I have never tried Kanebo, but I have heard wonderful things in general.  My only concern is that as a second cleanser, they always recommend a foaming style, and I prefer a cream cleanser (Guerlain Creme de Beaute) to follow up.  My skin is dry, and slightly reactive/sensitive, so I need something that will cleanse thoroughly without stripping my skin.\n\nWhich one would you choose if you were picking between these?\n\n**Kanebo Sensai Ultimate Cleansing Oil ingredients:**  Squalane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isocetyl Myristate, PEG‑20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Octyldodecyl Myristate, Glyceryl Behenate/Eicosadioate, Aqua, Parfum, Glycine Soja Oil, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Benzoate, Limonene, Hydroxycitronellal, Citronellol, Alpha‑Isomethyl Ionone, Tocopherol, Linalool, Daucus Carota Sativa Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Aminobutyric Acid, Dimethoxy Di‑p‑Cresol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Methylserine, Niacinamide, Oryza Sativa Bran Extract, Glycerin, Pyracantha Fortuneana Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Silk, Prunus Yedoensis Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Zostera Marina Extract, Cynara Scolymus Leaf Extract, Hydrolyzed Conchiolin Protein.\n\nI use Cle de Eau eye makeup remover and love it, but other skin care products in the line have been hit and miss for me.  I'm also looking at their cleansing oil.\n\n**Cle de Peau Cleansing Oil ingredients:**  ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE･TRIETHYLHEXANOIN･PEG-20 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE･SORBETH-30 TETRAISOSTEARATE･MINERAL OIL(PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM/HUILE MINERALE)･ISODODECANE･PEG/PPG-36/41 DIMETHYL ETHER･WATER(AQUA/EAU)･GLYCERIN･VITIS VINIFERA (GRAPE) SEED OIL･ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL･BHT･FRAGRANCE (PARFUM)･SCLEROCARYA BIRREA SEED OIL･LIMNANTHES ALBA (MEADOWFOAM) SEED OIL･BUTYLENE GLYCOL･THEANINE･TREHALOSE･PEG/PPG-14/7 DIMETHYL ETHER･GLYCINE･TOCOPHEROL･ANGELICA ACUTILOBA ROOT EXTRACT･HYDROLYZED SILK･HYDROLYZED CONCHIOLIN PROTEIN･PERILLA OCYMOIDES LEAF EXTRACT ･\n\nCarita I used to love and swear by, but they completely reformulated the line and tripled the prices.  I'm not sure I see an improvement in the ingredients, either:\n\n**Carita Youth Cleansing Oil Old formula:**  Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coco-Caprylade/Caprate, MIPA-Laureth Sulfate, Laureth-3, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, *Prunus amygdalus dulcis* \\[Sweet Almond\\] Oil, *Camellia oleifera* Seed Oil, Laureth-7 Citrate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, **Tocopherol**, *Glycine soja* \\[Soybean\\] Oil, Hexyl Cinnamal, ***Actinidia chinensis*** **\\[Kiwi Fruit\\] Water**, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Citronellol, Eugenol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, CI 26100/Red 17\n\n**Carita Youth Cleansing Oil New formula:**  ZEA MAYS GERM OIL / CORN GERM OIL - ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE - ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE - CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE - POLYBUTENE - POLYGLYCERYL-10 DIOLEATE - POLYGLYCERYL-6 DICAPRATE - POLYGLYCERYL-2 OLEATE - PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS OIL / SWEET ALMOND OIL - ISOPROPYL LAUROYL SARCOSINATE - DICAPRYLYL ETHER - DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE - TOCOPHEROL - AQUA / WATER / EAU - GLYCERIN - BENZYL ALCOHOL - GLYCINE SOJA OIL / SOYBEAN OIL - GLYCERYL STEARATE CITRATE - HYDROLYZED PEARL - POTASSIUM SORBATE - SORBIC ACID - MAGNESIUM SULFATE - PARFUM / FRAGRANCE.",

I tested my Ole Hendrickson Banana Bright on one eye for a week before giving c tango full real estate of both eyes. Ole Hendrickson is so much better; more hydrating, brightening. Just works for *me*.\n\nI do not like this stuff. I grabbed the box at Sephora without even reading the ingredients, and if I would’ve... I would have never... **never** bothered throwing it onto the checkout counter. I’m not at home right now, but before I left I took a look at the box bc I was wondering why my under eyes were so dry and dehydrated. And I swear it was the 2nd ingredient.... but the website lists it further down.\n\nI read a comment from a redditor that works at Sephora saying that they are getting loads of returns for these. \n\n**DE C Tango Ingredients:**\n\n*Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Ceteareth-6 Olivate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Linoleic Acid, Phospholipids, Ceramide NP, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Ceramide AP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide EOP, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Palmitoyl Dipeptide-5 Diaminobutyroyl Hydroxythreonine, Palmitoyl Dipeptide-5 Diaminohydroxybutyrate, Dipeptide Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Dipeptide-2, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Morus Alba Leaf Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Spilanthes Acmella Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ubiquinone, Superoxide Dismutase, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-38, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Phytic Acid, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Myrtillus Leaf Extract, Tocopherol, Thioctic Acid, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Chrysin, Mica, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Titanium Dioxide, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Sodium Benzoate, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Dextran Sulfate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Steareth-20, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Chlorphenesin, Polysorbate 60, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nLOOK AT THAT INGREDIENTS LIST. I mean how much of those can they actually even stuff in there? It is SO LONG it’s insane. Absolutely insane. I am so sick of returning bs products to the mall. I’m just going to send back all this Sephora shit for real, not only bc it interrupts my Obagi Zo line which is miraculous and actually worthwhile... but also bc they pissed me off when I dropped major cash at the VIB sale and they stuffed all my packages full of every sample I didn’t ask for. Random stuff like bare minerals and all kinds of junk. \n\nI think I’m done with Sephora and all this skincare hype, moving onto dermatologist stuff and sticking with it. And throwing in a few AB products here and there that won’t break the bank. It’s all become too much. It is all just becoming too much guys, for me personally. The marketing hype... it’s all too much. ",

    "body": "I recently purchased the Zotos All About Curls Line as a Deva knockoff and after the first couple of uses I developed 3-4 large pimple-like bumps on the nape of my neck and around my hairline by my ear.  I experienced these same bumps several years ago with the LUS line (I loved what it did to my hair, but couldn't deal with the bumps!).  These are both supposed to be very ingredient-friendly lines, so I'm trying to compare and figure out what I apparently reacting to.  I analyzed the ingredient lists from both brands' conditioners and found the following matching ingredients (see below).  I also ran the ingredients through CosDNA to see if anything dinged as a problem.\n\nNothing I'm doing is healing these bumps (other than time I guess).  I've tried tea tree, clay masks, anti-fungal shampoo, neosporin.  They don't pop like pimples.  \n\nI cut everything out the last week, and last night I added in the Zotos conditioner only to try to narrow down the issue and I have a couple new sore bumps on my scalp.\n\nClearly I have to avoid one (or several) of these ingredients, but I need help narrowing it down and seeing if anyone else has had experience with this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZotos Daily Conditioner:\n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, ISOAMYL LAURATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, GLYCERIN, GLYCERYL STEARATE SE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, HONEY/MEL/MIEL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) FRUIT EXTRACT, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA SEED OIL, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) OIL, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-67, GLYCERYL LAURATE, SODIUM GLUCONATE, CITRIC ACID, LECITHIN, ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL, LIMONENE, COUMARIN, LINALOOL, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL IONONE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLUS Conditioner:\n\n Aqua/Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Glycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-11, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Polyquaternium-7, Polyquaternium-37, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance/Parfum. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShared ingredients from both products:\n\nCETEARYL ALCOHOL, glycerin, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, Citric Acid",

        "body": "It’s unlikely that glycerin or cetearyl alcohol is causing this, at least in my eyes. I do notice that both products have fragrance which can irritate the skin and cause reactions, so fragrance sensitivity or allergy is a possibility. Phenoxyethanol is a preservative that can cause skin irritation or allergies in some people, but it’s likely in other products you use as well. If you have skincare with it and don’t have that issue, I would rule this out as a culprit. It’s very common and wouldn’t be in a very high concentration based on the ingredient list. Same with citric acid, I don’t think that’s it. It’s a ph adjustor in a very small concentration.",

    "body": "I recently bought this leave in conditioner (Luseta Rose Oil Leave-In) on a whim after seeing some positive reviews from other fine-haired people online. However, I am having second thoughts since the ingredients on my bottle are different than what was listed online (recent formula change, maybe?). Furthermore, some of the main ingredients advertised (rose oil, argan oil, panthenol) are near the bottom of the ingredients list, which makes me wonder if their concentration is significant enough for them to be effective. Here are the ingredients as listed on my bottle:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxicane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Polysorbate 20, Polyquarternium-37, Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Behentrimonium Chloride, Benzyl Alcohol, Dimethiconol, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Isopropyl Alcohol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-12, Acrylates/Stearyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Panthenol, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Rugosa Flower Oil \n\nAdmittedly, I don't know what some of these ingredients are, and while I personally don't buy into the notion that \"chemicals are bad for your hair\", I'm hoping I can get some insight as to the potential efficacy of this product. Would this be worth trying on my fine hair, or would I be better off trying something else? I'm also in an arid environment, if that's at all relevant.

DC seems to be a sort of silicone-replacement in skin-care products, but not widely used in haircare (the manufacturers of dicaprylyl carbonate list one hair product containing it called [\"Forever Trendy Grease Hair Balm\"](http://dewolfchem.com/formulations/forever-trendy-grease-hair-care-balm/), which also has a high oil content like your serum; the name makes me think the product stands a good chance of being heavy).  It appears to be insoluble in water, but I can't find exact information about how it interacts with hair (does it cling as readily to hair as standard silicones?); if you use sulfate-free stuff and are leery of silicones, I would use this product in your hair VERY sparingly at the start and see how it goes, because it may or may not be hard to wash out.  The only other issue is that the oils may be heavy on your hair, but that's also something you'll find out by trying it.  There's nothing that should be dangerous to your hair in here.",

So if\nYou’ve used these or know a lot about the science of vitamin c formulas, I’d love to hear your opinions!! \n\n\n\nExuviance Vitamin C Capsules\n\nSo this particular vitamin C is Anhydrous , meaning it is a waterless formula. I have heard that ascorbic acid is much more stable in waterless formulas and that the ph level is not near as important. This comes in capsules that u twist the top off and squeeze out the serum which is almost a cream consistency. The capsules keep the ascorbic acid stable preventing any air or light from coming into contact with the active ingredient. I do apply a ph lowering facial mist prior to apply this just to be safe. I’ve heard thought that anhydrous vitamin c formulas have a lower % of absorption, meaning the lack of water causes less of the active ingredient to be absorbed into your skin. So even tho this is a 20% formula, being anhydrous, it isn’t all getting into your skin. It has dimethicone as the first ingredient so it does feel like a little product is left in the skin and doesn’t completely absorb. But I can feel the tingling when I apply it so I feel like I can feel it working. Here are the ingredients: Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Trisiloxane, Dimethiconol, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Vinyldimethyl/ Trimethylsiloxysilicate/ Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate,acetyl Tyrosinamide, Diethylhexyl Syringylide- Nemalonate, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride\n\n\n\nDrunk Elephant C-Firma (reformulated version)\n\nThis version is formulated with ascorbic acid, vitamin E and ferulic acid. It is sold in 2 bottles, the serum base and the ascorbic acid powder. When you’re ready to begin use, you mix it all together so you’re getting the freshest product possible when u start using it. It has a low ph level of 2.5, silicone free and supposedly a formula close to the infamous Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. I’ve only used this one a handful of times but it is pretty tacky and dries down quickly so it has to be applied faster than you’d expect. Here are the ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Ascorbic Acid, Laureth-23, Glycerin, Tocopherol, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Ferulic Acid, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Punica Granatum Fruit Ferment Extract, Propanediol, Gluconolactone, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Glutamylamidoethyl Imidazole, Tetrahydrobisdemethoxydiferuloylmethane, Tetrahydrodemethoxydiferuloylmethane, Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, Pentylene Glycol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Caprylyl Glycol, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n\n\nI apply my vitamin c serum at night. I’m also using tazorac (tazarotene gel .1%) and tretinoin .1% cream alternating nightly between the tazorac and tret. I apply the retinoid to bare skin, let it sit for 30-60 mins, then I lightly apply a ph lowering mist, then apply the vitamin c serum, let it sit for 30 mins before moving on. Is this an ok order? I’m most concerned with the retinoid results and want to supplement the retinoid with vitamin c. Any help is great let appreciated!! Thanks!",

It goes by other names like sodium hyaluronate. This is such a miracle product for so many people and is in so many products. I even made sure it’s not in my shampoo and conditioner and that has helped with chest and back acne.\n\nThis might not be what is causing your break outs but I’d recommend using only sensitive skin products for a few weeks to pin point what it is. Look up some sensitive Korean or French brands. Then slowly add simple serums with few ingredients.",

        "body": "I also break out from CeraVe. I have hormonal acne and used it two days in a row. Started noticing some clogged pores and then came my period and all hell broke loose. Worst break out in a long time. All because I was concerned about being slightly dehydrated. I think it could be Ceteareth-20,  Cetyl Alcohol and Cetearyl Alcohol so I put away all my products with these ingredients. Also read that Stearic acid could clog pores. \n\nNow after reading the comments I'm no longer so sure. Of course it could be the coconut derivatives? I will try to avoid these also :( I hope you figure it out!",
