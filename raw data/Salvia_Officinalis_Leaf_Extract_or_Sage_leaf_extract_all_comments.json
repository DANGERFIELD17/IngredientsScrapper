I have pssd symptoms and they've gotten progressively worse over time, which makes me think there is an on-going source of either autoimmune or actual infection driving it. I thought I had sibo years ago, but seemed to put it in remission with betaine hlc and enzymes. I never did a \"kill\" phase. When I attempted to take Monolaurin and Cleanzyme, I had the most shatteringly painful herx reaction with nausea. My GI symptoms finally came back, and now I'm wondering if this was sibo related all along. I'm just about to do the test. \n\nDid you discover any strong detox reactions with these antimicrobials? I'm looking at yt videos about how to avoid die off reactions, and some holistic people seem to be suggesting liver support/Tudca to help stimulate bile flow, so that the toxins that the liver sequesters from the die off are successfully able to be excreted through the bile and into the colon. Did you have to titrate the dose up slowly? I suspect I'm methane dominant since I don't have any diarrhea, but will find out. I'm hopeful to finally have a chance to get my old life back.",

I like the concept of lip tints but they haven't really worked for me as my lips are forever dry regardless of hydration or treatment. \n\nI have mixed feelings about holiday and seasonal collections.   I understand that different shades work for different seasons,  but brands should have a decent shade selection available at all times.   It also creates a false sense of scarcity that tricks people into thinking they need to be buying new makeup at all times to squeeze money out of us while we never finish a product.

I won't list the product here. (No changes in his medications)I'm listing the product ingredients and want to know what could possibly the reason for actual hairgrowth from people who know it better. There seems to be no Minox in there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \"Skrzypovita Serum Pro\", because of all the downvotes here you have it holy xd\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story is below the Ingredients. It's the same Ingredient order as on the package.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Propanediol, Arginine, Lactic Acid, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycerin, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Lamium Album Extract, Salvia Officinalis Leaf Extract, Pinus Sylvestris Bud Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Extract, Arctium Majus Root Extract, Citrus Limon Peel Extract, Hedera Helix Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tropaeolum Majus Flower Extract, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract, Betula Alba Leaf Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Actinidia Chinensis Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus Fruit Extract, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Biotin, Glycoproteins, Ethoxydiglycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pyridoxine HCI, Panthenol, Zinc Chloride, Acetyl Cysteine, Glutamine, Methionine, Saccharomyces Lysate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylalycerin. Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Lactate\n\nSo my Dad is 90% bald on the top with little small hair in the crownarea and some on the front between the temples. Huge donorarea tho. He has been like this for the last 20 years. But somehow he just noticed like a year ago that he went bald lol when I complained about my own hair. Even his ID 10 years ago shows him being in the same state as he is now.So he bought some random shampoo's and gave up on them. But he keeps using a \"serum\" which is just advertised in my land. And two weeks ago he said, \"my hair is getting back\" and my Mom agreed that he is really growing some hairs.I ignored it knowing how hard it actually is to get it back after spending thousand of hours reading about hairloss.But I remember checking his scalp from time to time, just cuz fkit I'm balding and wanted to see what I will end up with ok xd. And he is getting more hairs, his crownarea is of course thin af, but there are more hairs then some months ago.The package of the product says the same thing that we know from Minox. \"Takes 2-4months of use to see any difference and that it puts hairs into the anagen phase and keeps them there for longer period of time. Reduces hairloss up to 60%\"But there is no minox in here so what could be the reason it's doing any work?\n\nI buzzed my hair yesterday, thinking to try it out cuz I've lost the fight anyway. But I don't want to put something up there when I've no idea what it is for the rest of my days.",

    "body": "**Troiareuke Acsen Pore Control Mask**\n\nThis brand has been on my radar for quite some time. A lot of my favorite YouTube personalities rave about Troiareuke not only for their take-home products…but also for their chain of spas in Seoul. Their signature facial called the “Troipeel” involves little plant-based micro needles being pushed into the skin. While it looks really painful…so many people love the brightening, lifting, and resurfacing benefits. \n\nI kept myself from diving into the products mainly because of the prices compared to other K-Beauty brands (at least the ones I was familiar with early on). And while I do think some of their offerings are still on the pricey side…I don’t feel the same “sticker shock” as I did a couple of years ago. Of course, that is personal opinion…everyone has a different price range/budget they need to stick to.\n\nAnyway, all of that is to say that the first Troiareuke product I decided to go for was the Acsen Pore Control Mask. The Acsen line is focused on acne prone/sensitive skin. Ac(ne)sen(sitive)…you get the idea. The Pore Control Mask focuses on lessening the appearance of large pores while also removing excess oil/sebum and calming the skin. Pretty run-of-the-mill claims from a clay based mask…but I’ve found it hard to find one that truly does it all.\n\nFeatured ingredients here include Kaolin Clay, Bentonite Clay, Moroccan Lava Clay, Yuzu Fruit Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sage Leaf Extract, and Lotus Flower Extract. There is added fragrance here (which doesn’t really line up with the claim to target sensitive skin) and the scent is quite strong. I cant really place it to be honest LOL! It is a powdery/floral scent that I don’t hate…but I don’t love. It’s strong enough that some people may not be able to handle this mask.\n\nApplication of this mask is once again pretty typical for a clay based mask. I use a brush to apply several dollops of product on to my skin…but fingers are fine too. One of the main differences I have found with the Acsen Pore Control Mask though is just how easily and smoothly it applies. The texture of this mask is so unique and just feels more “fine” in a way. Other clay masks can be hard to spread around and even feel clumpy…this is like a really smooth/near lotion feel.\n\nOnce on, this mask dries rather quickly (you only need a thin layer). Just 5-10 minutes and this product dries down completely. I have used a few clay masks recently that remain damp during application and rinsing which I have really liked. But, this clay mask (while it hardens like a more traditional mask) feels plenty comfortable to me. It has a bit more flex and doesn’t feel like it will flake off with the slightest movement.\n\nWhen it comes time to rinse/remove…the Troiareuke Acsen Pore Control Mask really shines. Even the rinsing process alone is impressive LOL! The “cast” that is created when this product dries breaks up incredibly well and allows the mask to risne off/emulsify super easily. This isn’t a product that you have to scrub or use tons of water to fully remove. It just kind of…melts away.\n\nAnd the final result is just awesome! I don’t know if the Kaolin and Bentonite Clays are just used in a unique way here, or if they are more finely milled than usual…but my skin is left looking so soft and even toned. Even more impressive is that my larger pores and general skin texture seems to be so much more even and “blurred” after using the Acsen Pore Control Mask. It almost has a cosmetic effect in that its so immediate and impressive. There is also a noticeable brightening and calming effect as well.\n\nOver time I have taken to moving this product to my AM routine just so I can have that “look” or benefit during the daytime rather than wasting it in bed. I cant wait to use this product when quarantine is over LOL! Using it in the PM is totally fine too as I do find the benefits from this product to be rather long lasting. In addition to the immediate results my skin just seems more balanced and I don’t notice the patches of oily skin on my t-zone that I normally get by the end of the day. Once again, there is something they did with the clays here to make them seem more effective and just “elegant” in application.\n\nIt only took about three uses of the Troiareuke Acsen Pore Control Mask for me to fall in love with it LOL! It’s that impressive. I’ve still got about half of my first tube left after one month and I already have a backup waiting. Outside of an Elizavecca Clay Bubble Mask “something or other” that I am using as part of a collaboration review…the Acsen Control Mask is the only other clay product I have in my stash and I don’t think I’ll be exploring other options. This really is one of the more impressive clay masks that I have ever used and I think I’m all set on hunting for more.\n\nThe price did seem a bit steep at first…especially compared to other “bulk” clay masks like the Aztec Secret. But, after using clay products in a higher price point from Peach & Lily and Youth To The People (both of which I loved) and just being THAT much more impressed with the immediate and long-term results from the Acsen Pore Control Mask…I’m ready to put a ring on it. \n\nThe only thing that could make this love connection better would be the omission of added fragrance. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Kaolin, Propanediol, Bentonite, Butylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Magnesium, Aluminum Silicate, Dimethyl Sulfone , Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Moroccan Lava Clay, Betaine, Allantoin, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella asiatica extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Fragrance\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $38.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-pore-control-mask](https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-pore-control-mask)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/580h1sqyodv41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f86a4273f5d899bded1ad5145041500b0b5851fd",

        "body": "Hi there! \n\nIt seems like you may be looking for some information on Dermarolling/Dermastamping. \n\nDermarolling can improve the appearance of atrophic scarring when done correctly. \n\nHowever, there are several risks and I'd like to warn you about them: \n\n* You should not be doing this every day. When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best.\n\n* The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.\n\n**Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!**\n\n*If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.

    "body": "Product: Sweet Chef Ginger + Kombucha Vitamin D Chill Mist\n\nProduct Size: 75 ML\n\nConsistency Of Product: Thin/Watery Mist Fluid - Dispenses From A Pump Spray Top\n\nProduct Start Date: July 8th 2019 (Didn’t quite last a month…see below)\n\nWhen I Use It: Morning Routine - Throughout The Day As Needed\n\nHow I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As A Facial Mist: I spray 4-6 pumps of Product onto my Skin holding the bottle 4-6 inches away. I make sure to get an even layer of Product across my entire Face and Neck. Then, I gently pat the Product into my Skin to ensure proper absorption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As A Toner: I spray the Product in the same manner as above. However, to complete the 7-Skin Method I will repeat the process several times until my Skin is sufficiently hydrated and dewy before moving onto my Essence. So it is basically…spray, pat, spray, pat, spray, pat…and so on. \n\nWhy I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Honestly, I didn’t really read too much into the Ingredients List or advertised benefits before picking this Product up. I really like the idea of Glow Recipe bringing a Sister Brand to retailers like Target at a lower price point. I think that this allows more people to have access to K-Beauty/interesting Skincare so I want to support their efforts. All of this is to say I’ll probably buy anything they come out with to try at least once LOL!\n\nOverall Review:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I just want to take a moment to appreciate the naming and overall Branding of Sweet Chef Products. I think these Products are some of the most appealing (and delicious sounding LOL) that I have ever used. Even the packaging is eye catching and cute. Sweet Chef managed to take that cutesy/almost cartoon-like appeal of some K-Beauty Brands and elevate it. It makes we want to put on a colorful Sweet Chef Chef’s Hat every time I use their Products LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Specific to the Ginger Kombucha + Vitamin C Chill Mist…this Product uses a typical pump style cap on top of a plastic bottle. Although the Mist that is dispensed is quite fine…it’s not quite the Ultra-Fine “Fog” Mist that the Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Mist provided. I’m curious as to why Glow Recipe didn’t share that “Fog Style” cap with Sweet Chef as it is just soooo nice LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* My first application of this Product left me wildly impressed with the scent. There is a bright lemon/citrus scent that is immediately apparent…but the spiciness of the Ginger is noticeable as well. Seriously, the fact that Sweet Chef managed to create this scent without the use of Synthetic Fragrances is kind of amazing. If you asked me to imagine what a Ginger and Lemon Kombucha would smell like…this Chill Mist is pretty close! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This lovely scent is provided by a Formula that includes Ginger Root Extract, Fermented Black Tea Extract, as well as Sage Leaf Extract (see Full Ingredients List below). I love these three Ingredients for their calming/soothing and brightening properties. Cucumber Extract makes an appearance as well for a hydration and cooling boost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* With all of those wonderful Ingredients…you would probably expect this to be a slam dunk Product right??? Well, there is something missing from this Formula that has me thinking otherwise. Ever since I experienced the Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-Fine Mist and the Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Essence Mist…I’ve come to appreciate Facial Mists that blend both watery hydration and emollient/oil based nourishment into one Product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Each one of those Facial Mists includes some kind of emollient/oil Ingredient that requires the Product to be shaken before use. For me, there is a clear difference in the application, feeling once applied, and overall result with these types of Mists vs. a Facial Mist that omits the “heavier” Ingredients. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* With just a few applications of the Sweet Chef Ginger + Kombucha Vitamin D Chill Mist I knew I wasn’t going to fall for it the way I did for the Watermelon Glow Mist. Sure, the scent was fantastic and the initial feeling of cooling hydration was great…but the effect dissipated much more quickly compared to a Mist that contained some kind of emollient/occlusive Ingredient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Given more time…I didn’t really notice any difference in my Skin in regards to brightening or soothing. What I did find is that I found myself reaching for the Ginger + Kombucha Vitamin D Chill Mist more frequently than I had when using the Watermelon Glow or Acwell Facial Mists. For me, this Product was starting to seem more and more like a hydrating Toner than anything else…so I decided to change my approach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I ended up finishing this Product while using it as my AM Toner. As a Toner…I was much happier with my results. Layering this Product was a breeze thanks to the pump application. Just a simple pump, pat, and repeat left my Skin looking super hydrated and dewy…and that “heavier” feeling as compared to using it as a throughout. The day Mist just seemed more impactful and beneficial to my Skin. I immediately followed this step up with an Essence and Moisturizer to lock everything in…something I felt this Chill Mist wasn’t able to accomplish on its own.\n\nWell, just under a month of use and that is where I left this Product. As a Facial Mist…I honestly think it is lacking the “locking-in”/emollient quality that I feel is imperative to a results driven Facial Mist. Sure, it may smell good and feel good at the point of application. But, if there isn’t anything in the Formula to “hold onto” that moisture…it seems like the majority of the Fluid (and all the benefits from it) tend to make their way back out into the atmosphere. Keep in mind that this can be avoided by having a Moisturizer handy right after you use this Facial Mist. For me…that just wasn’t my intention.\n\nAs I mentioned above, this Product made a much better hydrating/brightening Toner (for me). But one thing to consider is price vs. quantity. In my experience with K-Beauty Brands I have used quite a few Toners that offer a similar result and quality…for far less. Even slipping the Skinfood Bitter Green Toner into a spray bottle would most likely be a better (and more affordable) route. \n\nOverall my thoughts are that you can pretty easily work your way around needing to use this Facial Mist. If a thin/watery/refreshing hydration boost during the day is what your are after…then find yourself a travel spray bottle to fill with your current hydrating Toner. If a more long-lasting “don’t have to think about my Dry Skin/I feel like I’m about to crack…HELP!” Product is what you crave…then the Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-Fine Mist will be your go-to.\n\nIt smells great…it feels great for the first 30-60 seconds…but after that it was kind of a let down (for me). I doubt I will be coming back to this Product and wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Glycerin, C12-14 Pareth-12, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Saccharomyces/Xylinum/Black Tea Ferment, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Althaea Rosea Flower Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Methyl Cyclodextrin, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, 7-Dehydrocholesterol, Potassium Sorbate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yc1cgbaxq3p41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8adfac41a0c5aa8ca49045486d8cf51bf7bafa12",

    "body": "**Troiareuke Acsen Pore Control Mask**\n\nThis brand has been on my radar for quite some time. A lot of my favorite YouTube personalities rave about Troiareuke not only for their take-home products…but also for their chain of spas in Seoul. Their signature facial called the “Troipeel” involves little plant-based micro needles being pushed into the skin. While it looks really painful…so many people love the brightening, lifting, and resurfacing benefits. \n\nI kept myself from diving into the products mainly because of the prices compared to other K-Beauty brands (at least the ones I was familiar with early on). And while I do think some of their offerings are still on the pricey side…I don’t feel the same “sticker shock” as I did a couple of years ago. Of course, that is personal opinion…everyone has a different price range/budget they need to stick to.\n\nAnyway, all of that is to say that the first Troiareuke product I decided to go for was the Acsen Pore Control Mask. The Acsen line is focused on acne prone/sensitive skin. Ac(ne)sen(sitive)…you get the idea. The Pore Control Mask focuses on lessening the appearance of large pores while also removing excess oil/sebum and calming the skin. Pretty run-of-the-mill claims from a clay based mask…but I’ve found it hard to find one that truly does it all.\n\nFeatured ingredients here include Kaolin Clay, Bentonite Clay, Moroccan Lava Clay, Yuzu Fruit Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sage Leaf Extract, and Lotus Flower Extract. There is added fragrance here (which doesn’t really line up with the claim to target sensitive skin) and the scent is quite strong. I cant really place it to be honest LOL! It is a powdery/floral scent that I don’t hate…but I don’t love. It’s strong enough that some people may not be able to handle this mask.\n\nApplication of this mask is once again pretty typical for a clay based mask. I use a brush to apply several dollops of product on to my skin…but fingers are fine too. One of the main differences I have found with the Acsen Pore Control Mask though is just how easily and smoothly it applies. The texture of this mask is so unique and just feels more “fine” in a way. Other clay masks can be hard to spread around and even feel clumpy…this is like a really smooth/near lotion feel.\n\nOnce on, this mask dries rather quickly (you only need a thin layer). Just 5-10 minutes and this product dries down completely. I have used a few clay masks recently that remain damp during application and rinsing which I have really liked. But, this clay mask (while it hardens like a more traditional mask) feels plenty comfortable to me. It has a bit more flex and doesn’t feel like it will flake off with the slightest movement.\n\nWhen it comes time to rinse/remove…the Troiareuke Acsen Pore Control Mask really shines. Even the rinsing process alone is impressive LOL! The “cast” that is created when this product dries breaks up incredibly well and allows the mask to risne off/emulsify super easily. This isn’t a product that you have to scrub or use tons of water to fully remove. It just kind of…melts away.\n\nAnd the final result is just awesome! I don’t know if the Kaolin and Bentonite Clays are just used in a unique way here, or if they are more finely milled than usual…but my skin is left looking so soft and even toned. Even more impressive is that my larger pores and general skin texture seems to be so much more even and “blurred” after using the Acsen Pore Control Mask. It almost has a cosmetic effect in that its so immediate and impressive. There is also a noticeable brightening and calming effect as well.\n\nOver time I have taken to moving this product to my AM routine just so I can have that “look” or benefit during the daytime rather than wasting it in bed. I cant wait to use this product when quarantine is over LOL! Using it in the PM is totally fine too as I do find the benefits from this product to be rather long lasting. In addition to the immediate results my skin just seems more balanced and I don’t notice the patches of oily skin on my t-zone that I normally get by the end of the day. Once again, there is something they did with the clays here to make them seem more effective and just “elegant” in application.\n\nIt only took about three uses of the Troiareuke Acsen Pore Control Mask for me to fall in love with it LOL! It’s that impressive. I’ve still got about half of my first tube left after one month and I already have a backup waiting. Outside of an Elizavecca Clay Bubble Mask “something or other” that I am using as part of a collaboration review…the Acsen Control Mask is the only other clay product I have in my stash and I don’t think I’ll be exploring other options. This really is one of the more impressive clay masks that I have ever used and I think I’m all set on hunting for more.\n\nThe price did seem a bit steep at first…especially compared to other “bulk” clay masks like the Aztec Secret. But, after using clay products in a higher price point from Peach & Lily and Youth To The People (both of which I loved) and just being THAT much more impressed with the immediate and long-term results from the Acsen Pore Control Mask…I’m ready to put a ring on it. \n\nThe only thing that could make this love connection better would be the omission of added fragrance. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Kaolin, Propanediol, Bentonite, Butylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Magnesium, Aluminum Silicate, Dimethyl Sulfone , Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Moroccan Lava Clay, Betaine, Allantoin, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella asiatica extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Fragrance\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $38.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-pore-control-mask](https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-pore-control-mask)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zluenq26pdv41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4b10493b9bf002c2491c0c187d945795e461fe9",

It has a nice thick consistency and the white cast it leaves once it soaks in is actually nice. It brightens my skin tone and slightly hides my acne scars. I love reading ingredients and knowing what is inside my skincare products, but this product has proven more difficult since its Korean and not as popular in the US as some asian skin care lines. I looked it up online and I haven't been able to find any reviews, let alone the ingredients in English. I found the ingredient list in Korean on the [IPKN website](http://ipkn.co.kr/ipkn/product/goods/product_view.asp?GoIdx=100388)\nand plugged it into google translate. Below is what google plopped out, and I was hoping you wonderful people with more skin care knowledge than I could take a look at this list for any alarming or harmful ingredients. \n\n\n>Water, penta siloxane cycles, methoxy cinnamate in the chilhek silme, glycerin, whack on the chilhek silsal rate, zinc oxide, dimethicone PEG -10, cycle menu dimethicone, titanium dioxide, di propylene glycol, Discover Te Des uranium hectorite , apple extract, daisy flower extract, Western Songak extract, line thyme oil, cactus extract, Citric acid, peppermint leaf extract, bilberry fruit extract, sugar cane extract, rosemary leaf extract, ginger extract, sage leaf extract, avocado fruit extract, Chamomile flower extract, grape seed extract, lemon extract, orange extract, sugar maple extract, magnesium sulfate, taelkeu, diphenyl dimethicone / Vinyl diphenyl dimethicone / silsesquioxane cross-polymer, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum stearate, dimethicone dimethicone / vinyl dimethicone cross-polymer, methyl dimethicone, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, butyl paraben, chromium oxide green\n\n\nThanks y'all!",

    "body": "After years of no scalp issues, I'm suddenly getting lots of dandruff! Not only that, but I'm also getting patches of red skin on different parts of my scalp. They are rather itchy.\n\nI can only think of 2 things causing it:\n\n1. Hard Water\n2. [Bumble & Bumble Sunday clarifying shampoo](https://www.bumbleandbumble.com/product/19047/219/care/shampoos/sunday-shampoo)\n\nMy new apartment has VERY hard water. (I tested it). The apt manager blames the city and claims they can't add water softener. Almost immediately, my hair started to get really limp and stringy.\n\nBecause of that, I started using the Bumble & Bumble Sunday clarifying shampoo once a month. I thought this would help with the buildup I was getting from the hard water. However, I'm now noticing more dandruff and those red patches. I usually only get those if I leave conditioner on my scalp.\n\nThe ingredients for that B&B shampoo are:\n\n>Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ppg-2 Hydroxyethyl Cocamide, Gensing Root Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Sage Leaf Extract, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Tetrasodium Edta, Citric Acid, Chlorophensin, Phenoxyethanol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Green 5, Violet 2, Fragrance.\n\n**Can anyone advise whether this could be a problem with the B&B shampoo?** It has done wonders for my hair otherwise.\n\nEDIT:  The bot told me to include the rest of my routine. I wash with that B&B Sunday Clarifying shampoo 1x a month. Otherwise, the routine is typically: [Not Your Mother's Curl Talk shampoo](https://www.nymbrands.com/product/curl-talk-shampoo/). Then every other time, I use either Not Your Mother's Curl Talk conditioner OR [Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner](https://curls.biz/product/blueberry-bliss-reparative-leave-in-conditioner/) (which I don't leave in). Currently, I diffuse it but don't put any product in it. \n\nMy hair is 2C/3A. Although, the hardwater seems to make it more 2A/B after a while. My hair is very fine, and most products weigh it down.",

    "body": "In the rapidly evolving world of nail care, the Metanail Complex has emerged as a noteworthy product, attracting attention from both professionals and enthusiasts alike. As someone who values the health and appearance of nails, I took it upon myself to thoroughly test the Metanail Complex and document my findings. This review aims to provide an insightful examination of the product's effectiveness, ingredients, and overall usability.\n\n[ Metanail Complex ](https://preview.redd.it/jaoburnkkmcc1.jpg?width=1216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6b154dbd69644c9e7d3b1447e26e81b04e39baf)\n\nDuring my assessment, I paid particular attention to the ease of application, the duration of wear, and the potential benefits that the Metanail Complex claims to offer. I understand that the market is flooded with promises of stronger, healthier nails, which is why I approached this review with a critical eye. My experiences with various nail treatments have taught me what to look for when evaluating such products.\n\nThe Metanail Complex stands out due to its unique formulation, intended to support nail strength and flexibility. I scrutinized the ingredient list, using my background knowledge to discern which components are truly beneficial for nail care versus those that are merely filler. Through this review, I hope to provide a clear and unbiased look at how the Metanail Complex performs under regular use conditions.\n\n## Understanding Metanail Complex\n\nMetanail Complex is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance nail health through its unique blend of natural ingredients and essential nutrients. Its formulation is aimed at promoting stronger, healthier nails while addressing common issues like brittleness and damage. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6vccx6skmcc1.jpg?width=1216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=786b487638d6c2c50fa3e2f097deb2741d660f44\n\n### Composition and Ingredients\n\n**Metanail Complex** includes a blend of vitamins such as **Vitamin C** and **Vitamin E**, which are crucial for collagen production and antioxidant support, respectively. The presence of **organic green tea**, **jojoba seed oil**, **aloe vera**, **lemon peel extract**, and **horsetail extract** contributes to its antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. These organic ingredients support nail texture and hydration while fostering healthier nails.\n\n* **Natural Ingredients**: A host of vitamins, nutrients, and organic extracts\n* **Focus on Nail Health**: Targeting brittleness, dryness, and damage\n* **Antifungal and Antibacterial**: To maintain nail purity and prevent infections\n\n### Benefits for Nail Health\n\nI find that regular application of Metanail Complex significantly improves blood circulation to the nail beds, which is vital for nail growth and health. It also aids in the hydration of the cuticles, reducing dryness and brittleness. By supplying essential nutrients, the product promotes the strengthening of brittle nails and supports the overall texture and health of both the nails and cuticles.\n\n* **Hydration**: Essential oils and extracts for optimal nail and cuticle moisture\n* **Nutrients**: Vitamins and minerals to support nail strength and health\n* **Blood Circulation**: Enhanced circulation for better nutrient distribution\n\n### Application and Usage\n\nApplying Metanail Complex is simple. The serum or capsule can be used as part of a daily nail care routine, ideally after cleaning the nails and cuticles. For best results, it should be massaged gently onto the nails and surrounding skin to ensure proper absorption. Foot care is also a crucial aspect, and a similar application can be made to toenails if required.\n\n* **Serum/Capsule**: Convenient forms of the product for ease of use\n* **Daily Routine**: Best applied consistently for optimal results\n* **Massage**: Encourages absorption and increases blood flow\n\n### Side Effects and Precautions\n\nAlthough Metanail Complex is formulated with natural ingredients, individuals with sensitive skin should perform a patch test before regular use. Any adverse reactions should be noted, and use should be discontinued if inflammation or discomfort occurs. Overall, the product is well-tolerated by most users.\n\n* **Patch Test**: Recommended for those with sensitive skin\n* **Monitor Reactions**: To ensure compatibility and prevent adverse effects\n* **Discontinue if Necessary**: If side effects occur, stop usage immediately\n\n### Purchasing and Guarantees\n\nMetanail Complex can be purchased directly from the official website, ensuring GMP and FDA-approved manufacturing standards. It is made in the USA and comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which speaks to the confidence in its efficacy and the brand's commitment to customer satisfaction. The product combines affordability with a robust satisfaction guarantee.\n\n* **Official Website**: Purchase directly for product authenticity and guarantees\n* **60-Day Money-Back Guarantee**: A testament to its promised results\n* **FDA-Approved and GMP**: Ensuring high standards in production\n\n## Addressing Specific Nail Concerns\n\n📷\n\nIn my assessment of Metanail Complex, focusing on the specific nail issues is crucial. The product's ability to combat infection, heal damage, and provide nutritional support is underscored by customer experiences. Let's examine how Metanail targets these areas.\n\n### Combatting Nail Infections\n\n**Fungal Infections:** Metanail Complex offers a 20-in-1 formula with antifungal properties tailored to address toenail fungus. Notably, plant extracts such as gotu kola and witch hazel serve as antimicrobial and antifungal agents, working directly on various fungi causing nail infections. These ingredients not only alleviate symptoms such as *discoloration*, *itching*, and *pain* but also tackle the root cause of nail fungus.\n\n**Hydration and Circulation:** Ingredients like glycerin are integral in maintaining hydration, which is pivotal for healthier nails and mitigating brittleness or breakage. Improved circulation, another aspect of nail health, is enhanced by compounds that support skin health adjacent to the nail bed.\n\n# Restorative Treatments for Damaged Nails\n\n**Enhancing Collagen Production:** Collagen is vital for restoring the strength of nails, which the Metanail Complex aids through specific nutrients that trigger the body’s natural collagen production. Damaged nails benefit from this reinforcement, which improves both the appearance and integrity of the nail structure.\n\n**Replenishing Nutrients:** The product's content of sage leaf extract and other nourishing compounds offers nourishment, essential for health of nails that have suffered from damage due to chemicals or harsh environmental factors.\n\n### Nutrition and Dietary Support\n\n**Vitamins and Minerals:** Metanail Complex espouses a comprehensive approach with a spectrum of vitamins such as vitamins C and E, along with minerals. These are fundamental for both the health of nails and the skin surrounding them, contributing to their thickness and preventing breakage.\n\n* **Supplements:** For systemic support, the inclusion of MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane) in the complex aids in building keratin for nail health, while the dietary supplements ensure a steady supply of essential nutrients.\n\n### Customer Feedback and Reviews\n\n* **User Testimonials:** Direct feedback from users like Rachel M. and Michael O. suggests the effectiveness of Metanail Complex. Their experiences highlight significant improvements in their nail conditions.  \n\n\n[User Feedback Summary](https://preview.redd.it/lrblwj4fkmcc1.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f22dd1884a079ac4ba7f5523550bdb34ef707fb)\n\nOrganic infusions and a dedication to the absence of harsh chemicals position Metanail as a restorative option that aims for efficacy without compromising the natural state of the nail and skin. This commitment to nail health through holistic means is echoed in many reviews which praise the serum's restorative capabilities.",

I came across Clayge treatment that appeared to have fewer oils in it but I still don't know what it really is because my Japanese is so bad. The only English info I could find on the internet was the company's warning not to use it if you have eczema. I don't know if Sebderm counts. \n\nI usually use a shampoo bar my mom makes every other day or so with a scalp brush and would like to work a conditioner into the routine. \nDoes anyone have experience with this product or something similar?\nHow should a treatment be used?

By nourishing skin cells and reducing pore size, it can provide users with a smoother, more youthful-looking complexion. With consistent use, the product may even help to repair skin damage and reduce the effects of sunburn. Notably, users are likely to observe significant improvements in skin texture and a reduction in the appearance of dark spots. \n\n# About Revisil\n\nThis cream is designed to revitalize skin cells, combat signs of aging such as fine lines and dark spots, and promote a more youthful appearance. It has been carefully formulated using thoroughly researched ingredients. To use, simply apply a small amount to freshly cleansed skin each night before going to bed, making sure to cover the entire face and neck area evenly. With consistent use over a few weeks, users are likely to observe significant visible improvements to the skin.\n\n[(Promo Offer) Visit The Official Revisil Website Here To Order And Get An Amazing Discount Online Today](https://mwebaction.com/7626/1250/2/?)!\n\n# Revisil Ingredients\n\n The Revisil formulation, which is made up entirely of organic ingredients, includes a variety of key components. Some of these are highlighted below:\n\n**Okinawan Fenugreek**: This ingredient, which is traditionally used in a variety of products due to its anti-aging properties, is native to Okinawa, a Japanese island. It works to hydrate, rejuvenate, and firm the skin, and is a rich source of natural anti-aging ingredients that help to improve skin texture.\n\n**Retinol**: One of the most potent ingredients in the mixture, retinol - also known as vitamin A - is often referred to as the \"Holy Grail\" of anti-aging. It helps to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and also works to shrink large open pores, leaving the skin with a smooth finish.\n\n**Safflower Seed Oil**: This type of oil contains thymoquinone, a natural antioxidant that fights free radicals to reduce inflammation and keep the skin hydrated.\n\n**Vitamin E and C**: The formula includes a beneficial amount of these two vitamins, as they are some of the most effective natural antioxidants and help to reduce inflammation.\n\n**Vitamin D**: This vitamin, which the body naturally produces when the skin is exposed to sunlight, is essential for promoting anti-aging effects, hormone production, and boosting immunity.\n\n**Potassium**: Also found on the Japanese island of Okinawa, potassium is considered a natural moisturizer for the skin. It helps to rejuvenate cells and provides a youthful glow, as well as protection against external damage to the skin.\n\n**Shea Butter**: This antioxidant-rich ingredient is used as the base of the formula. Its linoleic acid content moisturizes and protects the skin from free radical damage, while its high concentration of oleic fatty acids helps to boost the skin's protective barrier. Additionally, it has been shown to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Tilia Cordata Flower Extract**: In addition to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, this extract is known for its skin-conditioning benefits. Its unique scent and calming effect make it a popular choice in skincare products. It can also help to repair free-radical-induced damage and protect against future damage.\n\n**Sage leaf extract:**  This natural ingredient is utilized in oils, ointments, and creams to decrease the likelihood of eczema and psoriasis while enhancing the state of skin prone to acne.\n\n# Benefits of Revisil\n\n[Revisil can rejuvenate the skin and improve its health in just a few weeks of use](https://mwebaction.com/7626/1250/2/?), without any potentially irritating chemicals as it is made entirely of natural ingredients. \n\nIt is highly effective in treating skin damage, especially on the outer layer, and penetrates deep into the skin's cells to revitalize them. \n\nThis product can even erase signs of aging and acne scars, giving the skin a youthful and radiant appearance. It has been shown to reduce the visible effects of aging, making users look up to 15 years younger. Additionally, Revisil can restore suppleness to the skin and promote the healing of environmental damage.\n\n# Why choose Revisil?\n\nMany individuals are unaware that their personality and self-esteem undergo changes as they age, but those who recognize this phenomenon strive to address the symptoms through natural means. While waiting, one can continue to inquire about the product or business. For example, is it a sound investment? Are there any long-term effects associated with it? How critical is it to adhere to strict skincare standards? Is there a specific diet that should be followed in conjunction with Revisil treatment?\n\nRevisil's marketing materials proudly declare that it is made without artificial ingredients and has not been linked to any negative side effects. Its gentle formula makes it safe to use on the face without fear of irritation, and it does not require any special attention or dietary restrictions. However, with regular use, users will notice a remarkable improvement in their skin's texture and the reduction of fine lines. This treatment is successful because it activates a protein in the body called telomerase. When applied to the skin, it acts as a barrier to protect the underlying cells from damage. In other words, it stimulates natural cell regeneration, which results in a youthful and healthy appearance.\n\n# What are the best ways to bring back a youthful glow?\n\nThere is a wide variety of formulas available in the market, each boasting its ability to make the skin appear younger, eliminate wrinkles, and firm up the skin. Nevertheless, customers may be unaware of the possible adverse effects of these creams and serums. What may seem like a radiant complexion could potentially lead to skin cancer or other health concerns in the future.\n\nIt is important for potential buyers to prioritize seeking out solutions that offer long-term benefits without compromising their values. Although they may not notice immediate results, consistent use will result in a healthy and radiant appearance for their skin. Revisil stands out as a safe and effective anti-aging solution, as it exclusively employs natural ingredients.\n\n# Revisil Purchase & Price\n\n[The only available option for purchasing Revisil may be through the company's official website](https://mwebaction.com/7626/1250/2/?).\n\nFor those interested in buying the formula in large quantities, here are the packages that are available to choose from: \n\n* Buy 1 bottle of Revisil at $69 with a small shipping fee\n* Buy 3 bottles of Revisil at $177 with free shipping\n* Buy 6 bottles of Revisil at $294 with free shipping\n\n# Refund Policy\n\nRevisil has made a significant impact in the realm of natural remedies, serving as a game-changer.

    "body": "I was recently sent a complementary jar of the the Guerisson 9-Complex Horse Oil Cream. I applied to sample this product in exchange for my honest review on my Instagram account. When I first applied to sample the cream I recognized the packaging but I did not know much about the cream itself.\nWhen I opened the box I was surprised to see a full size jar (2.47 oz) of the Guerisson 9-Complex Cream with Horse Oil as well as some bonus items; two Dermal Korea Sheet Mask in Vegetable Placenta and Wine and two foil packets of The Starry Night Pack. I LOVE Dermal Korea sheet masks and have never heard of the night pack. \n\nAfter unpacking the box contents I did a few searches regarding the ingredients and authenticity of the product (I did, indeed, receive an authentic jar. Apparently it's a huge issue). I pulled the following ingredient list from CosDNA:\nPurified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Horse Fat, Shea Butter, Niacinamide, Stearyl Olivate, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Beeswax, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Polycryloyldimethyl Taurate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Mentha Suaveolens Leaf Extract, Sage Leaf Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Lavender Flower Extract, Rose Flower Extract, Lemon Balm Leaf Extract, Chamomile Leaf Extract, Bergamot Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Betaine, Carbomer, Polysorbate-20, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, Titanium Dioxide, Glyceryl Caprylate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hydrated Silica, Disodium Steryl Sulfosuccinamate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Fragrance, Tocopheryl Acetate, Jojoba Seed Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Green Tea Extract, Ligularia Fishceria Leaf Extract, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Soybean Oil, Human Oligopeptide-1, Lecithin, Astaxanthin, Myristyl Alcohol, Xanthum Gum, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Octyldodecanol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceramide NP. \n\nAs you can see this product does contain horse fat, which is usually obtained as a by-product of the meat industry.\nThe Guerisson 9-Complex comes in a heavy, glass jar with a lovely embossed metal lid and a clear plastic spatula for scooping out the product. The cream itself is very thick and occlusive in the jar but melts on skin contact, spreading smoothly, and absorbing quickly. The amount I used in the picture below was more than enough for my entire face and neck, so a little does indeed go a long way. I have since reduced my usage to about half that amount for my face and neck.\n\nThe scent is subtle but fruity; it reminds me of grapefruits and lemons. I absolutely adore grapefruit so the fragrance is a huge win in my opinion. This cream keeps my skin hydrated all day without leaving it feel greasy or heavy, and I use it under a CC Cream with SPF.\n\nThe Guerisson 9-Complex has worked pretty great for me so far, I feet like the problem areas I have (a line between my eyebrows, a frown wrinkle on my right side) have been less visible (which should be an indicator the skin is more plump and hydrated). If it weren't for the horse oil I would purchase this product; however I can not personally continue to use this comfortably for ethical reasons. If you have no problem with using a cream with animal products I would highly recommend trying out the Guerisson 9-Complex Cream.",

Metanail serum pro is formulated with a blend of natural ingredients. It is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving no oily residue or stickiness. It is a non-toxic product that can be the ideal nail-saving serum. Not only does it save your nails from fungal infections and other problems, but is designed to offer long-lasting results and beautiful hands and feet. \n\nIt is a 20 in 1 topical formula consisting of all-natural ingredients that are backed by scientific research to help maintain and improve nail health. Moreover, it is manufactured in an FDA-approved facility while following all good manufacturing practices so that’s another plus point. It also has many positive customer reviews.\n\n**What is the Working Process of Metanail Pro Serum?**\n\nMetaNail Serum Pro, a unique nail care complex, helps you eliminate harmful nail fungi such as T. rubrum. The United States is home to a large population of people with this fungus. T. rubrum causes the majority of serious health problems. This fungus, if not treated in time, can damage vital organs such as the heart and lungs. It can even cause damage to toes and bones in some cases. MetaNail Serum Pro effectively removes T.rubrum and its associated issues.\n\nThis serum is formulated to provide the nutrients necessary for healthy and robust nails. It contains vitamins and minerals such as zinc and calcium. Serum ensures that keratin is produced in a healthy manner. Keratin, the protein that hardens hair and nails is important for your health. The body produces keratin naturally, but sometimes production can slow down. Metanail Serum Pro USA increases keratin.\n\n[**Visit the official website for more information on Metanail Serum Pro.!**](https://metanail.promancorp.com/)\n\n**Metanail Serum Pro Ingredients :**\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the right product, it is important to consider the ingredients used in it. The ingredients help you understand the quality of the product and whether the product is the right fit for you or not. Unlike conventional nail growth serums, Metanail Serum Pro is formulated with natural and strong ingredients that can help your nails get the strength and growth they had and are nourished without any side effects. The ingredients present in Metanail are: \n\n**Glycerin**\n\nGlycerin, also known as glycerol is a commonly used ingredient in skincare and cosmetic products. It is a colorless, odorless, and viscous liquid that can help to keep moisture on the skin and nails. It is an excellent remedy for people who have dehydrated skin as it has properties that create a barrier around the skin. This traps moisture allowing your skin to absorb it completely, keeping your skin fresh, hydrated, and soft. \n\n**Vitamin E and Vitamin C**\n\nThese two essential vitamins are used mainly in cosmetic and skin care products like serums and moisturizers. These vitamins, when used together give a synergistic effect. When combined, these vitamins provide anti-aging and protective benefits to the skin. Additionally, they are essential for the production of collagen which is the building block of fingernails. Collagen gives the nails shape, strength, and integrity. \n\n**Lemon peel extract**\n\nIt is a versatile and natural ingredient that is derived from the outer layer of lemon fruit. It is beneficial for skin and nails and is loaded with essential vitamins, antioxidants, and other important compounds. It is used as a remedy for discoloration on nails as it can help remove stains and brighten the look of a nail and make them healthier. It is also rich in oils and humectants that can keep the skin hydrated keeping it soft and safe. \n\n**Aloe Vera gel extract**\n\nAloe Vera gel extract comes from the Aloe Vera plant and is known for its numerous health benefits and skincare benefits. It is a popular element of skin care products in the modern world as it has been used as a traditional medicine for many years. Aloe Vera contains amino acids, which are essential in the formation of keratin, a protein that makes up the nails. The use of Aloe Vera on nails can help strengthen them, making them less prone to breaking and splitting. Much like the lemon peel extract, it is loaded with a protein known as 14kDa, which bears powerful nail rejuvenating properties. Additionally, Aloe Vera has antifungal properties that can prevent nail fungus and take care of cuticles.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**\n\nIt is a naturally occurring acid in the body. Hyaluronic acid has become popular as an ingredient in skincare products for its numerous benefits. It prevents the drying and cracking of nails while also strengthening them by promoting the production of collagen. It also moisturizes and nourishes the cuticle all while promoting the health of the nail bed and increasing blood flow and promoting the growth of healthy cells. \n\n**MSM**\n\nMSM is a naturally occurring compound and is used as an ingredient in many skin and nail care products. It has helped promote the growth of healthy and strong nails by increasing and improving the production of keratin. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation and promote healing in nails. Moreover, it takes care of the cuticles and improves the appearance of discolored or yellow nails making them look brighter and cleaner. \n\n**Jojoba seed oil extract**\n\nDerived from the seeds of the jojoba plant, jojoba seed oil extract is very beneficial for nail health. Not only does it moisturize the skin and leave it soft but it also helps calm and soothe irritated skin and nails. It promotes healthy nail growth and is uniquely effective when it comes to long-term nail and foot comfort. \n\n**Sage leaf extract**\n\nDerived from the leaves of the sage plant, sage leaf extract works almost the same as jojoba seed oil extract. It has anti-inflammatory properties and promotes healthy and strong nail growth.  \n\n**Organic green tea and hops**\n\nGreen tea contains numerous beneficial compounds such as antioxidants which can help promote healthy skin and nails. \n\n**Rosemary and pelargonium graveolens**\n\nBoth are organic botanical plants that have been traditionally used in skincare. Rosemary is an organic herb that contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Pelargonium graveolens is a plant that has a sweet floral scent and is known for its balancing effect on the skin. It is used in Metanail Serum Pro because it is known to strengthen nails and promote healthy growth.\n\n**Gotu Kola**\n\nGotu Kola is a herb that has been traditionally used for its healing and rejuvenating properties. It improves circulation and boosts the production of collagen, providing strength and structure to nails and preventing brittleness and breakage. \n\n**Witch hazel, Scott pine, and horsetail extract**\n\nWitch hazel, Scott pine, and horsetail extract are natural plant extracts that are very beneficial for skin and nail care. All three are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Horsetail is rich in silica, a mineral that is important for strong nails and healthy skin.

As someone who deals with stress-induced anxiety and sweat, I've been in search of a reliable solution for years. What sets Carpe apart is their 3-step regimen that allows for personal modifications. I found the solid stick too strong for my skin, so I've adapted by only using it in the morning, followed by the exfoliating wash at night. The treatment pads were too aggressive and caused irritation, so I've switched to a moisturizer instead. Despite these changes, the Clinical Grade Underarm Antiperspirant Wipe remains effective in preventing sweat.\n\nThe product's gentle approach suits sensitive skin like mine well, and I appreciate the variety of scents available.

As someone who doesn't like being limited by gender, I appreciated this feature. But what really stood out to me was the fact that it's paraben-free. After reading so many articles about the potential negative effects of parabens, it was refreshing to find a product that didn't contain them.\n\nThis lotion felt so gentle on my skin, and the scent was pleasant without being overpowering. It was easy to apply, and I liked that it was non-greasy. The most impressive thing, though, was how effective it was in reducing sweat. I started using it daily and was amazed at the difference it made. Not only did my feet feel fresh all day long, but I also noticed a significant decrease in the odor.\n\nWhile the price might be a bit higher than some other antiperspirant foot lotions, I believe it's worth it for the comfort and confidence I've gained. And after reading all these positive reviews, it's clear that I'm not the only one who thinks highly of Carpe Antiperspirant Foot Lotion.\n\n### [Long-Lasting Coconut Vanilla Carpe Deodorant with Dermatologist-Approved Formula](https://serp.ly/amazon/Carpe+Deodorant&utm_term=long-lasting-coconut-vanilla-carpe-deodorant-with-dermatologist-approved-formula)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eoeuedypnjjd1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b29615c38feb421d9ecb64d1fa3d3f24c7a02cf\n\nCarpe's Clinical Strength Underarm Antiperspirant with Deodorant is the real deal: a dermatologist-recommended, gentle-on-skin, long-lasting sweat- and odor-blocker. I've been using it, and it's a game-changer. The stuff really works.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this antiperspirant is that it's gentle. After heavy gym sessions, it used to leave white residue on my clothes and sometimes irritate my skin. This product is different - no white marks, no sticky feeling. I appreciate the attention to detail they've put into it.\n\nAnother highlight is the scent, which I think is perfect. It's subtle, just enough for you (and others! ) to appreciate. It's not too overpowering, which is a bonus when you're in close quarters with other people.\n\nThere are a few minor drawbacks though. The application process can be a bit tricky as it takes some time to fully absorb and dry. I tend to apply it right after showering, so it doesn't leave any marks on my clothes. It's just something to be aware of if you're in a rush.\n\nAlso, I've noticed that I need to reapply it occasionally throughout the day, depending on the level of my activity. But given the effectiveness of its sweat-stopping ability, this is a small price to pay.\n\nOverall, Carpe's Clinical Strength Underarm Antiperspirant with Deodorant is a product that I highly recommend. It's gentle, effective, and smells delightful.\n\n### [Carpe 3-Pack Deodorant with Free Wipes](https://serp.ly/amazon/Carpe+Deodorant&utm_term=carpe-3-pack-deodorant-with-free-wipes)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggw9cggqnjjd1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=171bfdf3e5d2f316c195eda33246c9e873ecc1f4\n\nDelve into the world of Carpe Underarm Antiperspirant, a meticulously crafted product designed to combat intense sweating and body odor attributed to hyperhidrosis.

That's why I'm most skeptical about this product, even though it's the cheapest and has the most ingredients – though that doesn't necessarily mean anything. But since all the other products in the shop, like dermarollers, etc., are outrageously overpriced, I would be surprised if this particular product was actually worth its price. On the other hand, the other manufacturers are probably making huge margins on their products as well, that's for sure.",

But how does this plant-based serum work, and does it have any visible benefits? Read on to learn more about what Hydrossential Serum oil can do for the health of your skin.\n\n[Hydrossential](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrossential2023) is a serum especially crafted for women to help them maintain flawless skin. This revolutionary formula will transform your skin and help you feel confident again. \n\nNowadays, many toxins and pollutants in the surroundings damage the outer layers of the skin and cause loss of collagen. \n\n[Hydrossential](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F23f6f4n3hugu9n79c6ulwlof22.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3Dredd&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1a7G20XkUO6hvGlJHET8Sc) increases the collagen and elastin production necessary to achieve glowing and beautiful skin.\n\nThis serum also gets rid of wrinkles and fine lines. The age factor also plays an important role in changes that occur to the skin over time. \n\nThus, pollutants from the surroundings and the individual's age play an important role in determining skin quality. \n\nWrinkles, fine lines, discoloration of the skin, dark spots, and many other problems start to appear as we age. Hence, the Hydrossential serum works by eliminating these problems.\n\nHydrossential was crafted using ingredients in the right quantity to ensure that their properties remain intact. The serum is a game changer for women who face skin problems due to aging or other factors.\n\nThis natural and powerful formula illuminates the skin and helps it achieve a natural glow. Each serum bottle contains 30ML and lasts for at least 30 days. All you have to do is apply the product to clean skin, emphasizing the most affected areas. \n\nThis product is meant for external use only and can be used at any time of the day suitable for you.\n\n[**Get Hydrossential at the LOWEST Price Online While Supplies Last**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F23f6f4n3hugu9n79c6ulwlof22.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3Dredd&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1a7G20XkUO6hvGlJHET8Sc)\n\n## How Does Hydrossential Serum Oil Work?\n\nThe team behind the Hydrossential Serum oil has worked for many years on the blend and is now eager to ensure that its users will benefit from all it has to offer. Extensive studies and trials have assured it can deliver on its promises and that users can enjoy smooth, radiant, and blemish-free skin.\n\nWhile you may have already seen its benefits from the numerous commercials being aired online, we think it’s a good idea to tell you about ways in which this oil can help you. Understanding how it works and [what to expect from the Hydrossential Serum Oil](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F23f6f4n3hugu9n79c6ulwlof22.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3Dredd&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1a7G20XkUO6hvGlJHET8Sc), and why you can’t afford to ignore it.\n\nFirstly, the Hydrossential Serum Oil makes it easier for your skin to absorb all the nutrients, ensuring your skin gets all the food it needs to become radiant. Most oils will contain the necessary nutrients to make it glow, but the skin will not absorb them, leading to wastage. The team behind this oil ensures that the body can absorb all the nutrients used in the formula.\n\nSecondly, the serum ensures that your skin surface will stay hydrated and moisturized all day long. [Skin damage](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F23f6f4n3hugu9n79c6ulwlof22.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3Dredd&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1a7G20XkUO6hvGlJHET8Sc) often begins to occur when the skin becomes parched and lacks sufficient moisture content. Lack of proper hydration will cause it to become dry, and cracked, appear wrinkly, making you look older than your actual age.\n\nThirdly, not everyone is in a position to give their skin the care it needs or deserves. Daily exposure to harmful environmental pollutants and UV rays from the sun means you have to provide it with extra care. If you aren’t in a position to do so, this serum will come to your aid and ensure that you don’t experience any additional damage.\n\nHydrossential Serum Oil will work towards reversing these damages, and you will soon start to notice a change in the appearance of scars and uneven skin tones.

        "body": "Tea Tree oil, Sweet Almond oil and Vitamin E will all help your beard. There is a lot going on in that ingredient list. A bit of research on the webz would explain most of them and what the benefits are though. Once i get to stuff I can't pronounce I stop reading and put it back. www.mrbeards.com has some products that are awesome. They cost more than $4 but you can pronounce everything on the label and they smell fantastic.",
