He is lying sleeping next to me as I'm typing this.\n\nIt's a thing between me and my boyfriend to point at large phallic things and go \"babe,sit on it\" or to poke your finger at the others butt (when the other has underwear on were not that weird) \n\nToday I took a bath and right after I inspected my face in the bedrooms mirror for pimples. I treat them with tea tree oil, which I drop onto said cotton swabs. \n\nHere's were I fucked up. He was lying on the bed naked. Bottom up. I was treating my face with the oil and he was being sassy with me so I went to him and stuck the cotton swab in his ass. At first he was laughing. That didn't last long. His eyes got wide and he yells \"my ass is on fire\" while running to the bathroom. He tried getting the oil off with a wet cloth but to no avail. \n\nTLDR: I lit the beacons in my boyfriends ass by sticking a cotton swab with tea tree oil on it in his ass.\n\nEdit : thanks for the silver, kind stranger\n\nSecond Edit : thanks for the gold, kind stranger",

Olive oil works well for chemical burn type things (not open wounds).\n\nSource: My stupidity resulting in calling poison control way too many times.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks reddit,  my top comment is now about my dependence on poison control to not kill myself and which oils to stick up your butt. \n\n\nThere are too many comments to respond to individually. Yes, coconuts have a helpful purpose and thanks for the awe full memories. \n\n\nMotor oil enemas are probably not a hot idea. But I haven’t asked poison control that. Someone else feel free to call and ask how to remedy that one. \n\n\nUsing essential oils “neat” is not good for you. Use carrier oils as discussed. \n\n\nAnd yes, using olive oil (other COOKING oils) works well for when you cut spicy peppers to get rid of the burn from capsaicin.... capsaicin is also what is in Icy Hot so same thing works if you happen to get some of that in ummm sensitive areas. \n\n\nAnd sadly none of my fuck ups are really story worthy. Just late nights in college mixed with being accident prone. And after my pup and I had ghiardia (And she almost died) thinking that no amount of bleach would be strong enough to make me feel like my house was clean and safe enough.

I poked him (apparently right over his butthole) to get him to move. There must have been a shocking amount of chemistry between us. I have never seen a non athlete leap that far from a flat footed position like that. He literally leaped over a queen size bed. He whipped around and was like, WHY DID YOU SHOCK MY BUTTHOLE? I was in shock. Which quickly devolved into sobbing laughter. I couldn't stop laughing. For two hours I laughed when I looked at him. For weeks after I laughed when I thought about it. We are still together. He reminds me from time to time of the day I shocked his butthole. He also swears he had butt muscle spasms for a day or two after that.",

    "body": "Ok, so I’m the coworker that encouraged him to post this, unfortunately your account has to be 7days old to post here, so I gifted him an alt i made for a joke about a month ago. \n\n\n\nThis story is about 12 years old. I told it to one of my coworkers yesterday and he said i should share it to Reddit, today he again nudged me so here we are having drinks before the 4 day weekend and my writing is complete. So first time here and hi y’all. Sorry if there are typos! I included a TLDR at the end. \n\nIn college, I met the woman who I thought was my one. We dated for about 2 years and had a big ass wedding after a 10 month engagement, her family was pretty well to do in a small southern town. We were both continuing our educations and I was also working to support us. I was pursuing a masters in engineering while she was finishing her doctorate in anthropology. \n\nOver the summer an opportunity came up for her to make some extra money going as an aid on a religious studies trip to Jamaica. I didn’t hesitate when she asked me about it, I mean, she was going to get to visit Jamaica and get paid for it, I saw no downside other than missing her being at home for 6 weeks. \n\nLittle did I know at the time, but she had been fucking the professor(he had hung out with us, smoked my weed and drank my fucking beer I considered him a friend) who arranged the trip for a couple months and it was a get away for them to bang all over the island. I, clueless and happy went about the weeks while she was gone taking extra shifts so I could match what she made in our account and surprise her. What a dipshit, right? \n\nOne of the students from the trip actually seeked me out to clue me in. I didn’t believe him until I started looking for evidence on my own. I broke down and checked her texts while she was sleeping and nothing was there. There were a few VMs so I decided to listen and there it was, a message from that giant asshole saying how exciting it was that I almost caught them. I opened up her laptop and hit the emails after that, it was piles and piles of shit, making fun of me for not knowing, fucking in our bed and laughing about it. There was so much and I was so heartbroken. \n\nStill too hurt to take any action, I was lost. I had no idea what to do, so I sat on it for a couple weeks and acted as normally as I could, I noticed everything now, I felt SO stupid for not seeing it before. So many signs. One stuck out in particular. \n\nI noticed that our stash of homemade weed lube (if you’ve never tried it, I highly recommend giving it a go) was going down even though we weren’t having sex. It was obvious they were also using the fruits of my labor to get off more effectively. This really pissed me off. Like unreasonably so, Hulk fucking mad. It finally all hit me. I was a goddamn joke to these assholes and they were using the lube I made and fucking in my bed. I didn’t hurt anymore, I just wanted to make them hurt. \n\nSo, while she was “studying at the library” I made a new batch of lube. I put enough weed in it for it to smell like normal, but I also added some poison ivy from our backyard to the mixture, and after refilling the spray bottle we used for application, I waited. \n\nA few days go by and I’m working extra so i can be out of the house more, and bam, bait taken. That night after she goes to sleep my plan goes into action. I sneak her phone away and delete my contact, while replacing his phone number in his contact as mine. I go to bed but can’t sleep because it feels like I’m 5 and tomorrow is Christmas. \n\nDawn arrives and she’s in the shower. I get a text. \n\n*im super itchy are you ok?*\n\nNow Lord, now is my time. \n\n*look, I thought it had cleared up but I guess i had a flare up. I’m sorry, but I’ve got herpes, and I guess you do now too*\n\nI heard this bitch squeak in the shower. I’m covering my mouth damn near losing it. \n\nI went on to tell her that it was time to end things now, a new semester was about to start and I kind of have a little crush on another T/A. I wanted her mad, this is a woman that never got told no growing up, and never had to deal with rejection. Let alone from a balding dude in his 50s with herpes. \n\nWhen she got out of the shower it was obvious she had been crying but i could see the anger in her eyes. I could see how uncomfortable she was squirming at the table drinking coffee and mulling the situation over. Another little nudge is what she needed. The reply she got to her pages and pages of anger and sadness was: “thanks for the good times, but can you keep this a secret between us, I don’t want to ruin my chances with anyone else” she’s flush with anger now, just seething, she gathered her keys and headed out the door without even saying goodbye...\n\nI knew where she was going. \n\nI booted up her laptop and set it to reformat, deleting her dissertation and any notes pertaining to it before following her to campus, I parked a few lots over and rush over to his office where i find her screaming at him for giving her herpes. There’s lots of people there. Professors, aids, students, other faculty. I’m dying. He is beyond embarrassed and confused as fuck, she is ugly crying in front of her peers, I’m in heaven. I didn’t even care that people were going to think I had herpes too. \n\nThe fallout was apocalyptic in their department.\n\nHe lost his job due to code of conduct at the university, we got divorced the following year (state law was we had to be separated for one full year before being granted a divorce) I got to keep most of the assets (primarily savings, and not a ton, but I worked for it). She never finished her doctorate and went on to be a perpetually pregnant housewife that sells herbalife on Facebook and he teaches high school now. It took a few years for it all to unfold, but watching it was glorious. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: wife cheated, so I made her think she had herpes and engineered a social situation for her to out her affair publicly herself.\n\nEdit: a few of you are asking for a recipe for the goodies so here you go: \n\nFollow the directions for use or it’s kind of a waste, and this is totally geared towards the ladies. We’re talking big fucking Os. Use polyurethane condoms! It breaks down latex. \n\nWeed lube:\n\n1/4 ounce flower or 1 gram CO2 extracted live resin (preferred)\n\n4 oz MCT coconut oil \n\n2 16 oz mason jars \n\n3 coffee filters (only if flower is used)\n\n2 drops tea tree oil - it really makes a difference \n\n30 leaves poison ivy*\n\nSmall spray bottles- think perfume. \n\nPut oils and wax or flower in mason jar A and heat in oven for 80 minutes at 240 degrees, turn oven off and allow it to cool for about an hour. Strain through coffee filters if you used flower into the second mason jar and then fill the spray bottles. Here’s the instructions and description my current amazing wife wrote for a friend wanting to try it:\n\nAt first you can feel the warmth building up. Everything feels more intense to the touch. The waiting between application and play time is a wonderful mystery. As time progresses the butterflies in the pit of your stomach become more active, while feeling self awareness as the sensations and sensitivity increase. Walking become part of foreplay, the action causes more friction and heat to build up. As your spouse begins touching at your neck and shoulders the warmth rises up your body sending chills down your spine. Each touch becomes more euphoric than the last until foreplay is done...from there enjoy complete euphoria in your partners embrace. \n\nApplication: 8-10 total sprays. Use 2-3 on your fingers at a time. \nSelf application- spray on fingers and massage around the clitoris and labia down toward your opening working the oil inward towards your g-spot. \n\nTo help with cramps- spray on tampon, insert, go. Without tampon. Get .5 ml in a syringe, insert, spray and stay with hips lifted for 1-2 minutes. \n\nWith spouse- Have your spouse apply the spray to their fingers, gently spreading it over the clitoris, labia, pushing some into your cookie. Think of it like painting, the better the coverage, the better it will feel. Be sure to apply to your G-spot, it’s about 2 inches in on the front wall of your vagina, for an added plus, apply to the O-spot, which is directly across from the G-spot on the back wall of the vagina. Application shouldn’t take more than 3-5 minutes, then don’t even touch it for at LEAST 20 minutes. Spend this time exploring other areas of your lovely treasure. \n\nDon’t use if overly intoxicated, you’ll simply waste it. \n\n*poison ivy optional, not recommended for self use",

    "body": "So, this isn't exactly pointless but I don't know where else to post this, so let me know. \n\nI'm a high school student. I was taking the bus home when, halfway into it, a butterfly got caught in the wind and was thrown into the bus. It landed on my arm. I looked down and realized it was there, so I picked it up and cupped it in my hand. It was only on its back and didn't respond at all. Everyone on the bus was freaking out and they also said it was dead. I held onto it because I didn't feel like it was. I noticed his foot was bent and he couldn't use it. \n\nWhat do you know, 5 minutes later it started to move, very slowly. Everyone freaked out again. I sat there for 10-15 minutes with it on my hand. It even tried to fly once, but it mostly just flopped around on my hand. \n\nPeople were saying to let it out the window, but I didn't want it to get hurt again. I kept it in my hand for the entire time. I carried it to my house. I have butterfly plants in my backyard, so I set it on one of those. \n\nIt fell off of the plant later on because the wind was too strong. I put my hand near it, and it ran towards my hand with no hesitation and started to climb up my arm. I had to push it off onto a plant. \n\nHowever, it kept falling off and it was about to rain, so my mom said to take it inside. I placed a piece of watermelon near it. Now it's chilling near this piece of watermelon. His proboscis is twitching so I hope he's about to eat it. His leg has curled up to his body, so he's walking on 3 legs. I don't think that's a good sign. He is moving freely now though. \n\nI'm not really sure if I'm doing the right thing to help its survival. Help is appreciated. \n\nI'll update this if anyone is interested on if he survives or not. \n\n**Pictures:** https://imgur.com/a/teV5C\n\n**Update:** it looks like his bad leg and proboscis is slowly extending. Hope that's good. \n\n**Update:** he's sort of using his leg now. It's completely out and on the ground but it's like he's not putting any weight on it. Still hasn't had any of the watermelon.\n\n**Update:** Nothing has happened. He's been completely still, so I don't know what to think. ): I'm going to add an apple near him too. \n\n**Update:** I have offered hummingbird juice stuff, a banana, and watermelon but he hasn't had any of it. I just took it away because I didn't want it to attract any bugs towards him. It's getting late so I took him inside. Not sure if that's the right thing to do. Not gonna lie, it's not looking too great guys, he doesn't move at all. He still responds if I move it and whatnot, but otherwise he does nothing. He loves to be on my fingers I guess, because he doesn't want to get off when I pick him up. If I push him then he gets on the hand that I'm pushing him with. \n\n**Update:** For time reference, I found  him around 2:50 and I'm writing this update at 11:50. So...this is what has been going on for the past three hours. I brought him into my room and was going to pick him up to put him near a bottle cap full of sugar water. However, he immediately curled his legs like a dead fly. I started to cry, honestly. It wasn't responsive for a while until it started to shake. I Googled it, turns out he was cold. I picked him up and used my breath to breathe hot air on him. This helped him. I then force fed him the sugar water, though I don't know if he could actually get it because his proboscis was coiled up but this also seemed to help. He started to flutter his wings a tiny bit. He was shaking more. I have spent the past two hours breathing hot air on him and then force feeding him sugar water. Two hours in, I found a heating pad and sat him on that with cloth in between so it's not too hot. I'm not surprised that he most likely won't make it, I knew he had a slim chance of survival since the first time I saw him. He has slowly been becoming less responsive. He is still alive because he is still shaking. I feel like this is all my fault. I will keep him laying on the heating pad and occasionally force feed him. \n\n**More pictures:** https://imgur.com/a/GiPLb\n\nAssuming he's going to die in my care, what should I do? Should I bury him or keep him displayed? I have another butterfly displayed in a glass frame and I was wondering if that would be okay to do the same to him. I don't know how to preserve a butterfly though. \n\n**Update:** It's the next day. He died around midnight last night. I'm not surprised but I am sad. I know no one is probably interested anymore, but I've decided to try to display him. I'll update with how that process is going. Right now, his wings are being held open and kept in Tupperware in the freezer. That's a vague description but yeah. I know there's a good possibility of error since I have no experience displaying butterflies, but I'll try my best. Rest in peace, my butterfly friend ):\n\n**Update:** The kind words have made me very happy. Thank you all so much. Thank you to those that helped me identify him, also thank you to whoever gilded me! I never expected that! It's hard for me to respond to every message now, but I do read every single one of them. I've been getting some suggestions on how to properly display him, but it looks like most people are getting information from how beetles are displayed instead of butterflies. Not saying this is wrong, I don't really know what I'm doing, but I searched specifically how to preserve a butterfly and they all say something along the lines of pinning it open, putting it in the freezer, and so forth. Right now, I have him on Styrofoam in the freezer, inside a Tupperware container. I spread his wings and put baking sheets over them independently, pinning the baking sheet down around his wings (not into the wings). I was told to keep him spread open like this. I'm thinking of keeping him like this until Friday. In the meantime, I'm getting a frame and more Styrofoam. Also, I'm taking a risk, but I was worried about mold growing so I put three drops of tea tree oil on his body (not the wings). If this doesn't work out, then of course I'll just bury him, maybe plant something over him. Let me know any suggestions. \n\n**Pictures-** Him climbing on my arm while I was trying to get him on some flowers: https://gfycat.com/coldminorbinturong\n\nhttps://imgur.com/mlQ6qUa\n\nWhat I'm aiming for the display to look like: https://imgur.com/Ps1rQfa\n\n**Update four-ish days later:** Butterfly is still doing well in the freezer. I got my frame today and I'll be trying to put him in on Monday, since I'll be gone this entire weekend. \n\n**Final Update:** Came back early this weekend so I finished his display today. I like how it turned out: https://imgur.com/a/jGhxc I'm going to a put a quote from someone in the comments, as well as the story and the type of butterfly on the back. I'll also probably include some of my favorite comments and PMs, since I'm glad you all have supported me with this. (I'll also probably go through and make this post a little easier to read and fix typos.) Feel free to still send me any messages no matter how old this post is. Thank you guys (:",

You took care of something that had basically no concept of your existence and what you were doing for it. You even loved it a little and it died. You mourned it and respected it - all over something as little and everyday as a butterfly.\n\nIt all seems so insignificant. But you just learned a lot about yourself - you learned that you are an incredibly thoughtful, kind, empathetic, caring soul. You've learned about compassion and doing the right thing for its own sake and even a bit about loss.\n\nIt was a brief moment in your life and all over a little creature no one else would've even noticed. But you just found a bit of who you are as a person - and especially at your age, that's a big deal. As you get older, this moment will be part of you. And someday you'll look back to meeting a butterfly on a school bus and smile at how something so little could help you follow your path so much. I know from experience.\n\nBest of luck to you OP!

    "body": "Why YSK: Lice are so resistant to treatment and the marketed lice shampoo is usually ineffective with single use. Tea tree oil (TTO) is known for its antibacterial and anti fungal properties and is gentle enough to use topically to fight against these pesky blood suckers. Ingesting TTO is poisonous, only use it topically and avoid getting it into your eyes, nose and mouth. \n\nFirst, you mix TTO in a conditioner of your choosing ( I used a cheap one, doesn't matter what it smells like because the TTO will most likely overpower the smell anyways). Then, you apply the conditioner to your head from root to tip focusing on the nape of your neck and behind your ears,  you want to let it sit on your scalp for a while, after you let it sit, you MUST use a fine tooth comb to remove all nits (lice eggs) and as much lice as you can. I would comb through until you see no more bugs in the comb. Then you rinse it out. In order for this process to be effective, I would say doing this treatment once a day for a few days should eradicate the issue. I also would like to note that using lavender oil in combination with the TTO has proven to also be effective, but I have not personally tried this method.\n\nSource:  \nMy kids had lice for a good month before I was able to finally once and for all get rid of them by using TTO.\nMuch more credible sources than a stranger on the internet: https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-tea-tree-oil/art-20364246\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/tea-tree-oil-treatment-lice#the-research",

    "body": "*Update: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SO MANY LINK SHARES🥹❤️Crossed 300 reshares! And SOOO many upvotes too🥺 maybe I should create some more guides☺️Let me know what you want me to :)*\n\nI'm a Femboy here so...some of this may be extreme but you can look into the particular heading :) I've been shaving my body from last 4-5 years. I'll mention what I follow.\n\nIn my opinion, nothing makes a man more sexy, hot and attractive than him sporting an all natural bush🌳😊! \n\nBut since hygiene may be compromised at times, I feel this can help a lot of the jocks, studs, hunks, dads and men in general on this sub-reddit :'P! And since many of you might feel shy regarding this, I thought of sharing my insights, experience and the way I go for shaving the pubes 😊:-\n\n(Do all this with **warm water.** Cold water would tighten your pores and won't give the comfortable finish)\n\n**Starting with a trimmer** with a clip-on to avoid any skin coming between the trimmer, **set it on around 3-4 scale and cut all long and thick hair possible!** This will help in a faster shave later and may not clog your razor blade! 🪒\n\n**For dicky 🍆:** Get yourself **slightly erected (semi)**! The reason, so that you can get a tighter skin to work on the base of your manhood which will lead to easier and quicker shaving :)! Work your way up near the pubic region first by foaming with shaving cream/gel and lathering 🧼😄 then slowly reach up the shaft and go along the grain. Once you're finished doing this, rinse the area thoroughly!\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**For balls 🍒:** You don't necessarily need to be hard or semi. But you have to make sure that you lather and foam much better and gently! And absolutely **NO USE OF ELECTRIC TRIMMER!** This would be your worst choice and no matter how much clippers you use, your skin on your balls can 90% be snipped between them! Always prefer shaving or at max, using a scissor to gently trim the hair. Then **take smaller segments of the skin on your testicles and gently stretch it and then run the razor to make that area smooth** 🪒😄and then finish off the remaining! And be very gently and calm! My advice would be to go for a **warm shower** rather than a cold one so that your balls are relaxed, loose and hang instead of a tight skin! \n\nKeep rinsing and applying the cream again and again as you will have to see how much is left 😄! Apply an aftershave once you're done with this to prevent any infections in the area :)\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**LEGS 🦵🏻 -** \nFirstly, trim your hair using a electric body trimmer for a faster and easier shaving process. Rinse the hair and apply the shaving gel and create lather. Let it sit on for 30s to make the skin soft and hydrated. **DO NOT go against the grain on your thighs** ! I have done this in the past and it gives so much bumps and itchyness. Follow your natural hair growth and shave in that. Below the knees, you can go against the grain by just sliding the razor from up to down at first then down to up. \n\n---------------------------------\n\n**BUTTOCKS 🍑 -** \nI don't like to use a trimmer to cut any excess hair as the skin over there might get agitated and create bumps later. Shaving procedure remains the same. The way I do it is I **stand in front of mirror and then shave by my instinct and then twist to see if everything's clear** (sounds funny lol because it is🥲😂).\n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**NEAR THE HOLE 🍩-**\nVery sensitive area and you have to go much slowly and not overdo or repeat the strokes. **For this, I usually do this after I finish my shower, I lie on my back and then spread my legs (like missionary position) and get a clear look of the centre and then watch in the mirror as I shave**. Again, a bit hard to do but works well after some practice :)\n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**CHEST AND BELLY🤰🏻 -**\nUse a trimmer on dry skin and trim all your hair well and good till the base. I sometimes prefer this as it gets the job done of smoothening. But if opting for shaving, the process remains the same. But *you may get an itch or redness for 2-3 days after you shave* against the grain. **DON'T** itch it a lot or else it will worsen the skin.\n\n\n**Always moisturize after shaving** the avoid itching, rashes and irritation due to dry skin after!\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**Incase you're someone who fancy a beautiful pubic shape**, you can first **set your trimmer to a 4-5 scale and then trim off all the longer bush and then remove the clip-ons and trim it from the base to your desires shape** :) this *needs to be done prior to shaving the area hence, on a dry skin!* Then repeat the procedure for shaving until you end up with the clean, neat and well shaped pubic artwork 😄🪴!\n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Optional pro-tip** : Your feet are as cute as your body :'D so make sure you prep the toes, nails and soles well. The same moisturiser works! But if you want the **skin to remain soft and supple, grab an ice cube 🧊 and slowly rub it before sleeping to increase circulation and make them pink and soft naturally! The same can be done for your face if you're suffering from acne!** *It works wonders for real* 🦶🏻🧏🏻‍♂️\n\n                             ---------------------------------        \n\n**Clean/change your bedsheet that particular day** as your bedsheet may have dirt or bacteria which might irritate or cause skin to get infected due to open pores after shaving.\n\n                             ---------------------------------\n\n**GOT A CUT WHILE SHAVING🥺😱!?!**\nNo need to panic at all :) We've all been there! I've cut myself a few times and it's mostly either because I wasn't lathered and relaxed the skin enough or it was an area where I am not able to see clearly hence, my instincts go wrong :/ In such a case, **immediately stop shaving that area and just sit or have that area rinsed in cold shower. If you're bleeding, keep washing with cold water until bleeding stops. Finish your shower and gently apply an antiseptic in a cotton ball (ouch😣but it's going to save you😄)! And throw that particular blade and get a new one!** After that, make sure atleast for a day not to irritate or rub the area by anything! Small cuts heal in a day )\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nGet yourself nice and cleansed in the shower but my recommendation would be **not use any bodywash or soap the same day** as these consists of chemicals which may cause irritation to the shaved area. So, I just **use a loofah sponge** and gently, under the warm shower, start swirling it around in circulation motion all over my body. This is called **exfoliation and is important to avoid bumpyness and dry dead skin left on the body** :) it *really* works!\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nAfter the shower, **use a moisturizer with less fragrance and no parabens** preferably (I use **Calosoft and Hymos lotion** as suggested by my dermat). Drop **2-3 drops of Tea Tree Essential Oil** in your moisturiser to avoid any acne/buttne on your skin :) (this can be optional as tea tree oil might be strong for some skin)\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nHope this helps to you all❤️☺️ Any suggestions or questions from other people are most welcome in the comments :'D!",

Cotton particles can get trapped inside the piercing channel, which will make healing incredibly difficult and infection more likely.\n- Downsizing in gauge. This will do NOTHING good for your healing piercing.\n\n**If you're trying to tell me or other professionals off by saying \"but it worked for me!\" or \"my piercer told me this\"; you've been super lucky and your piercer was not a pro. Don't go back to that studio.** APP is a great place to start when picking out your piercer, but it's still no guarantee.\n\nPlease keep in mind you are trying to heal an incredibly deep wound with a foreign object in it that your body desperately wants to push out - essentially, it is an implant. There are no \"casual\" or \"easy\" piercings - even with a \"simple\" earlobe piercing, you are puncturing the skin with something that resembles a scalpel. Use common sense and ask yourself: \"would I use this method on a surgical wound?\". In 10/10 cases the answer will be \"no\".\n\n\\+ if I tell you to send me a message, you're welcome to do so.

        "body": "My friendly rebuttal to the cotton swab comment on this (taken from my post in r/Legitpiercing)\n\nThe Great Q-Tip Moral Panic\n\nI cannot emphasize the phrase “citation needed” more when it comes to people saying cotton fibers are some invisible menace. This idea is even newer than the cult of titanium, and has far less evidence to support it. I am open to any medical literature that you can find that shows cotton swabs to cause problems in wounds. I have scoured the medical literature available to me, and as near as I can tell it doesn’t exist.\n\nIf you have the notion that non-woven gauze leaves fewer fibers behind when it interacts with a piece of jewelry, I want you to know that your idea is wrong. You can test it. I did! Take a piece of jewelry, rub it in a way that intentionally grabs fibers. Give it your best shot. Non-woven gauze is worse than cotton swabs. And even if your test shows some fibers behind with both swabs and gauze, you need to understand that, yet again, this is a new fabricated problem. In general those fibers are not the cause of huge issues.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XXSZnlR\n\nIn addition, these forums tend to put an undo focus on jewelry movement, blaming it for all kinds of problems that it doesn’t cause. But what causes more movement on, let’s say a daith or a rook piercing: a swap or a finger wrapped in gauze? The finger wrapped in gauze is a bull in a China shop compared to swabs. And that is the way people use gauze. \n\nInstead of thinking of things in a piercing context, I want you to consider cotton swabs in a medical context. Talk to your nurse and doctor friends. I assure you, they use cotton swabs. Regularly. You will hear about routine probing of wounds with cotton swabs. My wife is a nurse and part of the “Skin Team” at her hospital. She uses swabs every single day. She inserts them deep into wounds. She has never heard even the slightest suspicion that swabs cause problems amongst her colleagues. That’s because, when studied, cotton swabs seem to help certain wounds heal, with fewer instances of infection, with better cosmetic results, and less pain. The most recent paper you can find in regards to swab usage is, unsurprising to me, a glowing endorsement of their use. https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/cedars-sinai-surgeon-shows-simple-cotton-swab-slashes-post-operative-surgery-site-infections/\n\nWounds that resemble piercings, like pinsites, are often cleaned with swabs in a manner very similar to a piercing. https://youtu.be/ZBBF81nwdtE?t=194\n\nCotton swabs help remove debris, they are hygienic, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and readily available. If you use them and see fibers left behind, feel free to remove those fibers. But you probably won’t see much debris left behind.  I really prefer the tightly wound pre-sterilized swabs that you see in doctor’s offices, but I don’t think they are absolutely necessary. I have seen no evidence to ever support the “cotton swabs cause problems” hypothesis. \n\nOver and over again, you will see cotton swabs used, alone and in conjunction with gauze, in medical procedures that are far more serious than piercings.  Just like titanium, the cotton swab moral panic is new and doesn’t jive with the past four decades of piercing history. The fear of fibers is totally misplaced. Until I see swabs contraindicated on pressure injuries, surgical drains, pin site care, and surgical sites, I’ll continue to use them on piercings.\n\nPressure Injuries: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iw31WwYVbw (deep probing with swabs, as well as measuring depth of wound with swabs)\nSurgical Drain Care: https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/aftercareinformation/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=ug6099\nPin Site Care: https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/Patients-Families/Health-Library/HealthDocNew/External-Fixator-Pin-Care\nPost-Surgical Wound care: https://www.facs.org/media/zr5dimjk/wound_surgical.pdf",

        "body": "I would have to question a few things. \n1 APP is an organization that pierce pay to be in. It doesn't have anything to do with training or shop quality. It doesn't have the power to take away someone license or grant a license. It's just a web site that will tell you who pays to be a member. They have no more authority than the BBB. It's just paid advertisement for piercers. \n\n2 as far as would I do it after a surgery. Most after care from a surgery say clean with soap and water so are you now saying that saline is not what people should use. Since this site seem to promote using nothing but saline. And not sure how you clean you body and done get soap on a piercing.\n\n3 teatree oil. Multiple study have been published about the healing properties. It's anti bacterial. Helps reduce inflimation and irritation. Reduce the swelling on bumps and scar tissue. There isn't enough testing done to say it's better or worse than anything else. But like everything it has to be used properly and following instruction. There is no fact that says it is bad. At best I could be used with saline . But no where is is said that saline is the only thing and even you don't state the use of saline. The APP says saline in there aftercare but no face to back it up. Just a blanket generic statement and they do say soap if recommend by the pierce. So I am really confused , i cant even find a stance on the APP web site about tea tree oil.\n\nAnd if saline is the only answer I notice that is not even  mentioned on your post. Just follow the advice of the pierce who could actually recommend anything.  this post doesn't recommend itb Just a list of don't with out fact and some against what is posted on the APP site. Unless the stance \" you got lucky\" now counts as fact. \n\nBut the most concerning thing I found here is that is really just an ad to get paid to give advice. It's not free It's your job. You make money if people do have problems.  You profit on the need for information . There is no listing of you credential here just that your a piercer. If anyone would want to know what is the right after care they have to pay you for that information. And would you say that asking to be paid to give information about heath and safety really is against what the APP does. That is their mission statement right\n\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nThe Association of Professional Piercers is a California-based, international non-profit organization dedicated to the dissemination of vital health and safety information about body piercing to piercers, health care professionals, legislators, and the general public.\n\n\nSo maybe everyone need to take a hard look at all the times the tell everyone they are wrong for what they are doing. because the facts that they are using do not have anything to back them up. There are no facts to say what is right and wrong and some statements don't even line up with the APP site.\n\nIn closing. Words matter facts matter. This sub in itself is proof that saline isn't working of everyone. And anyone who suggest otherwise gets attacked with statements like yours. No fact . Just a bunch of APP stance and a piercer said. \n\nWell a lot of piercers are giving different advise based on what they see that works. Every person is going to react different to a piercing. The angle is going to be different and the jewelry that can be used if different there is no pretty little box for a pierce to work in because every poke is going to be different so how do you think there is a set box for the aftercare. That means that every bad heal is the piercers fault. If you follow  the after care to the letter still have issues then the piercer failed. Did they adjust the after care no, there is only one healing process,  its the pierces fault.",

My earlobes are tiny so I think the flat backs were trapping moisture and digging into the fold of my ear (my earlobes are THAT small). Couldn’t go to my piercer during quarantine so I bought longer straight barbells with ball backs. Didn’t know the initial jewelry gauge size so got 16g and 20g.

    "body": "Very tired parents here. We were at our wits ends with our 9 month old. Doctors were useless “lol he’ll grow out of it, moisturize and use these steroids for now.” Rebounds after steroids made it worse than before. We were lucky to sleep for 2 hrs each for almost a month straight. \n\nI spent a whole weekend on PubMed doing research. Turns out people with eczema are colonized by staphylococcus aureus instead of good bacteria.  We started treating the baby for staph and taking steps to encourage other bacterias to take hold, including applying topical probiotics. There’s been a few successful trials using strains of bacteria to treat AD, and we had nothing to lose.  \n\nWe got a 98% reduction in symptoms within a week. \n\nI’ll make a detailed post sooner or later, but a shift in treatment philosophy might be useful for some of you guys.\n\nEdit: Wow so much positive response! I’m getting a lot of questions from people asking for brief outlines of what I did, so hopefully this tides you over:\n\n1.  Look up MRSA decolonization procedures and follow them. Get yourself some Hibiclens (chlorhexidine soap) and a topical mupirocin prescription. Don’t use the mupirocin for more than 10 days. Be aware that staph can build resistance to chlorhexidine. Bleach baths can be effective/soothing but do not actually kill bacteria (concentrations are far too low). The exact mechanism behind bleach baths are still unknown. Edit: I found a cool study that actually showed that bleach baths over the long term (a month and longer) actually led to changes in the skin’s microbiome composition. Less staph and more good guys!\n\n2.  Get a good oral probiotic and some topical probiotic sprays (several available on Amazon). Bacillus subtilis and coagulans help kill/inhibit staph. Others help outcompete the staph. We rotate several to maintain a diversity of species. \n\nStreptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus johnsonii, vitreoscilla filiformis, and bifidobacteriums are what you should be looking for to help outcompete staph and help your skin with ceramide production and healing. There has been a very interesting study on roseomonas mucosa but it doesn’t seem to be commonly available. Just because a bacteria hasn’t been studied doesn’t mean you should stay away, just that we simply don’t know. These will not live on skin permanently and fix you long term. Frequent reapplication is needed. \n\nIf you cannot access probiotic sprays, get probiotic capsules with high CFUs (less filler, more active spores) and mix them with hydrogel (currently using McKesson) and apply that topically. Hydrogels seem to be one of the most effective spore carriers that helps the spores to adhere and germinate. Hydrogel also moisturizes. If you need more info on specific probiotics, I answered that somewhere in the comments. Short answer: Garden of Life Skin+ is good but also has lycopene that turns it red. If the red is a problem, you can buy the bacteria strains I listed individually and blend them together.  When I go this route, I just open the capsules and pour out like a quarter of each of them into a few mL’s of hydrogel, mix it up, and apply. \n\n3. Use prebiotics (microbial foods for good bacteria) like GladSkin (arginine is a prodrug for urea; has protein complex that feeds bacteria) and MiteBGone (contains sulfur. It stinks, but it feeds good bacteria and staph doesn’t like it; also contains tea tree oil which is known to inhibit staph). Smart lotion contains both sulfur and hydrocortisone, but we prefer to apply topical steroids infrequently and separately.  Daily hydrocortisone use can thin the skin and has other drawbacks you can look up. \n\n4. Moisturize. Our go to is EpiCeram (prescription only in US; contains lipids the skin needs to repair itself). \n\n5. Other stuff: Amerigel Hydrogel contains oak tannins that fight staph and is an astringent that helps weeping wounds heal and is a great moisturizer. Aloe and coconut are also nice moisturizers that staph does not like.  Edit: As time goes on, the more impressed I am with this Amerigel. It’s being used in long term wound care to prevent staph/MRSA because it doesn’t seem to create resistance. And I’m talking pretty gnarly wounds, like diabetic ulcers on feet. \n\nDon’t just take my word for it! Start googling or searching PubMed for “topical probiotics atopic dermatitis” and the stuff I’ve mentioned. Unfortunately, this is a shotgun approach by a desperate dad, and not a scientific approach. I can’t tell you which of these treatments are the most important/effective. But it’s a shotgun approach that at least has some evidence behind it.  Look for scientific journal articles and reviews. Any other sources like health/beauty sites and mommy blogs should be taken with a grain of salt and further investigated through PubMed. The science is out there!  \n\nEczema is crazy complex, poorly understood, and can have many causes. Just because this worked for us doesn’t mean it will work for you. My infant has had zero negative reactions to anything I’ve listed here, but make sure you research ingredients and spot test before slathering anything on your child or yourself. But I truly hope this helps some folks.\n\nEdit 2/Update: The scope of this project has broadened considerably as I get sucked further down this rabbit hole. \n\nI am currently on a side quest exploring acidification of skin as a therapy. The severity of AD flare ups directly corresponds to ph. The higher the pH, the worse the flare up. \n\nThere have been studies that found that found acidification of skin with polyhydroxyl acids (PHAs) not only prevents AD development, but halts the atopic march in murine models. They simply added PHAs to Cetaphil. Cetaphil is usually ph 7.4; the researchers brought down to ph 2.8. I will be incorporating skin acidification into our routine for our son.  Edit/Update: we’ve also been using AmLactin rapid relief and a lotion (Neostrata) with PHA for a week now and so far so good!  My wife can’t stand the smell of the MiteBGone, so I only use it when she’s away at work. I still want to keep tea tree oil in the rotation, so we add a drop here and there to other treatments.\n\nYes, I’m still working on this paper. The scope keeps getting larger and larger as time goes on and I sift through more and more research papers. Life is crazy rn and it will take some time, but I’ll finish eventually.  I was a molecular neuroscience and biochem nerd in another life, and I never expected to be teaching myself all the pathways involved in atopic dermatitis, yet here we are.\n\nEdit 3 or 4: Over the past 10 days, the importance of acids has been apparent. AmLactin Rapid Relief has become the moisturizer we reach for the most. Very fast redness relief, not a single hint of flaring since we started using it (still using the other stuff throughout the day too).  We cover him head to toe immediately after the shower/bath. Using it in conjunction with the Neutrogena PHA cleanser and the Eczemact Body Wash has been huge for us. Switching to ph balanced cleansers have also allowed us to increase the frequency of bathing. Things are going very, very well over here.\n\nEdit 5 (almost 6 months later): Our son is still clear and free!  We still use the AmLactin and PHA lotion in rotation, but we only moisturize once per day (twice if he takes a bath, which happens every 2-3 days). We haven’t had to use mupirocin or hydrocortisone in months. Every few weeks, we might see that purplish tint to his skin that precedes a flare up. When that happens, we use a dab of Hibiclens and it clears up within a few hours. We are still applying topical probiotics, but only once per day. \n\nThe most recent round of IgE testing has revealed that he is no longer allergic to soy, wheat, or oats. We have incorporated those foods back into his diet with zero problems. He is still allergic to peanuts and diary, but he is now less sensitive to both. He went from level 5 to 3 for peanuts and level 4 to 3 for dairy, 5 being the most allergic. We’re on the right track. It really does seem that we’re reversing the atopic march. \n\nThe amount of love I have received for this post has been unreal. 6 months later, I am *still* getting regular DM’s from patients and parents saying that this has changed their life, with many reporting total relief. I am so glad my combing through the research has helped so many people, I and am truly touched by all your messages. Seriously, it makes my day when I hear from someone who is enjoying a better quality of life. What a great community. \n\n2/19/2024 Edit:  [This NIH-funded study](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/probiotic-markedly-reduces-s-aureus-colonization-phase-2-trial) found that a specific strain of b. subtilis (MB40) resulted in a major reduction (95% in gut, 65% in nostrils) of staph colonization. \n\nThe MB40 is available for a reasonable price from AmeoLife. Some success stories from other anti-staph subreddits have started to trickle in. Personally, we have just incorporated it into our routine. I think this could be HUGE, since our guts and nostrils are reservoirs for reinfection. (Side note: make sure everyone in your house decolonizes together) Will update about after allowing the probiotic to do its thing for a while month. \n\nIn the meantime, we are switching to HU58 b subtilis and megasporebiotic for topical use. Unfortunately, the AmeoLife has other ingredients besides probiotics, so we’re avoiding it for topical use. The megasporebiotic has some other bacillus strains known for skin-colonizing and anti-staph properties. However, I can’t vouch for its safety or efficacy yet. Use at your own risk. \n\n2/21/2024 Edit:  So there have been some pretty promising studies on Vitreoscilla filiformis extract. It’s a prebiotic that’s selective for good bacteria. Looks like a new product line from L’Oreal was released that contains said VF extract. I’m particularly interested in the “La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+” that’s endorsed by the National Eczema Foundation. It should be available online and at major retailers. I’m gonna pick some up. I’ll add that while my son def isn’t having a flair up, this is the worst his skin has looked in months. Winter sucks. ",

Consider bleach baths to help manage skin bacteria.\n2. **Introduce Probiotics**:\n   * Use oral and topical probiotics to restore good bacteria. Look for strains like *Bacillus subtilis*, *Streptococcus thermophilus*, and *Lactobacillus*. Reapply frequently since they don’t stay on the skin long-term.\n3. **Use Prebiotics**:\n   * Apply prebiotics like GladSkin or MiteBGone to feed good bacteria and inhibit staph. Be mindful of ingredients like sulfur and tea tree oil, which staph dislikes.\n4. **Moisturize Regularly**:\n   * Moisturize with products like EpiCeram or AmLactin Rapid Relief. These help repair the skin and reduce redness. Apply after bathing and throughout the day.\n5. **Balance Skin pH**:\n   * Incorporate acidic lotions like AmLactin or polyhydroxyl acids (PHAs) into the routine to maintain a low skin pH and prevent flare-ups.\n6. **Hydrogels**:\n   * Use hydrogels mixed with probiotics if topical sprays aren’t available. Hydrogels help carry probiotics and moisturize the skin.\n7. **Adjust as Needed**:\n   * Monitor and rotate treatments to maintain good bacteria and stop staph from building resistance.

Ive done extensive allergy testing, contact dermatitis testing .. nothing seems to be triggering my eczema allergy wise. I read this post and was inspired to try to treat eczema as staph since staph seemed to be the root cause of my very first severe eczema outbreak. Prior to my MRSA infection, I had manageable eczema on elbows and back of knees - nothing extreme. However, post MRSA infection i now have eczema all over my neck/face + other areas of my body. My facial eczema has lead to depression.. I am desperate to find a solution/managing routine.\n\n  \nI am on week 1 of trying the following skincare routine, inspired by this post and u/NJoose :  \n-Apply **Chlorhexidine Gluconate 4% Solution** (Hibiclens or I use the [CVS brand](https://www.cvs.com/shop/cvs-health-antiseptic-skin-cleanser-prodid-864765?skuId=945584&cgaa=QWxsb3dHb29nbGVUb0FjY2Vzc0NWU1BhZ2Vz&cid=ps_summer_fa&gclid=CjwKCAjw9IayBhBJEiwAVuc3fu5OHk9X62c2zaZilIGr4VOeX7UbZZ4BDMDVSaBGcXX_tC8HzwADQBoCWkcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)) before showering and/or after a workout at a public gym. I pump the solution on to a clean face towel and apply to all outbreak areas (face, neck, body.. all of it). My face eczema seemed to clear up almost immediately after the first application of the Chlorhexidine Gluconate 4% Solution\n\n-Apply steroid cream to active bodily outbreaks (I plan on doing this temporarily while i get the current outbreak under more control).

        "body": "I am mid 50s and maybe ‘just came down with’ likely eczema, and potentially hives that are potentially something else, and digestive issues. It all started happening a year ago. Eczema hit about 5 months ago on my neck and jaw and then my hands. Very painful on my hands. Hurt to touch things. I have been into improving my gut for years but fell off right before 2020. Then I am pretty sure I had Covid in 1/20. (U.S. didn’t even think we had it back then, but I’ve never had that kind of “flu” in my life.)Then I was vaccinated pretty late in the game cuz I had to for work or it’d be a p.i.t.a. for me plus I’m old. So I got vaccinated. Then I got Covid again anyway in 12/22. \n\nMeanwhile, at work, and since 2020 in the U.S. in general, hand sanitizer was happening for me and everyone else probably almost every day. Not sure if two bouts of Covid, or the vaccine I got, or the antibacterials I was using left and right, or all three together caused my eczema/potentially hives/horrible digestive issues I’ve been dealing with for six months, but I’d never had ANY of these things before. \n\nWhy are we not connecting eczema—at least hand eczema—to stripping the good bacteria from our hands? Or the virus stripping it from our gut? (Even tho I never took meds for it, the virus itself could’ve wreaked havoc on my gut microbiome.) \n\nI’d never had any of these three horrible problems before. Stopped using hand sanitizer and antibacterial soaps etc. when I all of a sudden had an aha moment one day. I had been blindly following what I was told, even though I did and do believe the gut and skin microbiomes are so important and am anti meds in general. I can’t even remember the last time I took antibiotics. Anyway, there I was this anti-med, gut microbiome believer not making the connection between all the antibacterial everything and my issues. But when I stopped using them, my eczema gradually dropped off to either unnoticeable levels it had been at my entire life or got 95% under control. The hives thing is tapering down. The diarrhea I had every dang day has gone. I’ve had tests and they can’t find the root of the digestive issues. Coincidence? I don’t know but I’m back to making kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles and not using sanitizer….just like I was doing precovid. So far so good…except the hives/bites thing….two weeks free of those and the jury is still out. \n\nFeel like doctors in the U.S. are very very pharmaceutically-oriented. Research will continue but I think the microbiome is more strongly connected to our health than we have proof of…for now. Time will eventually reveal the connections. \n\nSo glad your baby is doing better. ☺️",

That also includes OBGYN. When I trained, OBGYN was (in)famously known as the specialty that eats its young; for a specialty that brings life in the world, they definitely did their best to suck mine out of me. Who knows, maybe it changed in recent years. Anyway, that’s the setting. \n\nI’m in the Labor unit working night shifts (7pm to 7am). The residents (training doctors) and attendings (practicing doctors, in charge of the team) have made it clear to me that in the hierarchy of importance, I am beneath the trash can, so I’m stuck there for 12 hours avoiding them when they’re stressed and trying to help to the degree I don’t piss anyone off. Lady comes rolling in with two other people, and one of the residents tells me to go see her. \n\nMe: Hi, I’m IsThatReallyButter, the medical student with the Labor and Delivery Unit. Is it okay if I ask you a few questions?\n\nPatient: Just give me a moment. I need to check your aura. \n\nMe: What? (Side note: I pride myself now on having an amazing poker face, in part because of some batshit things I experienced in medical school. This was one of them.)\n\nPatient: Your aura. I detect oranges and yellows. You’re an optimist aren’t you? I need that right now. Come in, come in. \n\nMe: Thank you ma’am.\n\nI was young and innocent and didn’t leave immediately, but my woo woo senses were screaming. I go through my typical questions about her pregnancy and labor so far, then I ask the dangerous question: Do you have a birth plan?\n\nShe pulls out a laminated binder, opens it, and proceeds to walk me through her incredibly long list of requests, including: no lights, no medications for herself or the baby, no epidurals, regular meditation, keep the placenta, oil diffuser, etc. I think at some point the nurses felt pity on me and one came in to check in. Patient aura checked her too (she was purple, which I don’t know what that meant, but she was in). Nurse got pulled into her long explanation of her pink laminated birth bible. \n\nNurse: Ma’am thank you for showing this to us but I think you should discuss this with the doctors because some of your wishes we can do, but some we might not be able to meet depending on how your labor goes. \n\nPatient: Well I paid good money to be here. I pay for ALL of you to be here. You can MAKE it happen. \n\nEventually I talk her into letting me have it to show it to the doctor and we step out the room. Nurse leaves, very ominously saying: She is going to be special. \n\nFor the next few hours, her room turned into a revolving door as the patient proceeds to hire and fire people based on their “auras”. How this lady read them, I have no clue, but she ended up firing 4 nurses, 2 residents, a tech, and the janitor because some of them were “radiating bad energy” and one was “too red”. She absolutely refused to have any discussion about her birth plan or give any leeway with it because it was decided with her spiritual guru. No one wanted to talk to her because she was too woo woo. So clearly I’m stuck going into her sage scented room to appease her whims (including: cleaning her stuff, refilling her oil diffuser, rubbing tea tree oil on weird places, helping her in her yoga positions). \n\nThen the labor pain really kicked in. And suddenly, morphine was okay in her birth plan because it was a “natural remedy”. And the anesthesiologist’s “piercing green aura” was tolerable because he “mellowed into a soft matcha”. Except, when you give too much morphine to a pregnant woman, the baby also gets it too, and the baby’s heart rate was slowing. So I’m stuck telling her she can’t get more morphine. \n\nPatient: Oh thank goodness you’re here. I need more morphine, I’m in so much pain. \n\nMe: Ma’am, I understand you’re in pain. However, we can’t give you any more. Your baby can’t tolerate it. \n\nPatient: The baby? The baby is completely fine! I feel him! It’s me you should be worried about! I’m the one paying to be here. I’m in pain. I need the morphine! \n\nMe: Ma’am, the anesthesiologist can discuss giving you an epidural for pain control. It’ll be safer for both you and the baby and it’ll control your pain. \n\nPatient: You want to put that toxin in my body? Didn’t you read my birth plan? Absolutely not. I need the morphine. Again, I paid to be here. I pay for your salary. I hired you. Remember, I can fire you. You should be listening to me here! \n\nMe (in my 11th hour of being there, she broke me): Ma’am, with all due respect, I’m just the medical student. I don’t get a salary; I actually pay to be here. Even if you fire me, your doctors, including your anesthesia team, is saying you cannot get more morphine because it is a danger to your baby. I’m sure that the anesthesiologists are happy to discuss any other options for your pain control, which includes an option for an epidural. \n\nPatient: FUCK THOSE TOXINS AND FUCK YOU. GET OUT. YOU’RE FIRED TOO. I KNEW YOU WEREN’T A YELLOW. YOU WERE A CHARTREUSE. \n\nSo I got to go home and collapsed happily in bed. \n\nThe next day, I check in and I got the full story from the nurses. Apparently, she cracked and got an epidural. Then she went into active labor and hated it so much she demanded it to “stop”. She underwent general anesthesia for a C-section and delivered her baby. For the rest of the month I was there, all of us had little name tags with our aura colors on it. I was Chartreuse. \n\nTl;dr Aura reading lady fires me over morphine and ends up playing herself.",

That service dried up too.  I only stayed up in the middle of the night once, and it was too help out private OB's with c-sections. My last night on the L&D service (night before Father's Day), I was paired with the resident that was known for being a black cloud. If it could go wrong on her shift, it did. She warned me to be ready for a shit show. I kept telling her we'd be fine. \n\nSomehow that day, we only had one woman in labor on our service. She ended up being highly dramatic, and at about 8pm, she fired the resident (and consequently me). The attending had to come in and deliver the baby (5am). By the time I got up at 6, the attending had already seen all of our patients, written all of the daily notes, and sent both of us home way early. I learned later that the resident went to bed at about 10pm and her pager never went off. It was the first full night of sleep she ever gotten on L&D.

    "body": "**Sunscreens for Sensitive Skin at Low Price Point (with Photos!)**\n\nI usually post over on /r/Tretinoin, but the good people of that subreddit have encouraged me to post my reviews in SCA as well, so here we are! I've had a lot of fun trying new sunscreens this summer in the hunt for The Perfect One. \n\nI've been on retinoids (Differin, Adapalene 0.3%, then Tretinoin 0.025%) since March 2018, and have used SPF 50 every single day. I have desert-dry, sensitive skin with minor rosacea (subtype one) and PIE leftover from acne. \n\nMy selection criteria are as follows:\n\n* Low Price Point (I aimed for under $15 per bottle, with two exceptions)\n\n* Easily Accessible (available via drugstores or major online venues, e.g. Amazon, Dokodemo, Yesstyle, Ebay)\n\n* Marketed for Sensitive Skin (this varies by brand)\n\n* At Least SPF 50 (generally regarded as \"good enough\" for most people, even Tret users)\n\n\n**MY METHOD**\n\nI work from home, so I have the luxury of not worrying about sunscreen or makeup in the morning. I cleanse and moisturize, then wait until later in the day to apply my sunscreen. I treated each sunscreen exactly the same: I measured out a half teaspoon, applied on every inch of my face (up to my hairline, down my neck and décolletage, around the back of my neck, on my ears, lips, and eyelids), then reapplied a little extra to the high points of my face. All of these were applied over my morning moisturizers (FAB ultra repair cream, rosehip oil, sometimes Stratia LG).\n\nI don't want a sunscreen that I need to be fussy with or careful to keep out of my eye area. I want something cosmetically elegant that I can glob on everywhere and have it just work.\n\nMy dog and I go on our hour-long walk around 5pm every day, when it's cooler and the UV index is lower (under 5). We live in a hot, humid climate (American South) with temperatures up to 95 degrees and humidity above 50% almost every day. There's always a chance of rain in the summertime. I don't tend to sweat a lot, but my hair does get uproariously frizzy. \n\nI took each of the outdoor photos at the beginning of our walk, after the sunscreen had set but before it could degrade at all. The indoor photos were taken after we got back home and cooled off a bit for lighting comparison (bathroom lighting). I'm particularly interested in how these sunscreens wear, and whether they hold up to heat, sweat, and other environmental factors. Reapplication is part of life, but I also want a sunscreen that pulls its weight!\n\nIf a sunscreen did not work for me, I traded it over to Team Body Sunscreen or gave it away to a friend. I don't believe in waste, and sunscreen is still useful even if it doesn't agree with my face.\n\n[Group Photo of the Whole Squad Together!](https://imgur.com/a/4yr9RG7)\n\n**THE REVIEWS**\n\n**Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk Blue Bottle, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Nano Zinc Oxide, Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus\n\n* Japanese, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free\n\n* Moisturizing combination liquid sunscreen that contains hydrating ingredients (hyaluronic acid and collagen). It takes a few minutes to dry down and can get a bit messy/drippy, but it’s worth the effort. This sunscreen looks and feels better than any other I’ve tried. I especially like that it cooperates when you apply multiple layers, and it plays nicely when I apply makeup on top. The pink bottle version contains alcohol and brightening ingredients, while the blue one is the better choice for sensitive skin (it's identical to the old gold bottle from 2018). I'm finishing up my tenth bottle and (sadly) do not plan to repurchase. After the streaky UV photos from a couple months ago on SCA, I have some doubts about the protection this product offers, so I'm going to stop using this as my everyday.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/wggel4L)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($14 for 40 mL) or Dokodemo ($13)\n\n\n**Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 50, PPD 19.2/PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Vegan, and Cruelty Free\n\n* Soft, creamy, clay-like mineral/physical sunscreen that dries to a powdery finish. Superpower level of mattifying on oily skin. It is slightly pink-tinted, and provides coverage comparable to a medium foundation (somewhere around Mac NW15 to NW25 if I had to guess). It dries down in 10 minutes, then it’s exercise- and water-resistant for 80 minutes. This one has serious staying power and usually takes a double cleanse (oil or micellar water followed by regular cleanser) to remove completely. It does dry out my lips (see the picture) and can be irritating on my undereye area, especially if I wasn't careful to layer my moisturizers beforehand. Best in this list for outdoor sports or hiking. This is my eighth bottle of this sunscreen, mainly becuase it's sold at my regular grocery store and it's an excellent shade match for my skin tone so I don't need to worry about blending it in.\n\n* I also have the UNTINTED version of this sunscreen, which I've been trying in desperation to use up for over a year. This is the ultimate sunscreen if you want ghost face. When I tried it the first time, my husband asked if I was wearing \"geisha makeup\" (he might have been joking, but my lord was the white cast bad). Try as I might, this does not work for body or face. It's real bad.\n\n* [Photos of the AG Tinted Here](https://imgur.com/a/fHjSGlM)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($11 for 89 mL), Walgreens/CVS ($13), or in grocery stores\n\n\n**Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul MC80, Tinosorb S\n\n* Japanese, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, and Cruelty Free (not Vegan!)\n\n* This combination sunscreen doubles as a makeup primer and makes you glow! It has a gel texture, is easy to spread around, and dries to a clear, dewy finish with zero white cast and a slightly tacky feel. I waited around a bit and the tackiness did go away after about half an hour. As a highlighter addict, I love that it makes me glow, and it lets me skip the primer step when I put on makeup. When I put makeup on top, it amplifies the colors and gives everything a nice shimmer to it. I usually use an illuminating primer as my base (Missha BB Boomer) but this more than takes its place. I've finished the first bottle, will definitely repurchase, and plan to give bottles to my sisters-in-law as birthday gifts. I only wish the little bottles were bigger!\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/DWwqBtP)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($9 for 40 mL) or Dokodemo ($8)\n\n\n**Amavara Tinted Transparent Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50 (PA/PPD unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Non-Nano Zinc Oxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Vegan, and Cruelty Free\n\n* Thick, non-greasy sunscreen with the texture of wet clay. This one is mainly included to give the Australian Gold tinted sunscreen a comparison point. It is slightly olive-tinted, while the Australian Gold is cool/pink toned. It dries to a matte finish, and can be slightly drying if you have dry skin. It is water-resistant for 80 minutes. There are several reviews from surfers on the Amazon page that vouch for its staying power. My mom originally bought this for herself, but the shade wasn't a good match for her so she gave it to me... even though we wear the same foundation shade. I'm giving this one away to an olive-toned friend.\n\n* Rather than wearing this on my face, I decided it would be more useful to do [swatches of the AG Untinted, AG Tinted, and this Amavara one](https://imgur.com/a/wE5PuPO)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon: $35 for 70 mL\n\n\n**Sonrei Sea Clearly Translucent Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 (PA/PPD unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Avobenzone\n\n* American, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Paraben Free, Reef Safe, Vegan, Gluten Free (Contains Palm Oil as First Ingredient)\n\n* I'll be honest: I bought this when I was drunk. I was browsing Into the Gloss and found an article about [sunscreen for people who don't like sunscreen](https://intothegloss.com/2019/08/clear-sunscreen-gel/). I had never heard of this brand before, but the antioxidant-rich formula caught my eye. It contains Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid (the same combo in several top Vitamin C serums), albeit at the end of the ingredients list. If the antioxidants in this product are actually effective, it would be an EXCELLENT morning multitasker and would solve my problem of finding a Vit C product that I actually like using. I reached out to the customer service team to ask about the PA/PPD rating, and received [this email in response](https://imgur.com/a/YNDWOGY) in less than 12 hours. It seems like they're really dedicated to the efficacy of their products and if I decide to repurchase I'll definitely check back to see their new test results.\n\n* The texture of this sunscreen is unlike any of the others on this list. It's thick and difficult to squeeze out of the tube. Once it's out, it looks like apricot jam with texture that feels almost exactly like vaseline. As I worked it into my face it melted and broke down into a thick oil, not unlike olive oil. There was little scent, but it irritated my eyes anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it did indeed dry down completely clear, if a bit uneven, and the greasiness mostly went away. I've included photos of it freshly applied and 20 minutes later when it was dry for comparison. As I walked around outside and sweated, it started to run down my face -- not okay when the UV index is 7! I do not think this one is a good match for me, but I thought of an alternate use for it: It performs beautifully as a brow gel to tame my unruly eyebrows! With the huge bottle I'll have enough to last the rest of my life (or until it expires).\n\n* [Swatch + Photos Outside, Inside/Wet, and Inside/Dry](https://imgur.com/a/E4U7TD9)\n\n* Buy it on the Sonrei website: $25 for 3.4 oz\n\n\n**Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Uvinul A, Uvinul T 150\n\n* Korean, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Vegan, Cruelty Free\n\n* 70% water base, hyaluronic acid, and four different types of “green” essences, it works like a moisturizing, calming cream. The “green” ingredients are derived from centella asiatica, a medicinal herb that hydrates, promotes wound healing, treats eczema/dermatitis, and reduces inflammation. There is another version of this product that contains essential oils and fragrance – this unscented one is the \"safer\" version for sensitive skin. This one is frequently compared to the Dear Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence, which I did not include in this review because of the price. \n\n* I noticed a subtle green-correcting effect when I wore this; it helped to calm down redness and make it less noticeable. It's not as pronounced as the Dr Jart+ Tigergrass or Cica products (which are literally green-tinted), but I think it makes a difference. The finish is pearlescent (not shiny, just a nice healthy dewiness) and it works well under makeup. My skin was noticeably calmer, less red, and less reactive, even at the end of a full day of wear. This has become the sunscreen I reach for most often (even more than my beloved Skin Aqua milk!) and I've already repurchased two additional bottles.\n\n* [Photos From Three Days of Wear](https://imgur.com/a/iqwhPgL)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 60 mL), YesStyle ($14), or Jolse ($15)\n\n\n**Purito Comfy Water Sun Block, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Non-Nano Zinc Oxide\n\n* Korean, Reef Safe, Alcohol Free, Silicone Free, Vegan, Cruelty Free (Contains Essential Oils)\n\n* This is the mineral version of the one directly above. I heard about it from [Gothamista's 2019 mineral sunscreen review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMbO5RyUkUI). The formula has 70% water, hyaluronic acid, and centella asiatica. That review described it as \"highly hydrating, soothing, and disappears immediately into the skin with a silk, skin-like finish.\" My experience was COMPLETELY different. This was hands-down the most disappointing sunscreen I tried. When I first squeezed it out of the tube, I was hit with strong fragrance. This has orange peel oil, tea tree oil, and lavender oil. It smelled like I walked into a Bath & Body Works aromatherapy sale circa 2008. Eyes watering, I attempted to apply it the usual way (rubbing it in) and found that it wasn't cooperating at all. I switched to patting, which was somehow even worse. It never sank into my skin; instead it balled up and got even drier. The more I worked on it, the worse it got. It was like trying to rub zinc diaper cream into my face. There was no way to achieve anything close to even coverage. I didn't even leave the bathroom, I had to wash it off right away!\n\n* In the interest of full disclosure, my experience runs contrary to every other review I read about this product -- everyone else seems to have no problem getting it to blend in and most describe the scent as \"subtle\" or \"refreshing.\" I ordered this and the Green Level sunscreens from the Purito storefront on Amazon, and received a handful of legit-looking Purito foil samples with my order. I don't think this is a fake, so I think it must be the result of a bad batch. Honestly, this was so disappointing that I'm not going to order the unscented version (newly released in August). If you want to try this out, definitely go for the unscented one!\n\n* [Indoor-Only Photos](https://imgur.com/a/xs51wgk)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 60 mL), YesStyle ($15), or Jolse ($15)\n\n\n**Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk, SPF 50+, PA+++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\n* Korean, Contains Alcohol\n\n* This physical sunscreen starts as a thick white cream, and the marketing says it dries clear with a matte finish. The alcohol evaporates quickly, making this sunscreen one of the fastest-drying (under a minute). It contains aloe and centella extract (soothing ingredients) to help balance the drying effect of the alcohol. I found that it tended to clump up on the baby hairs on my face and neck, and the white cast only increased as it settled on my face. In one picture I have a lovely white moustache and a streaky white neck, and in another photo there are visible white lines where it creased on my eyelids. In the \"indoor\" photo you can see how ghastly I looked after being outdoors for half an hour. After several hours of wear my skin was dry, red, and not happy. I struggled to use this up on my arms and legs because of the clumping and white cast, but eventually emptied the bottle. Will not repurchase.\n\n* [Photos Here from Two Separate Days](https://imgur.com/a/ILON6wK)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($10 for 55 mL) or Jolse ($12, shipping from Korea)\n\n\n**Missha All-Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel, SPF 50+, PA+++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Homosalate, TEA-Salicylate, Escalol 517, Tinosorb S, Amiloxate, Octocrylene\n\n* Korean, Contains Alcohol\n\n* This chemical sunscreen is absolutely invisible on the skin, and you can even double or triple layer it without looking like a zombie. Water- and sweat- resistant, which makes it a good option for outdoor activities. The potential downside is the alcohol content (fifth ingredient) which supposedly evaporates upon application and helps it dry down more quickly, similar to the Etude House one above. This one was extremely irritating for me -- my PIE and rosacea flared up immediately, and the alcohol sting did not abate as I wore it. My skin felt tight and warm until I was able to wash it off. I used this exactly twice, and will not repurchase. I gave this bottle to my husband to keep in his work bag.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/L0IY2XQ)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 50 mL), YesStyle ($11), or Jolse ($13)\n\n\n**Walgreens Sensitive Skin Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 (PPD/PA unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Octocyrlene\n\n* American, Fragrance Free, Oil Free\n\n* This combo sunscreen is extremely cheap (it's a HUGE bottle) and free from oxybenzone and avobenzone -- but that's pretty much all it has going for it. It goes on chalk white, but with a little work it rubs in mostly clear but never dries down completely. My face was shiny and my eyes streaming from the burning feeling on my skin. The label claims it's water resistent for 80 minutes, but it started dissolving just minutes after I went outdoors and started to sweat. As it melted off my face, I looked greasier than ever. I'm also not convinced that the filters (5% zinc, 4% octocrylene) are high enough for this to be effective for us photosensitive folks. I've relegated this one to Team Body Sunscreen, and will not repurchase.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/PDKutDh)\n\n* Buy it at Walgreens ($11 for 236 mL or 8 oz) in the U.S. I'm sure there's a CVS generic equivalent product as well.\n\n\n**Vanicream Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 (PPD/PA unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free, Lanolin Free, Paraben Free\n\n* When I first started my retinoid routine, my dermatologist told me to go to the drugstore and pick up Vanicream everything. It's her go-to brand for people with sensitive skin, and it's easy to see why. Vanicream is very concerned with avoiding \"harmful chemicals,\" so most of their ingredients lists are short and the products are no-frills. Like any all-mineral American sunscreen, it goes on chalk white and takes a good amount of elbow grease to work into my skin -- \"grease\" being the operative word. The white cast mostly went away, but I was still a little pallid a couple hours later. It leaves me slightly sticky/tacky until it dries completely (takes about 20 minutes) and after that happens it's bulletproof. It claims to be water-resistant for 80 minutes and it is absolutely correct: no amount of rain, tears, or chlorinated water can make this stuff budge. Like the Australian Gold one above, it takes a thorough two-step cleanse to remove at night, and balms/oils perform better than micellar water or makeup remover.\n\n* [Indoor Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/RuVdbYm) (I didn't make it outside that day!)\n\n* Buy it at Walgreens/CVS/Drugstores ($15 for 113 mL or 4 oz) or Amazon ($17)\n\n\n**TOP PICKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n**Best for Sensitive or Reactive Skin**: Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk Blue Bottle (combination) or Vanicream Sunscreen (mineral)\n\n**Best for Oily Skin**: Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen Lotion (mineral) or Missha All-Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel (chemical)\n\n**Best for Dry Skin**: Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun (chemical)\n\n**Best for Under Makeup**: Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV (combination)\n\nIf anyone wants additional swatches, comparisons, or whatever -- let me know! I've still got every single one of these in my bathroom waiting to be used up in one way or another. Also, if anyone spots an error or can fill in missing information (such as PA/PPD data) please let me know! I'm happy to edit this post to supplement my impressions.\n\nSide Note: I had to take a longish break in the middle of my testing because of an eczema outbreak on my left cheek and jaw. You can see it in a couple of the photos (kind of looks like a mosquito bite). I stopped all new products and went back to a bare-bones routine, then eventually had to use a mild steroid treatment to clear up the eczema. This doesn't usually happen outside of the winter months, but all's fair in love and skincare.",

    "body": "*(P.S. Thank you soo much for all the upvotes🥺❤️! Updated the post with detailed shaving for crotch 😄)*\n\nI've been shaving my body from last 4-5 years. I'll mention what I follow :-\n\n(Do all this with **warm water.** Cold water would tighten your pores and won't give the comfortable finish)\n\n**LEGS 🦵🏻 -** \nFirstly, trim your hair using a electric body trimmer for a faster and easier shaving process. Rinse the hair and apply the shaving gel and create lather. Let it sit on for 30s to make the skin soft and hydrated. **DO NOT go against the grain on your thighs** ! I have done this in the past and it gives so much bumps and itchyness. Follow your natural hair growth and shave in that. Below the knees, you can go against the grain by just sliding the razor from up to down at first then down to up. \n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**BUTTOCKS 🍑 -** \nI don't like to use a trimmer to cut any excess hair as the skin over there might get agitated and create bumps later. Shaving procedure remains the same. The way I do it is I **stand in front of mirror and then shave by my instinct and then twist to see if everything's clear** (sounds funny lol because it is🥲😂).\n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**NEAR THE HOLE 🍩-**\nVery sensitive area and you have to go much slowly and not overdo or repeat the strokes. **For this, I usually do this after I finish my shower, I lie on my back and then spread my legs (like missionary position) and get a clear look of the centre and then watch in the mirror as I shave**. Again, a bit hard to do but works well after some practice :)\n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**CHEST AND BELLY🤰🏻 -**\nUse a trimmer on dry skin and trim all your hair well and good till the base. I sometimes prefer this as it gets the job done of smoothening. But if opting for shaving, the process remains the same. But *you may get an itch or redness for 2-3 days after you shave* against the grain. **DON'T** itch it a lot or else it will worsen the skin.\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\n**ARMPITS AND DICKY 🍆-** follow the same procedure as trimming longer hair, lathering and shaving with and then against the grain but very gently. This region also has very soft skin which may get irritated or cut fast so...make sure to take your time and lather enough! **Stretch the skin by your other hand to make the surface more uniformly planar for easier shave** :)\n\nThis is how I do and is probably the ideal way to go for shaving the crotch would be :-\n\n**For dicky 🍆:** Get yourself **slightly erected (semi)** and then work your way up near the pubic region first by foaming with shaving cream/gel and lathering 🧼😄 then slowly reach up the shaft and go along the grain. Once you're finished doing this, rinse the area thoroughly!\n\n**For balls 🍒:** You don't necessarily need to be hard or semi. But you have to make sure that you lather and foam is much better and gently! Then **take smaller segments of the skin on your testicles and gently stretch it and then run the razor to make that area smooth** 🪒😄and then finish off the remaining! And be very gently and calm! Keep rinsing and applying the cream again and again as you will have to see how much is left 😄and if you want, you can also go near to your perineum but it may be difficult to do so especially for a beginner so...better not for now! Apply an aftershave once you're done with this to prevent any infections in the area :)\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nGet yourself nice and cleansed in the shower but my recommendation would be **not use any bodywash or soap the same day** as these consists of chemicals which may cause irritation to the shaved area. So, I just **use a loofah sponge** and gently, under the warm shower, start swirling it around in circulation motion all over my body. This is called **exfoliation and is important to avoid bumpyness and dry dead skin left on the body** :) it *really* works!\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nAfter the shower, **use a moisturizer with less fragrance and no parabens** preferably (I use **Calosoft and Hymos lotion** as suggested by my dermat). Drop **2-3 drops of Tea Tree Essential Oil** in your moisturiser to avoid any acne/buttne on your skin :) (this can be optional as tea tree oil might be strong for some skin)\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\n**Optional pro-tip** : Your feet are as cute as your body :'D so make sure you prep the toes, nails and soles well. The same moisturiser works! But if you want the **skin to remain soft and supple, grab an ice cube 🧊 and slowly rub it before sleeping to increase circulation and make them pink and soft naturally! The same can be done for your face if you're suffering from acne!** *It works wonders for real* 🦶🏻🧏🏻‍♂️\n\n                             ---------------------------------        \n\n**Clean/change your bedsheet that particular day** as your bedsheet may have dirt or bacteria which might irritate or cause skin to get infected due to open pores after shaving.\n\n                             ---------------------------------\n\n**GETTING PRICKY INGROWN HAIR AND BUMPS?!😞** Absolutely normal :) you gotta know the way to treat them well! This is what I do if it happens to me :-\n\n• **Apply a cold compress** to suppress the area and eventually increase blood circulation due to cold temperature ; \n\n• **Use Aloe Vera gel** directly extracted from the Aloe plant combined with the nectar/essence from my Agave plant and use it twice a day to soothe and calm the sensation ; \n\n• **Sit in a warm bath** which will relax the area and eventually shrink the bumps or lessen them, especially if it also has some pus from a possible ingrown hair situation ; \n\n• **Use a cream which consists hydrocortisone, witch hazel, aloe vera or benzoyl peroxide** to make the irritated area heal. You can get these creams on any dispensary or medical store.\n\nIf these still don't make the bumps go within a week or so, I prefer to make a visit to my dermatologist for medications :) this has never happened so far though!\n\n                           --------------------------------------\n\n**GOT A CUT WHILE SHAVING🥺😱!?!**\nNo need to panic at all :) We've all been there! I've cut myself a few times and it's mostly either because I wasn't lathered and relaxed the skin enough or it was an area where I am not able to see clearly hence, my instincts go wrong :/ In such a case, **immediately stop shaving that area and just sit or have that area rinsed in cold shower. If you're bleeding, keep washing with cold water until bleeding stops. Finish your shower and gently apply an antiseptic in a cotton ball (ouch😣but it's going to save you😄)! And throw that particular blade and get a new one!** After that, make sure atleast for a day not to irritate or rub the area by anything! Small cuts heal in a day :)\n\n                            ---------------------------------\n\nHope this helps to you all❤️ Any suggestions or questions from other people are most welcome in the comments :'D!",

    "body": "Hi r/skincareaddiction! Long time lurker, first time poster here. \n\nI have struggled with sensitive skin for most of my life and eyelid eczema for the past 7-8 years. I finally gave in and got patch testing done at the dermatologist. I found limited information online about what the experience was actually like, so I wanted to recap the experience for others and include some pictures, as well.\n\n\nDay 1: Monday\n\nI went in to the derm and got the patches put on.\n\n[Picture of the patches on my back here.](https://i.imgur.com/FRnEp0d.jpg)\n\n[Here’s a picture of me all taped up immediately after.](https://i.imgur.com/do5Oghn.jpg)\n\nThey put the tape on to help keep the patches in place until Wednesday. It felt a little stiff with the two layers of tape on my back, but nothing unmanageable.\n\nNo showers until after the final appointment on Friday. I was able to clean myself as best I could with my detachable showerhead. I basically washed my hair hunched over, upside down in my shower, but you could wash your hair in the sink. I only have a shower (no bathtub), otherwise I would have run a shallow bath. The most important thing is to not get your back wet! \n\nFor the whole week, you also need to abstain from activities that make you sweat. So no working out or anything. \n\nI arranged to work from home for most of the week, but I did go into the office on Tuesday. I felt like I would feel super gross from not being able to shower, but honestly, the working from home wasn’t really necessary. It really wasn’t that bad!\n\n\nDay 3: Wednesday\n\nI was grateful to get the tape off! I felt like my back couldn’t breathe so I was sweating underneath the tape (even though I wasn’t moving around much).\n\n[Here’s a picture immediately after they took the tape off.](https://i.imgur.com/PqGRXPW.jpg)\n\nMost of the redness is irritation from the tape. After they took it off, I relaxed on my side for about 30 minutes, then they came back in and took another look at the reactions. I had 7 reactions (more on this below). They also redrew the lines on my back with a sharpie.\n\nSo then, I went home without tape, but I still couldn’t shower or do sweaty activities. I wore black or dark-colored shirts during the day and to bed the rest of the week, since I was afraid the sharpie would rub off (and it did).\n\n\nDay 5: Friday\n\nFinal appointment! Woohoo.\n\n[Here’s the final pic from Friday.](https://i.imgur.com/31f2cRo.jpg)\n\nYou can especially notice the reaction on the left side of the pic (#5). This is p-phenylenediamine. It’s commonly found in hair dyes. When I used to dye my hair, I would have a bad reaction every time, so this result wasn’t surprising.\n\nThe other severe one was #39 on the top right side. This is nickel! I had no idea I had a nickel allergy.\n\n\nMy allergens\n\nFound out on Wednesday about:\n\nPropylene glycol\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate\n\nColophony\n\nP-phenylenediamine\n\nShellac\n\nNickel\n\nPropolis\n\n\nFound out on Friday about:\n\nMajantole\n\nPotassium dichromate\n\nTea tree oil\n\n\nCost:\n\nThey checked with my insurance in advance. Insurance said they’d cover the procedure. I had to pay a $50 specialist copay for each visit (so $150 total). I just checked and one insurance claim has been submitted and paid in full (not sure if there will be additional claims for each visit).\n\nOverall thoughts:\n\nI’m super glad I did this, but obviously disappointed that I’m allergic to so many things. Some of these ingredients are in skincare products traditionally thought of to be fragrance free, hypoallergenic, good for sensitive skin, etc (many Clinique, Aveeno, Olay, Vanicream, etc products). They recommended I stick with “free and clear” type products. I think that with all these reactions, there’s a chance that I could be allergic to more stuff they didn’t test for, so sticking to products with few ingredients is probably best. Also, many of my allergens have 10-20 different names each, so I created an excel spreadsheet to better search for potential allergens in my products.\n\nThis has also been an interesting experiment learning about each of the ingredients in products I use. I found polyethylene and polyester in a few products - these are forms of plastic!\n\nIf anyone has any particular brands or products I should take a look at, I’d love to hear about them!\n\nHappy to answer any questions.\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit 2: thanks for the silver! I’ve never gotten silver before so I’m honored!!\n\nEdit 3: gold?!? I’ve never gotten gold before either!!! Thank you so much! Who knew my experience not showering for a week would earn me gold 🤣",

I’ll never know if it was due to how severely I reacted to the things I was allergic to for the patch testing or if it was related to the flu shot I got that year that did contain thimerosal (before I knew I was allergic). Now I just get the preservative-free shot. Anyhow, I’m super glad I got it done but it was super miserable to go through!",

Two summers ago, I started experiencing eczema on my eyelids as well as swelling sometimes. I couldn’t figure out what it was so I was poke tested and then patch tested. My poke testing showed I was allergic to every tree, weed, and grass they tested for, except for red cedar. I already knew my allergies got bad for pollen and during those seasons where pollen allergies spike. When I got patch tested, they only had me keep it on for 2 days, but I had to follow the same rules. I got tested for 70 different kinds of common chemicals and to my dismay, had a reaction to none of them. It broke my heart and I almost wanted to cry in the doctors office. Let me tell you, it’s so much better knowing what you’re allergic to, even if it’s a lot, than not knowing. As of right now, the only thing that “triggers” my allergic reactions that i know of is pollen but when i have eczema break outs on my eyelids, I can never tie it directly to an event that’s happened and it’s very disheartening. I’m glad you got a successful allergy testing story though!",

Would really like to know your experience with the actual irritation/results!\n\nHope you’re doing well after that btw",

Good luck with contacting companies if there isn't enough information. I haven't been able to get inactive ingredient info for a couple bug sprays for an up coming Mexico trip. I have asked about laundry detergent as there were no ingredients listed, the ingredients list they sent literally listed the word \"preservative\" for it's preservatives. A nail polish company said they don't have a set ingredient list for a top coat. One company said they didn't know what their products were made of. Another said theirs didn't have fragrance added, but when I got it, it most definitely had fragrance added that just smelling the cap required I take benadryl.

        "body": "Thanks for posting this! Did they test you for sunscreens? I want to do it, mostly because I react to every chemical sunscreen I've tried as well as a lot of mineral formulas but apparently my eczema isn't bad enough for the doctor to refer me. Plus I'm doing allergy shots for tree pollen allergies, I'll probably have to wait until next fall to do patch testing just to avoid any interactions.\n\nI don't know if any of these are helpful for you, they really helped me:\n\nWhen I got tested for environmental allergies several years ago, my doctor (board-certified allergist) said I also have [Oral allergy Syndrome](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/library/allergy-library/outdoor-food-allergies-relate). Basically, bring allergic to certain pollens can make you react to some foods, you'll get an itchy throat or feel nauseated. When I eliminated apples, cherries, tree nuts, soy, and green peas from my diet that helped my skin immensely.\n\nI read a book called _Beyond Soap_ a few months ago because I was tired of always having irritated skin. It's by a Canadian dermatologist, it's really informative in a general way about what to avoid if you have eczema and haven't figured out what's causing it. There's a companion website with recommended products for skincare & household cleaning: www.producteliminationdiet.com. I already knew I was sensitive to fragrance, but getting rid of all essential oils including in room sprays helped, and using CeraVe works for me. Apparently essential oil diffusers are causing a lot of cases of eye irritation. Hair products also cause a lot of eye irritation, but finding good fragrance free hair products is difficult.\n\nAlso for whatever reason doing a mostly fungal acne safe routine helped my skin. [The Fungal Acne Treatment Bible](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) was my intro to this, there's a lot of other good posts on that site.\n\nI think these three changes helped reduce inflammation in my body & skin. I also avoid dairy in my diet and am trying to eat better. It was weird to learn that tree nuts are actually inflammatory for me because of my allergies, they're always recommended in anti inflammatory diets.\n\nGood luck finding new products! I'm actually starting to get more into DIY beauty stuff because of my sensitivities, but I'm not finding a lot of useful formulas online.",

Finally we found an allergist who offered t.r.u.e. patch testing.  Her results showed she was allergic to carba mix which I believe is the same as iodopropynyl butylcarbamate.  We learned that the shampoo she was using contained this ingredient (~carbamate was listed pretty far down the ingredient list) so as soon as she stopped using this shampoo her skin got better. We were thankful that we were able to figure out what was causing the rash with just a True test which only tests for 36 ingredients. We were told by the allergist that sometimes you have to do further patch tests to get the root of the problem and in some instances you will never get an answer.  What was also interesting for us was that we also brought in some make up that she used that we thought might have caused the rash. The doctor made a patch test for those too and sure enough Nars concealer was a culprit but we couldn’t find carba mate or any one if its moniker variation in the ingredient list. There is definitely some other chemical she is allergic to that we don’t know about. However we switched out all her make up to Beauty Counter and Almay and she hasn’t had any problems.  Also just a note, make up wipes seem to contain carbamate.  Other surprises were Dove soaps (including sensitive skin formula) and some Elta Md sunscreen.",

    "body": "### **Step 1: PREP LIKE A PRO**  \n*(Skip this and you’ll regret it. Trust.)*  \n\n1. **Exfoliate First**  \n   - Scrub your legs/body with a *gentle* exfoliator (use a loofah or washcloth).  \n   - Why? Gets rid of dead skin + stops ingrown hairs. *No red bumps, pls.*  \n\n2. **Soften the Canvas**  \n   - Shave after a warm shower. Steam opens pores = smoother glide.  \n   - No time? Soak area with a warm washcloth for 2 mins.  \n\n3. **Lube. It. Up.**  \n   - Use shaving cream (not soap!!).  \n   - Budget hack? Babyoil (no diddy :3).  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON**  \n*(Razors matter pookie.)*  \n\n- **Best Razors for Femboys**:  \n  - *Cardridge razors* pretty safe but can cause irritation\n  - *Safety Razor*: Closer shave, less irritation (but ur gonna cut tf outta urself at the beginning).  \n  - *Electric Razor*: Philips OneBlade if you’re lazy (but not as smooth, looks smooth on pics tho).  \n\n- **DON’T**:  \n  - Use a dull blade. Swap it every 3-5 shaves. *Rusty razors = hell no.*  \n  - Press too hard. Let the razor glide—no bulldozing your skin.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: SHAVING TECHNIQUE**  \n*(Mastery of the BLADE)*  \n\n- **Direction Matters**:  \nI would say, go with the grsin for all areas first and try going against on the tougher and more resistent spots. \n\n- **Pro Moves**:  \n  - Short strokes > long drags.  \n  - Rinse blade after every swipe. Clogged razors = uneven shave.  \n  - Stretch the skin taut (esp. knees, ankles). Wrinkles = cuts.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: POST-SHAVE S.O.S.**  \n*(No sting, no stress.)*  \n\n1. **Rinse with Cold Water**  \n   - Closes pores + reduces redness. \n\n2. **Pat Dry, Don’t Rub**  \n   - Your skin’s sensitive, not a potato. Be gentle.  \n\n3. **Moisturize Like Your Life Depends on It**  \n   - Use a fragrance-free lotion (Cerave, Cetaphil) or ALOE VERA GEL (this one goes hard).  \n   - Extra femme touch? Add a shimmer body oil.\n\n4. **Kill the Bumps**  \n   - Mix 1 tsp tea tree oil + 1 cup water. Dab on irritated spots.  \n   - Or use Tend Skin (holy grail for ingrowns).  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: MAINTAIN THE SLAY**  \n*(Smooth 24/7? Yes cutie.)*  \n\n- **Exfoliate 2-3x/week** to prevent ingrown hairs.  \n- **Shave every 2-3 days** if you want smooth twinky skin.  \n- **Hair Growing Back Itchy?** Use hydrocortisone cream (tiny amount!).  \n\n\n---\n\n### **Emergency Kit** 🚑  \n- **Cuts**: Press a tiny piece of toilet paper on it till bleeding stops.  \n- **Razor Burn**: Cold compress + aloe. *No picking!*  \n\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note**  \nYes being smooth is amazing. But in the end most of us are amab. That means that our skin and hair is significantly thicker. Its ok to not be perfectly smooth. Take it slow and get comfy with shaving. Try making it a routine before you wanna perfect it. Luv you pookie <3\n\nFor 1:1 advice, questions or a wholesome community, check out: https://www.reddit.com/u/Chance-Repair-4167/s/2KKRpJZSbV",

For closeted or secret inspiring  Femboys this is a an absolute must have.\n\nAlso unlike normal razors which quite frankly aren't safe or sanitary to use on your skins more than 1-3 uses.  The blade design eliminates the issue of hard to clean multi blade razors which become clogged with dead skin, hair, shaving products and plenty of bacteria. All of which will only lead to more razor bumps, razor burn, nicking skin from blade becoming unaligned\\ out place and subsequently cuts or open skin that have the potential to escalate to more serious infections. I once got MRSA on a small zit on neck which spread to a razor bump my left butt check through from reuse of a normal razor or just me being me having the infection on my hands and not washing them before having any idea I have contracted a Staph infection in the first place. No pain can be describe when a butt cheek becomes so inflamed the swelling presses ur cheeks together and there is not way to sit stand of even lay comfortably because their is no way to hold ur body to avoid contact with the sensitivity area with out going spread eagle both your legs behind ur head like Riley Reid .",

    "body": "**I am not OP.**\n\nPosted by [u/imseriousdonttouchme](https://www.reddit.com/user/imseriousdonttouchme/) on [r/PointlessStories](https://www.reddit.com/r/pointlessstories)\n\n[Original + All Updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/6w0zym/a_butterfly_was_thrown_onto_me_in_the_bus_and_now/) \\- 5+ years ago\n\nSo, this isn't exactly pointless but I don't know where else to post this, so let me know.\n\nI'm a high school student. I was taking the bus home when, halfway into it, a butterfly got caught in the wind and was thrown into the bus. It landed on my arm. I looked down and realized it was there, so I picked it up and cupped it in my hand. It was only on its back and didn't respond at all. Everyone on the bus was freaking out and they also said it was dead. I held onto it because I didn't feel like it was. I noticed his foot was bent and he couldn't use it.\n\nWhat do you know, 5 minutes later it started to move, very slowly. Everyone freaked out again. I sat there for 10-15 minutes with it on my hand. It even tried to fly once, but it mostly just flopped around on my hand.\n\nPeople were saying to let it out the window, but I didn't want it to get hurt again. I kept it in my hand for the entire time. I carried it to my house. I have butterfly plants in my backyard, so I set it on one of those.\n\nIt fell off of the plant later on because the wind was too strong. I put my hand near it, and it ran towards my hand with no hesitation and started to climb up my arm. I had to push it off onto a plant.\n\nHowever, it kept falling off and it was about to rain, so my mom said to take it inside. I placed a piece of watermelon near it. Now it's chilling near this piece of watermelon. His proboscis is twitching so I hope he's about to eat it. His leg has curled up to his body, so he's walking on 3 legs. I don't think that's a good sign. He is moving freely now though.\n\nI'm not really sure if I'm doing the right thing to help its survival. Help is appreciated.\n\nI'll update this if anyone is interested on if he survives or not.\n\n**Pictures:** [https://imgur.com/a/teV5C](https://imgur.com/a/teV5C)\n\n**Update:** it looks like his bad leg and proboscis is slowly extending. Hope that's good.\n\n**Update:** he's sort of using his leg now. It's completely out and on the ground but it's like he's not putting any weight on it. Still hasn't had any of the watermelon.\n\n**Update:** Nothing has happened. He's been completely still, so I don't know what to think. ): I'm going to add an apple near him too.\n\n**Update:** I have offered hummingbird juice stuff, a banana, and watermelon but he hasn't had any of it. I just took it away because I didn't want it to attract any bugs towards him. It's getting late so I took him inside. Not sure if that's the right thing to do. Not gonna lie, it's not looking too great guys, he doesn't move at all. He still responds if I move it and whatnot, but otherwise he does nothing. He loves to be on my fingers I guess, because he doesn't want to get off when I pick him up. If I push him then he gets on the hand that I'm pushing him with.\n\n**Update:** For time reference, I found him around 2:50 and I'm writing this update at 11:50. So...this is what has been going on for the past three hours. I brought him into my room and was going to pick him up to put him near a bottle cap full of sugar water. However, he immediately curled his legs like a dead fly. I started to cry, honestly. It wasn't responsive for a while until it started to shake. I Googled it, turns out he was cold. I picked him up and used my breath to breathe hot air on him. This helped him. I then force fed him the sugar water, though I don't know if he could actually get it because his proboscis was coiled up but this also seemed to help. He started to flutter his wings a tiny bit. He was shaking more. I have spent the past two hours breathing hot air on him and then force feeding him sugar water. Two hours in, I found a heating pad and sat him on that with cloth in between so it's not too hot. I'm not surprised that he most likely won't make it, I knew he had a slim chance of survival since the first time I saw him. He has slowly been becoming less responsive. He is still alive because he is still shaking. I feel like this is all my fault. I will keep him laying on the heating pad and occasionally force feed him.\n\n**More pictures:** [https://imgur.com/a/GiPLb](https://imgur.com/a/GiPLb)\n\nAssuming he's going to die in my care, what should I do? Should I bury him or keep him displayed? I have another butterfly displayed in a glass frame and I was wondering if that would be okay to do the same to him. I don't know how to preserve a butterfly though.\n\n**Update:** It's the next day. He died around midnight last night. I'm not surprised but I am sad. I know no one is probably interested anymore, but I've decided to try to display him. I'll update with how that process is going. Right now, his wings are being held open and kept in Tupperware in the freezer. That's a vague description but yeah. I know there's a good possibility of error since I have no experience displaying butterflies, but I'll try my best. Rest in peace, my butterfly friend ):\n\n**Update:** The kind words have made me very happy. Thank you all so much. Thank you to those that helped me identify him, also thank you to whoever gilded me! I never expected that! It's hard for me to respond to every message now, but I do read every single one of them. I've been getting some suggestions on how to properly display him, but it looks like most people are getting information from how beetles are displayed instead of butterflies. Not saying this is wrong, I don't really know what I'm doing, but I searched specifically how to preserve a butterfly and they all say something along the lines of pinning it open, putting it in the freezer, and so forth. Right now, I have him on Styrofoam in the freezer, inside a Tupperware container. I spread his wings and put baking sheets over them independently, pinning the baking sheet down around his wings (not into the wings). I was told to keep him spread open like this. I'm thinking of keeping him like this until Friday. In the meantime, I'm getting a frame and more Styrofoam. Also, I'm taking a risk, but I was worried about mold growing so I put three drops of tea tree oil on his body (not the wings). If this doesn't work out, then of course I'll just bury him, maybe plant something over him. Let me know any suggestions.\n\n**Pictures-** Him climbing on my arm while I was trying to get him on some flowers: [https://gfycat.com/coldminorbinturong](https://gfycat.com/coldminorbinturong)\n\n[https://imgur.com/mlQ6qUa](https://imgur.com/mlQ6qUa)\n\nWhat I'm aiming for the display to look like: [https://imgur.com/Ps1rQfa](https://imgur.com/Ps1rQfa)\n\n**Update four-ish days later:** Butterfly is still doing well in the freezer. I got my frame today and I'll be trying to put him in on Monday, since I'll be gone this entire weekend.\n\n**Final Update:** Came back early this weekend so I finished his display today. I like how it turned out: [https://imgur.com/a/jGhxc](https://imgur.com/a/jGhxc) I'm going to a put a quote from someone in the comments, as well as the story and the type of butterfly on the back. I'll also probably include some of my favorite comments and PMs, since I'm glad you all have supported me with this. (I'll also probably go through and make this post a little easier to read and fix typos.) Feel free to still send me any messages no matter how old this post is. Thank you guys (:",

He was also shaking like the butterfly in OPs post, and that’s when I also learned they could get cold! So I tried to breath on him which sort of worked, but he wasn’t moving much and I was afraid he was dying. \n\nAfter more googling, I found that he most likely needed some sort of sugar and thankfully I had a banana on me so I tore off a chunk and tried to give it to him, but it seemed like he wasn’t very interested in it. Also didn’t seem super interested in drops of water. He just kinda slowly shuffled around, slowly opening and closing his wings and curling/unfurling his proboscis. (This was actually super rad to see up close since most butterflies won’t let you get so close to them) \n\nMy class was starting soon and I didn’t want to just leave him, so as a last ditch effort I took a chunk of banana and kinda… scooped him up to it to hopefully “force” him to eat some, and no joke the difference within just a few seconds was night and day! Lil guy immediately perked up and started flapping his wings a lot faster and walking with more energy, and after a few more minutes he was able to fly off. \n\nSo unfortunate the butterfly in OPs post didn’t mKe it, but I’m glad she was able to honor the lil guy with preserving his beautiful body. I was actually thinking of doing the same if he had died, as well, and was trying to figure out how I could preserve him during class before I got home. Thankfully I didn’t need to do any of that and he lived to fly another day! \n\nI have a bunch of pictures but I’m not sure how to add them, or if it would even be okay on a BorU post, but I wanted to share my little butterfly story because it was so similar.",

Same symptoms. I spent much $$ on all different brands of lipstick to test. (This was before Sephora.) I could wear lipstick about an hour before the swelling got too bad. I'd start the night with lipstick and end with vaseline. I was successful with mixing in loose eye shadow pigment with vaseline, but it was usually too much work.\n\n It came on sudden, not like I wore a lot of makeup before, but I was able to wear lip products my junior year. A couple of years before I got married at 27 I noticed I could wear lipstick for longer without getting itchy. I think Bite was the first I could wear successfully for long periods. Now I'm fine with most products, but I haven't tried lipstains nor those lip pumping products. Because why? Everything used to be a plumping product. I also find chapstick and lipsmackers to be too drying still, I like Burts Bees.\n\nSo now I can wear lipstick again, but don't now because no one can see it under a mask. I had no allergies growing up, lip products was the first and only for about a decade. Led to funny looks on medical history forms. The body is weird.",

After staying indoors at the beginning  of the pandemic pretty much all day every day, I didn’t use my sunscreen cuz ya know didn’t need it then. I go back to work eventually so u start back up with the sunscreen. I had developed some type of photo allergic reaction to this sunscreen and most chemical UV protectants.

    "body": "Still in the process of clearing my face of acne, but started adopting the \"less is more\" approach and have made tremendous strides in just the past week! Hoping to share my experience to get additional suggestions and hopefully provide a plausible direction for other people going through a similar struggle.\n\nPreviously, I'd tried all kinds of acne medication and other treatments (benzoyl peroxide, tea tree oil, Aztec healing clay, differin gel, etc.); although pimples would heal, new ones would form.\n\nAfter 2 years of this frustrating cycle, I decided that acne might be a symptom of a larger issue. I adjusted my usage of a lot of products that were drying my skin out, to prioritize restoring my moisture barrier. My current routine:\n\n\nAM:\n- wash with cold/room temp water \n- moisturize with CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin\n- thin layer of Vaseline \n\nPM:\n- wash with cold/room temp water \n- moisturize with CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Normal to Dry Skin\n- thin layer of benzoyl peroxide\n- thin layer of differin gel \n- thin layer of Vaseline \n\n\nApplication of Vaseline in particular, has been a game changer. It helps my skin retain its moisture, and combats the drying side effects of benzoyl peroxide and differin at night. \n\nOver the past week, I've had virtually no new pimples form and now it just seems to be a waiting game for the old ones to heal and PIH to fade. From my limited understanding, my face's moisture barrier had been damaged so not only was bacteria able to access my pores, my skin was not retaining the moisture from any of my moisturizing products. Consequently, my skin would dry out and clog up my pores. Vaseline allows my skin to hold on to moisture, while blocking out external dirt and bacteria.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any additional improvements/corrections or advice, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions I could answer! There's light at the end of the tunnel, be optimistic and resilient -- you WILL find something that works for your skin!! Will keep this post updated on my progress\n\nEdit: additional notes\n- limit sugar, dairy, fried food, alcohol\n- hydrate a lot\n- sleep early\n- Acne fking sucks, but I try my best to think of it as a blessing in disguise, my body's way of forcing me to lead a healthy lifestyle. Playing the long game here -- I'm going to have the best skin and health in the universe!",

I just finished dealing with my first navel stone.\n\nFor those that have never heard of them (I hadn't before today) naval stones are basically a blackhead inside of your belly button. Dirt and oil build up in there, and turns black when it oxidizes. They are almost undetectable unless they get infected.\n\nWell, this morning, I was cleaning myself, and noticed a couple of stray dog hairs in my belly button (it happens more than I'd like to admit...) so I grabbed my tweezers and got the hairs out, but I saw there was something else in there!\n\nFast forward through freaking out, googling the problem, trying to fix the problem myself, and calling my mom...\n\nI used some tea tree oil and softened the thing, and was able to gently pull it out with tweezers. I then cleaned my navel with astringent and put some neosporin on it.\n\nI know I should have probably had it removed by a doctor, but I dont have time or money to go see an American doctor for something so minor. But I also couldn't just leave it the way it was...\n\nTHIS THING WAS HUGE AND DISGUSTING! I couldnt stop staring at it before I disposed of it! Why am I weirdly intrigued by it?!?! I keep thinking about how cool it was. Cool and gross?!?! Why?!\n\nAnyway, I needed to share. I also wanted to let more people know about navel stones because I was super scared at first. If you have an Innie belly button, make sure to clean the inside with a q tip and some astringent! I know I will be from now on!\n\nEdit: Wow!! Thanks to everyone who read this. I didnt expect it to blow up. And thanks to the people that gave me my first flair and my first silver! I hope everyone has fun inspecting their belly buttons!",

I’ve been in therapy for six months and working towards not being afraid to socialize after traumatic DV situation that ended two years ago. \n\nI started a tea tree oil detox wash and notice a ton of changes to my skin near immediately. So I got a peppermint shampoo wash. \n\nMy scalp tingled and I put my hands in it I swear it felt like sticking your hand in a bag of pop rocks after adding water. There was a reaction going on that felt so strange it’s really hard to describe, lice mass extinction event I suppose.  \n\nI flipped my hair upside down to wash it out a few minutes later and the water was a dark gray to near black color. \n\nWhen I dried my hair, my hair line had changed. there line where my hair had just had build up so thick and extensive it was a few centimeters into my forehead so when the wash cleared it, now I have a tan line out a bit from my actual hair line. \n\nI’m horrified about how immediate the change was. \n\nI grabbed scissors and cut my hair from waist length to above the shoulders. Not the best job I’m sure but I just couldn’t take the thought of what wasn’t rinsed out hanging around me. \n\nThat was last night, now I’ve already talked to a telehealth doc and got some pointers and working on finding a PCP to follow up. \n\nI can’t believe how many “build up clearing” shampoos I bought. I was even at a derma doctor about three years ago for body itching and mole removal and they didn’t indicate I had any problems. Although that office totally sucked for a variety of reasons it may not be so obvious. \n\nHow did I not notice this? \n\nThe physical changes I’ve felt just starting addressing this is wild, it’s like a weight off my face and neck I didn’t even know I was carrying. \n\nI have so much to do, so much to replace, so much to clean. The idea that some of my chronic symptoms could clear up is so exciting though. \n\nInsanely overwhelmed, deeply embarrassed, but here to say build up won’t go away? Try peppermint and look for lice.  \n\n",

Companies that treat lice infections can not tell you about it, but if you ask them, most will tell you. \n\n\"Ivermectin, both in topical lotion and oral tablet form, is used to treat head lice infestations. Topical ivermectin lotion, such as Sklice, is approved for individuals 6 months and older. It kills lice and prevents newly hatched lice from surviving. Oral ivermectin tablets are also effective, often used when other treatments have failed. \n\nTopical Ivermectin (Lotion):\nMechanism: Ivermectin lotion binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels in lice, causing paralysis and death. \nApplication: Applied to dry hair and scalp, left on for 10 minutes, then rinsed off. \nEffectiveness: Kills lice and prevents newly hatched lice from surviving. \nOvicidal: While not directly ovicidal (killing eggs), the lotion's effect on newly hatched lice prevents them from surviving. \nEfficacy: A single application is often sufficient, with no need for combing out nits (eggs). \nSafety: Generally well-tolerated, but avoid eye contact. \n\nOral Ivermectin (Tablets):\nMechanism: Similar to the topical form, ivermectin binds to chloride channels in lice, causing paralysis. \nUsage: Typically used when topical treatments have not been effective. \nDosage: A single oral dose of 200 micrograms/kg or 400 micrograms/kg, repeated in 9-10 days, can be effective, according to the CDC. \nEffectiveness: Can be highly effective, even against some resistant strains. \nSafety: Not FDA-approved for lice treatment, but generally considered safe when used as directed. \nConsiderations: Oral ivermectin is usually not a first-line treatment for lice.\"",

    "body": "I am a former hun or hunbot whichever you prefer. I accidentally came across this subreddit and it “literally changed my life.” See you guys showed me the truth about MLMs and how they are horrible awful no good companies who use people to prey on other people to prey on other people to prey on other—you get the picture. Thanks to you I found “the truth” and got out as fast as I could. Like lightening speed yall!\n\nTwo years ago I was in a bad place–financially, mentally, physically... you name the -ally and I (well we, my husband included) had made a mess of it. My “friend” posted on fb (which I shouldnt have trusted to begin with) about how awesome her new “starter kit” from Young Living was. And I have to speak my truth... I had been considering YL because I was using tea tree oil from Walmart at the time and it was nice. So I had heard my friends talk about YL versus Doterra and I had settled on YL. Anyway, just so happens my “friend” posted this at the exact right time that I was vulnerable and believed that you could make a million dollars from selling essential oils. She messaged me right away telling me [Jesus oil] cured her [disease] or whatever. Then I asked how you start selling and she was all too kind to put me in 8,549 facebook groups on how to “do the business.” Ugh I look back now and think what a schmuck I was. \n\nI will admit that I have had many doubts arise in the last two years and they all got immediately shut down by upline “leaders.” The main one was trying to help my “customers” (i.e., friends and family that I hounded to buy this “amazing” product) to use essential oils safely and effectively. How you ask? Well I wanted to become a certified aromatherapist because the only way I used oils was in my diffuser and on my skin in my lotion (not every single day). So I asked around the 8,549 “biz” groups where anyone got certified online and what did they like and not like about it. YALL! Young Living MLM Shitty Tactic Number One is DONT LET YOUR DOWNLINE LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT ESSENTIAL OIL SAFETY BY ACTUALLY LEARNING HOW TO SAFELY USE ESSENTIAL OILS. I kid you not, my saviors of r/antiMLM, 20,000 huns were like “dont waste your time” and “you dont need aromatherapy classes, we have all the education you will ever need” and “getting your aromatherapy certification will only delay the growth of your business” and crap like that. Ugh...\n\nThe number 2 tactic that I have realized since getting out that is complete shit is that you have to keep pushing FREEDOM in order to grow! You will never be free unless you sell essential oils—yall should know that by now (sarcasm here nice to meet you). I cannot have the freedom to work at home (because I have a debilitating chronic disease and have no choice) unless I sell oils. I cannot have the freedom to control my retirement unless I sell oils. I cannot have the freedom to give my future adopted kiddos all they will ever need unless I sell oils. Unless I sell oils I will never be free to do anything fun, exciting, glamorous, blahfuckingblah. I shit you not the day I decided I am done with this bullshit I felt more free than I had in two years! Its all a psychological game and since I was in a shitty place mental health wise/broke AF/marriage was crumbling and all that jazz, the tactics worked on me because that is how they are designed... to prey on the weak. You have no idea how free I feel that I don’t have to worry about OGV or ER or YL or GTFO or whatever. \n\nWhats funny is I always had a weird feeling about all of this but I was told it was just “fear” and “the devil trying to get in” and I was like “okay yeah true because Im depressed af and anxiety af and that has to be it! Its my own fault.” SUCH BULLSHIT! God I cant believe I let myself go on this long! My poor husband. He should be given a fucking trophy for putting up with this crap! When I told him I was getting out he said and I quite “OH THANK GOD! I love you and support whatever you want to do but this shit is stupid and you are so much better than this!” \n\nIf I hadn’t had found this subreddit (Im new is that what its called?) there is no telling what would have happened... oh wait yes there is—I would have spent a bunch of money I dont have in going to Utah for YL Convention because “you will see explosive growth after you go to convention!” and “its not just an investment in your business but an investment in yourself.” Ughhhh\n\nAlso I have to say that when I researched the upline leader that “started it all” (because havent all these Huns started it all?) I found out she has a master’s degree in... wait for it... Organizational Psychology! SHOCKER RIGHT?!\n\nAnd Ive also come to realize that selling some shitty product does not make you an entrepreneur in anyway whatsoever no matter what the Hunbots up top tell you. \n\nI feel dirty, used, ashamed, you name it. But thank you r/antiMLM for showing me “the way” because I feel like 8,549 lbs of bricks have lifted off my shoulders and now I know the truth about “wellness” and “freedom” and all that other bullshit psycho babble that I now see that all MLMs do. Oh wait “but we arent your typical MLM! We are different and we are #crushingit and can make you a #girlboss.” That was sarcasm in case you couldnt tell. \n\nEdit: realized there was doxxing info so I removed it.",

    "body": "I’ve seen an influx of comments recently that are absolutely terrible advice on how to heal an irritated piercing. If you are not an APP-informed piercer or haven’t read the side bar on proper aftercare, please stop commenting your own “at home remedies.” \n\nIf your piercing is red, has a bump, or you think you have a keloid or infection, the FIRST thing you need to do is LITHA. That stands for “leave it the hell alone.” The majority of piercing issues are caused by irritation, likely caused by touching/messing with the piercing or irritating it with products that shouldn’t be near the piercing at all. LITHA means: \n\n- DON’T use a Q-tip to clean around the piercing. Q-tips have small fibers that wrap around the piercing and cause further irritation. If you notice crusties near the piercing, they will likely wash away during your normal cleaning routine (we’ll go over that below). \n- DON’T touch the piercing with your hands in anyway. That includes moving it around during cleaning. Regardless of what your piercer said, you should NOT rotate or move the piercing around at any time, including during the cleaning process. If you piercer told you to rotate or move the piercing around during cleaning, that is bad/old advice that should not be followed. Those bumps you see that some of you think are keloids are frequently caused by the piercing moving too much. Your trying to heal an open wound and repetitively moving the piercing causes irritation because you’re essentially ripping/pulling the fragile, healing skin/scabs through the piercing hole. Rotating or moving the piercing around does not help the healing process, it slows it down and causes irritation bumps. \n- DON’T put any sort or paste, essential oil, tea, lotion, ointment, etc. on your piercing. Ever. This is terrible advice I keep seeing again and again. If your piercing has an issue, the ONLY way to properly heal it is to make sure your jewelry is the correct material and size (see below), make sure you’re cleaning it properly and make sure you LITHA. NEVER put aspirin, tea tree oil, tea bags, neosporin, or ANY other lotion, ointment, etc. on your piercing. EVER. All of those “remedies” irritate the piercing and open it up to infection because there is no way to sterilize the material you’re leaving near the piercing. Even so, all of those items mentions contain highly irritating ingredients that will further hinder the healing process. I don’t care if you tried X, Y or Z and it worked for you, please stop telling others to use these at-home remedies. They are harmful to the piercing, period. \n\nNow that you know to stop touching your piercing and stop trying any at home remedies, here is what you should do: \n\nCleaning - your cleaning process should only consist of using a sterile fine mist wound wash, something similar to [this](https://www.neilmedpac.com/usa/product/neilmed-neilcleanse-piercing-aftercare-fine-mist/) twice a day. Spray the mist 2 inches away from the piercing. Don’t touch it with your hands. Then, follow by rinsing with sterile water, or, if you’re about to take a shower, you can let the shower water lightly run over the piercing. That’s it. Don’t touch it, don’t rotate it, don’t pick away the crusties, etc. If there are some really persistent crusties, you can very cautiously use a gauze square to gently wipe them away. Gauze doesn’t have the same small fibers that q-tips do and will allow you to gently remove any crusties, only when absolutely needed. Do not soak your piercing in a cup or any type of standing water, that opens it up to infection. The only proper way to clean your piercing is with the mist wound wash followed by clean, sterile water. Do not use Claire’s piercing solution, it contains irritating ingredients. \n\nWhat if I’ve cleaned my piercing properly but it’s still irritated/has a bump? You many not have the proper jewelry material or size. Use [this](https://safepiercing.org/picking-your-piercer/) website to find a reputable piercer near you that can help determine if you need to switch out the jewelry. Please read [this ](https://safepiercing.org/jewelry-for-initial-piercings/) guide to learn more about proper jewelry. TL;DR - implant certified titanium is a good place to start for jewelry. You usually shouldn’t have a ring in a new piercing, it needs to be a post so it doesn’t move as much. Don’t try to change a new piercing yourself, use the link above to find a reputable piercer near you. \n\nIf you think you have a keloid, you likely don’t. Keloid is a word that is misused frequently in this community. Keloids are a condition that occur with any scar, including cuts and scrapes on the rest of your body. If your other scars heal normally and don’t develop an overgrowth, you are not someone who gets keloids. It’s somewhat rare and your irritation bump is almost never a keloid. \n\nTL;DR - if you have any issues with your piercing and don’t feel like doing the proper research yourself, find an APP informed piercer through [this](https://safepiercing.org/find-a-piercer/) link and go talk to them. \n\nAnything I missed? Comment below if you have any other questions or things I should add and I’ll try and get back to you/add it in.\n\nEDIT - minor typos. Thank you for the gold kind stranger!",

This is NOT ALL PIERCERS, but it is a lot of piercers. And usually when shops hire piercers there aren’t any requirements as far as training...because a lot of piercers start by piercing themselves and their friends, then sometimes they get pointers from a fellow piercer, but none of it is actual training.\n\nIf you have a piercing issue and can’t find a piercer with good information to give you, go see a dermatologist.\n\nSource: I’m a tattoo artist and have worked with A LOT of piercers over 17 years, but only 2 that were licensed by the APP.",

That didn't work (it got worse) so I started up with the spray again. Wasn't getting any better for several days, so I went ahead and got some sterile water. Did two rounds of rinsing after spraying in the morning and evening yesterday.\n\nLo and behold, today the bump has FINALLY shrunk! Rinsing it off so my skin doesn't get dry and flaky seems to be the magic formula. I had been rinsing in the shower but that wasn't doing it. Sterile water is the key for me. I put some in a brand-new disinfected NeilMed squeeze bottle (the kind used for sinus rinsing) and have been using that to rinse.

I suspect it's an irritation bump because, while I clean it rather enthusiastically, there isn't much discharge. I'm wondering if the irritation is from overcleaning or possibly from the metal? My piercer only offered surgical grade steel and because I've had ear piercings done by him in the past and experienced no problems, I just went with it. I do have an allergy to cheap metals, but i have no rash or itching around my nose piercing; just the swelling.\n\nMy cleaning regimen consists of wiping the outer and inner parts of the jewelry with a q-tip. I push the jewelry out as well, so that I can run the q-tip along the post. I then liberally spray both inside and out with the H2Ocean and let it air dry.

You won't get as close of a shave but it's worth it as your skin won't hate you.

    "body": " \n\nAs the culmination of a year of testing I am reviewing 33 mineral sunscreens! Here’s the YouTube review: [https://youtu.be/LUdhWWA7phE](https://youtu.be/LUdhWWA7phE) which I do recommend watching because I put in pictures of each sunscreen right after applying it and then 5 minutes after application to show how the whitecast dies down, or doesn’t. Also I’m giving away the winning sunscreen, and it’s an international giveaway! But if you can’t watch, here are the mini-reviews for each!\n\nI try to avoid drying alcohol and fragrance whenever possible, and I have extremely sensitive eyes, so that colors a lot of my reviews. I have combination skin (oily t-zone, especially in the summer, but my cheeks and chin are dry as hell) and I live in a very cold, dry climate (Northern Alberta). I’m white, but have intense olive undertones, and I tan like crazy and almost never burn. So that puts me at a Fitzpatrick type 4. Whitecast in sunscreens is a problem for me.\n\nHere’s the rules I used to pick sunscreens to test: \n\n1. mineral sunscreens only nothing that's primarily minerals with one chemical filter there's a lot of so-called mineral sunscreens that actually have octinoxate in them while my skin doesn't really have problems with chemical filters for a lot of people they can be incredibly irritating and cause breakouts redness rashes or exacerbate eczema so there'll be none of that in today's review \n2. These sunscreens have to contain at least some zinc oxide so that you can ensure that you're getting protection for the entirety of the uv range. Zinc is necessary to make sure you're protected from those long wave uva rays. Titanium dioxide just doesn't cover that part of the spectrum.\n3. The sunscreen has to have a uva rating. I am not here to trifle with shit when I don't know what kind of protection it's giving me. There are actually a couple of sunscreens on this list that don't have a proper uva rating but we'll get into that later (I was tricked!) Surprisingly, this did not exclude all North American sunscreens- a few North American companies do have proper uva ratings for their sunscreens so that's a pleasant change from my last sunscreen review.\n4. No tints there's no such thing as a truly universal tint for a mineral sunscreen that can make it blend into absolutely everybody's skin. \n5. No fragrance. It can be sensitizing and can trigger allergies even if you didn't previously have them. I try to avoid it whenever possible, especially in products that I use every day. \n\nMy standards of evaluation are mostly based on texture and whitecast. How much protection can a sunscreen offer you but still be wearable? Also, last year there was the sunscreen scandal: a bunch of sunscreens that had been made by the same company didn't actually have the same level of protection that they advertised, but this sort of scandal is not uncommon and also applies to a bunch of North American sunscreens too, so in order to keep myself from going crazy i just assume that the rating that \n\nthey state is the accurate rating unless proven otherwise. Some Korean sunscreen manufacturers have actually started providing their test results from independent labs which is great. I'll include what filters are in each sunscreen and whether or not they're nano-sized if the company made that information available. \n\nFinally, If two products are basically the same in terms of their performance the one that's cheaper will always win. \n\nOnward to the reviews!\n\n**THE WORST**\n\n***33) Elta MD UV Restore Broad Spectrum SPF 40/PA+++ Filters: ZnO (15%), TiO2 (2%)***  \nAfter my sunscreen review last year a lot of people requested that I look into Elta MD. It's a highly regarded brand making sunscreens for people with really sensitive skin and gets rave reviews everywhere. Now here's an interesting thing: most of their sunscreens, while they're primarily mineral based, usually do have at least one chemical filter in there, generally octinoxate. There's four Elta MD sunscreens in this review and they're all the mineral-only ones and they actually do uva testing for all their sunscreens- great! What could go wrong? Well. when a thing sets your face on fire that is generally a sign that things are going wrong. I have no idea who would have formulated this stupid piece of sunscreen because it is full of GINGER EXTRACT. Ginger is delicious, but if you bite into something and you're like oh that's got a bit of a kick to it you don't put it on your face! I immediately had to take it off because it burned and it burned and it burned like absolute hellfire which is of course the opposite of what you want from a mineral sunscreen. It's supposed to be soothing to your skin, not inflammatory. I don't get why some companies think that ginger is great for skin care- like yeah it can cause increased blood flow to your cheeks and give you that warm rosy glow of someone who's, you know, on fire. Just an absolute utter fail. What even were you thinking Elta MD, goddamn.\n\n***32) Isdin Fotoprotector Fusion Fluid Mineral SPF 50/UVA-PF 16.7 Filters: ZnO, TiO2***\n\nI had such high hopes for this because I've heard a lot about how Isdin, a company from Spain, makes absolutely great sunscreens. Unfortunately a lot of their products are fragranced or have a lot of alcohol in them but this one didn't have any of that! Iit should be great, right? Well, in addition to having a terrible whitecast, it burned my eyes. I have no idea how. It's a mineral sunscreen- the whole point of is to be good for sensitive skin and not cause burning sensations! Absolutely do not recommend, but it's not the complete worst because it only set fire to my eyes, not all of my skin, so there's that. \n\n***31) Ego Sunsense Sensitive Sun Lotion SPF 50+ / UVA-PF 20+ Filters: TiO2, ZnO***  \nThis gets the award for absolute worst whitecast. It made me look like I belonged on the Walking goddamn Dead. With some sunscreens the whitecast will continue to fade as the day goes on, but oh no not this. It stayed chalky white for 12 solid hours on my face. It's also drying- the problem with a lot of mineral sunscreens is they can be drying to the upper layers of your skin and enhance any dry or flaky patches you might have. This did all of that and so much more! You can just feel it sitting there on your skin because it's so heavy. This is everything wrong with mineral sunscreens in one convenient bottle!\n\n***30) Shiseido Wetforce Ultra Sun Protection Lotion SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO (19.3%), TiO2 (9.1%)***  \nOh this stuff… This is advertised as a sunscreen for sensitive skin that is also extremely water resistant if your skin gets wet- the wet force technology will more firmly adhere the sunscreen to your skin. Doesn't that sound crazy? It is so totally true and that is the worst part. This stuff has a ludicrous white cast, probably because of the insane amounts of both titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in it so I have no doubt about its protection value. The problem is that it’s impossible to get off of your skin. I had to get in the shower and use an oil cleanser \\*three times\\* to get this off of my body because of course when I try a sunscreen out I'll usually use it on my face, neck, chest, arms, and hands. I was half-covered in this stuff and it took me 30 minutes in the shower just to get clean again. I'm pretty sure that my cleavage is now a superfund site that will be leaking titanium dioxide for the next 500 years. I guess this could be worthwhile if you've got kids and you want to take them out to the beach or the pool, this will ensure that the sunscreen stays on them the whole day, and probably the next day, and the day after that. That's the only circumstances under which I could see anyone actually wanting this stuff to contact their skin.\n\n***29) Ombrelle Face Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50/UVA-PF ?? Filters: TiO2 (9%), ZnO (7%)***  \nThis sunscreen does not have a proper uva rating- I foolishly assumed that it did because it's from Ombrelle and literally every other sunscreen that they make has a uva rating. It's all got the uva circle on it which is a European thing showing that the sunscreen's uva protection is at least one-third of the stated SPF (the uvb protection). But no, not for this one. It's also primarily titanium dioxide with some zinc and the white cast is absolutely egregious. It's disgusting in all the ways mineral sunscreens can be disgusting. It smelled kind of… off and was intensely dehydrating to my skin. \n\n***28) Ultrasun Mineral Body Sunscreen SPF 50/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2 (all nano)***  \nIn my last review I tried an Ultrasun product for the face that sucked and one for the body that was infinitely superior and also cost half the price and got you twice the product. I was kind of hoping that would happen this time… it did not happen. It is admittedly by price per milliliter cheaper than their mineral sunscreen for the face and that is the only good thing i have to say about it because the pump is broken! It has a pump which at first I was like oh that's gonna be great- the problem is the sunscreen is so thick and chalky that the pump just cannot handle it. The sunscreen's gravitational pull just sucked the tube right down to the bottom so if you're gonna try and use this you have to squeeze out a thick brontosaurus turd of it and go from there. It's so, so thick you can just feel it sitting on your skin like a 900 pound gorilla. The white cast is actually not bad when it dries down, but you can still feel it there and that's if you can work with this at all. It's very hard to spread out on your skin and took me like a solid three minutes of rubbing before I could get it to properly adhere to my skin at all. This is the kind of sunscreen that gets all cut up in your hair because it's almost impossible to massage it in fully. So much for that Swiss engineering, huh? \n\n***27) Ultrassun Mineral Face Sunscreen SPF 50/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2 (all nano)***  \nFirst of all, this is a sunscreen for ants (what I call any sunscreen that's 40 milliliters or less). It promises ultra-light protection for the face and while this and the previous sunscreen do have a little bit of alcohol in them it's not very high on the ingredients list and I did not find that to irritate my skin. What was irritating to my skin was these disgusting crusty bits that form when you put it on your face. I wouldn't even call it pilling it's something far worse than that. IT’S CRUSTY, Y’ALL. Once it's dried down the white cast isn't terrible but I just could not tolerate the feel of this on my skin- it's gross when you're trying to rub it in and you feel these horrible little things everywhere… No. Just no. \n\n**THE BAD**\n\n***26) Avene Very High Protection Mineral Fluid SPF 50/UVA-PF16.7 Filters: ZnO, TiO2 (all nano)***\n\nI had kind of assumed that since this was a fluid with a more milky texture that it would have less whitecast and absorb better into the skin. I was wrong. I was very wrong- it has a terrible whitecast. It's also slightly dehydrating and it's kind of pricey especially considering it's a sunscreen for ants at 40 milliliters. Do not want. \n\n***25) Primera Skin Relief Sun Milk SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nI had very high expectations for this one because Primera is a high-end brand. Their miracle seed lotus essence is a cult favorite product and things that I've tried from them in the past were very nice and very luxurious. Even this sunscreen was kind of deceptive in that it's white cast isn't terrible and it's a very milky runny lotion. I thought “oh wow this is nice despite how incredibly expensive it is” but then as i wore it throughout the day these oily pools of it would bubble up on my skin out of nowhere making the white cast worse as I wore it and turning my skin into an oil slick. How? How does that even happen? I don't know but I don't ever want to try it again. What an expensive failure. \n\n***24) Bonajour Witch Hazel No Sebum Sunshield SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nI was so excited about this because it promises to be a mattifying but not dehydrating sunscreen, and those are quite rare and especially good for people who have oily or combination skin. Yeah, it was not to be. I will say the texture on this is quite nice and the white cast dies down to next to nothing. It is a sunscreen for ants, but that's not the worst thing on earth because it's not that expensive. So why is it down in the bad? BECAUSE IT’S GOT FUCKING ORANGE OIL IN IT.  I admit I should have been scanning the ingredients list more closely but in a sunscreen advertised as not having any artificial fragrance or any sensitizing ingredients I’d kind of assumed would not have citrus oil. I was gonna give this a bad rating just based on principle. Citrus oils contain chemical compounds called furanocoumarins that react to UV light by killing your skin cells in such a way that it lets the sun right into deeper layers and will give you melanoma. Why would you put that into sunscreen? That's the stupidest shit i've ever seen and I was raised a young earth creationist. Do better, Bonajour! \n\n***23) Make:Prem Defense Me Calming Sun Cream SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO (non-nano)***  \nThis has a beautiful texture- it's a very watery cream so it feels light on the skin, but it's also moisturizing without being oily. It is pretty dewy but not too much so to where you start to look sweaty. It's a zinc-only sunscreen with minimal white cast after a few minutes. Why is it here in the bad? Well, this is advertised as something that's very safe for sensitive skin and isn't going to cause any irritation… and it is full of fragrance that isn’t advertised as fragrance. This is another tricksy sunscreen that tries to pretend like it doesn't have fragrant ingredients but is full of rose flower water and jasmine flower water This isn't going to be as potentially irritating as say, something that's full of the essential oils from those flowers, but flower waters (or hydrosols as they're sometimes called) are still full of fragrance and the particles that make it smell so good can be extremely irritating to your skin. Especially if your skin is sensitive and you're the sort of person who would be looking for a product for sensitive skin- which this advertises itself as. I missed all of that because usually when I'm just looking at the ingredients list I'm looking for something that says fragrance essential oils. I didn't catch it and that's on me, but if you have sensitive skin now you know and knowing is half the battle… the other half is violence. \n\n**THE MEH**\n\n***22) 2e UV Sunscreen SPF 45/PA++++  Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nThis is only an SPF 45, though it does have four PA pluses, so a uva protection factor of at least 16. However, it's a sunscreen for ants and the white cast is just terrible. I've been curious about this brand and my first experience did not impress me. I guess on the plus side since there wasn't very much of it I didn't have to endure it for all that long in my life but that's literally the only good thing I can say about it. It didn't injure my skin or dry me out too badly, but man that white cast is just a no-go. There's going to be  a run of products here in this section that are just really stunningly mediocre Japanese sunscreens but don't worry! Things do get better.\n\n***21) &Free Whitening UV Cream SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nAnother sunscreen for ants, and while the white cast isn't terrible it smells like Corn Nuts! I looked at the ingredients list and I cannot tell you what on earth would make it smell that way, but it is noticeably like Corn Nuts which meant that every time I tried to put  it on my face I was mildly repulsed. I guess there are some people who really like the smell of Corn Nuts, but  I am not one of them, and for that reason alone this would be in the Meh section, but also you only get 30 milliliters of it and it's a bit pricey for what you get. I did not notice any serious benefits re: whitening or helping fade my hyperpigmentation, but then again I don't know how I would with only 30 milliliters. You'd probably have to buy several bottles to see any actual improvements and then you'd have to deal with all of the Corn Nuts, so no thank you, &Free. \n\n***20) Ihada Medicated UV Screen SPF 50+/PA+++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nI had really high hopes about this one because it's another medicated quasi-drug from Japan, meaning it's got some medicinal ingredients in it. The ingredient in question is a really potent form of licorice extract, which is so good for the skin- a lot of people have heard about it because it's good for fading hyperpigmentation, but it's also incredibly soothing and good for healing your skin from irritation and obviously in a mineral sunscreen that'd be great, right? But the white cast, oh the white cast. It’s not great and I could feel this sunscreen sitting on my skin the whole day. I don't like to be extra conscious of my flesh when I'm just trying to do my thing and so it was very much a disappointment. There’s 50 milliliters of it though, so it's not a sunscreen for ants. I didn't notice any healing or soothing, but that may be because I couldn't get over the feel of it on my skin.\n\n***19) Kose SunCut Pro Defense Non-Chemical UV Sunscreen Milk SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nYou get a goodly amount of this- 60 milliliters, but much like the Ihada I found the whitecast to be disappointing and it just sat heavily on my skin and was lightly dehydrating. I'm sorry Kose, but this was just kind of okay. Better than the Ihada because you get more and there’s an extra PA+, though.\n\n***18) Uriage Bariesun Mineral Cream SPF 50+/UVA-PF 20 Filters: ZnO, TiO2 (nano)***  \nThis was… almost good. You get a ton of the stuff- 100 milliliters! So it's not very expensive when it comes to price per milliliter. The protection is high, it's got that uva circle, and it's really nice and moisturizing but not greasy. So what's the problem? The whitecast- it starts off terrible, and while it gets a little better it doesn't improve nearly enough for me to give this a good rating. I will say this sits pretty well under makeup, so if you wear makeup every day you might not care about the zombiecast because it is very nice and very moisturizing, but don't worry I've got nice moisturizing and inexpensive sunscreens coming up that don't have this level of white cast!\n\n***17) Elta MD UV Replenish Broad Spectrum SPF 44/PA+++ Filters: ZnO (10%), TiO2 (5.5%)***  \nThe second entry from Elta MD, this is a big improvement over the previous entry as it did not burn my skin or my eyes. There’s no shady extracts lurking in it, it’s water resistant up to 40 minutes, and it's a little bit moisturizing but… it's whitecast-y, kind of chalky and just not great. Better- absolutely a whole lot better- but it really is just okay. \n\n***16) Avene Solaire UV Mineral Multi-Defense Sunscreen SPF 50+/UVA-PF?? Filters: ZnO (12%)***  \nThis is lightly moisturizing but not greasy. It's got minimal white cast and a whole 50 milliliters and I absolutely love the packaging (I love upside down squeezy tubes). Why did I not give it a good rating? because it does not have a proper uva rating and I was legitimately tricked. The photo of the product from the website has the uva circle on it but the actual product does not BEAUTYHABIT.COM YOU FUCKING LIED TO ME. Which is especially weird, because I went and checked out the Avene website in the US where this is sold, because obviously if it was sold in Europe it would have a uva rating. The official website does not lie- it has a picture of the product that matches the real thing. So I'm like, did beautyhabit.com make their own picture of this to deliberately deceive people into thinking that it had a uva rating?  I have absolutely no idea where that picture would have come from otherwise. It clearly had to be modified from the original. It's a groovy mystery but if you don't mind not knowing what the actual uva protection of your sunscreen is you would probably like this a lot because it is really nice aside from the smell, which I can best liken to “pickle-flavoured scratch-n-sniff sticker I got in a grade school book fair.”  As per the rules I gotta have a uva rating so this gets bumped all the way out of the good and down into the meh, which is really too bad. But the law is the law! \n\n**THE GOOD**\n\n***15) Skin+Lab Barrierderm Daily Sunscreen SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nThis is really, really nice. It's kind of a sunscreen for ants as it's only got 45 milliliters, but it's full of ceramides and if you have a damaged skin barrier it's really really good at healing and moisturizing. I found it very pleasant in terms of its texture and the whitecast is minimal to non-existent. So why doesn't it have a better rating? Well, because as far as I can tell you can't get your hands on this stuff for love nor money. I'm not sure if it's been discontinued or if this is just a covid thing (supply chain issues) but you can't buy it anywhere and that's really too bad because I genuinely liked this a lot. Bring it back Skin+Lab, and in a larger size huh? I’ll give you much better reading! Ah like they care. \n\n***14) Heliocare 360 Mineral Tolerance Fluid SPF 50/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2 (all nano)***  \nThis is my one slip up in terms of sunscreens with tints. It did not advertise itself as such- you have to look at the ingredients list and notice that there's iron oxides on there, and when I'm looking at ingredients lists I'm mostly looking for things like fragrance and essential oils. It's actually very nice in terms of its texture and because it does have a tint it blended into my skin beautifully and did not exhibit any white cast. However, the tint is clearly not universal and in photos you can see how the tint is weirdly… separating out from the rest of the sunscreen, so I don't think this would look good on anybody with skin darker than mine. If they were to come out with a whole range of tints for this I'd consider recommending it but since they don't I won't. It's also quite pricey. \n\n***13) Elta MD UV Active Full Body Sunscreen SPF 50/PA++++ Filters: ZnO (19%), TiO2 (4%)***  \nThis is a bit of a weird one because the white cast is not bad, but it's not great either. What sets this one apart is that it is very water resistant- up to 80 minutes. It's got a PA of four plus, so great uva protection, and while it is pretty great for heavy-duty outdoor activities (I did actually test that during the summer time) and it didn't sweat off, it actually rinses away pretty easily with a proper cleansing oil unlike the thrice-cursed Shiseido Wetforce. As far as an athletic sunscreen goes, this is pretty good but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for every day as it's very thick and it takes some effort to work it into your skin. It smells good- like oatmeal cookies, but I don't know why. It doesn't have colloidal oatmeal in it or any added fragrance, but with the scent and the thicker texture it's sort of like you're rubbing oatmeal cookie dough onto your face which I found to be oddly luxurious. Not enough to want to wear it every day though. \n\n***12) CoTZ Face Prime and Protect Non-Tinted Sunscreen SPF 40/PA++++ Filters: TiO2 (8%), ZnO (3.8%)***   \nThis also comes in a tinted version but not a range of tints so I went for the untinted version. It’s another rarity in terms of North American sunscreens that do have a PA rating and it's got a PA of 4 plus, so pretty darn good. This is a very minimalist sunscreen brand- CoTZ stands for: Contains Only Titanium dioxide and Zinc oxide. Aside from that it's got quite a few silicones in it but a very short ingredients list overall. No botanical extracts that could potentially irritate sensitive skin or anything like that. It's also more of a titanium dioxide sunscreen with less zinc, and I will say, for that type of sunscreen it has a bonkers low level of white cast. But it still does have a white cast, which is why I didn't rate it all that highly. As a primer under makeup it is quite good if you like silicon-heavy primers. It did an incredible job at filling in the large pores around my nose. If your skin is sensitive and you want a little extra protection under your makeup, put this on top of a sunscreen that you're already wearing to fill in pores and give your skin a nice satin-matte finish because otherwise it's a sunscreen for ants at only 40 milliliters and it is a bit pricey for what you get. As an everyday sunscreen, it’s so-so, but as a primer under makeup it’s awesome. \n\n***11) Benton Mineral Sun Cream SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nThis is a really really nice sunscreen- it’s got minimal white cast and it's so moisturizing, very much a watery cream. You put it on and it feels like bursts of moisture all over the skin. That aspect of it was an absolute delight. What I just couldn't get over was the fact that it smells sweet in a weird generic way…  far too similar to toilet bowl cleaner, which is not really what I want to be putting on my face every day.  It's also got some botanical extracts that could be irritating to some peoples’ skin, and since mineral sunscreens are generally geared towards people with more sensitive skin I’d steer clear. So for those reasons, it's down towards the bottom end of the good, but it is still good and if it didn't smell like toilet bowl cleaner I would have probably enjoyed it a lot more. \n\n***10) Coppertone Protection UV Plus SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nThis is a Japanese sunscreen that is very light on the skin. You really don't feel it on your skin at all, which is fantastic. The problem is that you can \\*kind of\\* see it on your skin but it's one of those sunscreens where the white cast is only visible when you're turning your head and there's this kind of bluish sheen on the high points of your face, so I guess if you're going for a goth highlight it could work. Otherwise, it's very nice. It’s lightly moisturizing, but not so much that it becomes greasy. The issues are the light whitecast and the fact that it’s a sunscreen for ants at only 40 milliliters. And while it’s reasonably priced, it’s not nearly cheap enough to make that truly feasible for me.\n\n***9) Ma:nyo Our Vegan Cica Daily Sun Cream SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***This brand used to be called Manyo Factory, and as part of their rebranding, they revamped a lot of their packaging and some of their products. This sunscreen is part of a whole line of new sunscreens that they have and I really liked it. It's another watery cream with minimal whitecast and an absolutely beautiful texture to it. Smells like tea tree oil, probably because it has tea tree oil in it. I don't have any problems with tea tree oil and while it can be beneficial to your skin if you have acne, it’s irritating to some people, especially with sensitive skin. That's part of why it's got a lower rating, and the other is the price- this is expensive. It is 50 milliliters, but it's quite pricey and can be hard to find. It's a really solid product but I just wish it was more readily available and at a lower price.\n\n***8) Dr. G Mild Up Sun+ SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO***  \nThis is a reformulation of an older product, and it's lovely. It’s a zinc oxide-only sunscreen which means it has a pretty minimal white cast, like a teeny tiny bit but only if you look closely. The texture is another one of those really beautiful light, watery moisturizing-but-not-greasy mineral sunscreens. It's also reasonably priced at $20 US for 50 milliliters. It's pretty easy to get your hands on and just a really all-around nice sunscreen. If you want something that's going to be kind to your skin and isn't going to have a terrible whitecast and is lightly moisturizing, this is a good choice. \n\n***7) Suntique I'm Pure Cica Suncream SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nThis was a delight- it's got pretty much no whitecast, has a beautifully light texture and it's one of the least whitecast-y sunscreens on here. The only downside there is that it smells a little weird, not so much that I didn't enjoy using it though, and it is kind of pricey for 50 milliliters but otherwise it's just very, very good. \n\n**THE GREAT**\n\n***6) Elta MD UV Pure Face and Body SPF 47/PA++++  Filters: ZnO (10%), TiO2 (5.5%)***  \nThis is a sunscreen designed for heavier outdoor activity. It's water resistant for up to 80 minutes which I did test by actually going out in the hot sun and moving my body around which, barf. It does not sweat off but at the same time it doesn't require a fire hose to blast it off of your face at the end of the day. It’s also not nearly as thick as the Elta MD SPF 50. It spreads more easily, has less white cast and is just lighter in texture in general. This is the perfect compromise between a heavy duty mineral outdoor sunscreen and an everyday facial sunscreen. I really enjoyed this. If you have sensitive skin and you do a lot of stuff out in the sun I highly, \\*highly\\* recommend this, but it's also not bad as just an everyday sunscreen. It's also got a PA of 4-plus so, great uva protection. Well done, Elta MD. I am gratified that all those rave reviews were not wrong. \n\n5) Axis-y Complete No Stress Physical Sunscreen SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2  \nI fell in love with this sunscreen and clearly I’m not alone in my feelings. I had to try a mini size that I purchased as part of a little starter kit that Axis-Y makes with mini versions of a lot of their products, because for months you could not get your hands on the full-sized bottle of this stuff. That's how popular it is. It sold out like crazy and only in November 2021 were they finally able to restock it, and I can completely see why. It's light, it's moisturizing but it's not greasy, and it has absolutely minimal whitecast It's very gentle on the skin, and feels delightful. It's just all around great and not too expensive. \n\n***4) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Natural Suncream SPF 50/PA++++ Filters: ZnO***   \nThis sunscreen almost did not get reviewed by me because multiple websites are printing the wrong ingredients list for it! I think there's been a copy and paste error somewhere because multiple websites that I looked at have the same ingredients list as one of Isntree’s other sunscreens: the Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel, but this is soooo much better than that one. I did not like that sunscreen- it’s got homosalate in it and burned the shit out of my eyes. This is like a greatly improved, mineral-only version of that sunscreen. It has really nice packaging, but more importantly it's zinc oxide only and has a minimal to non-existent white cast after it dries down. It's got \\*such\\* a nice texture, very light, almost weightless on the skin but deeply hydrating. If you are at all struggling with dry, irritated skin this is going to be pretty helpful. It's also got a bunch of really nice, soothing ingredients in an otherwise fairly short ingredients list. It's got this kind of… smoothing factor to it and genuinely makes my pores look smaller and kind of blurred. It sits beautifully under makeup. A total winner when it comes to something for people with sensitive skin. If you need healing and you want to blur out skin texture I really recommend this one. Isntree, please be more vigilant about your ingredients lists! Otherwise i would never have known this was a mineral sunscreen, wouldn't have bought it and oh my life would be so much poorer for that. \n\n***3) Be Plain Clean Ocean Non-Nano Mild Suncream SPF 50+/PA++++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2 (all non-nano)***  \nThis sunscreen is a lot like several of the previous entries: it's a Korean sunscreen that has both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in it, has next to no white cast a lovely texture that smooths over your skin and manages to be moisturizing but not greasy. So what makes this one so special? The independent testing that verified the SPF and the PA rating. This sunscreen was found to have an SPF of just over 50 and a PA rating of just over 16, so you know exactly what you’re getting. Not to sound like an ad from a clothing store from the early part of 2020, but in these \\*unprecedented\\* times couldn't we all use a little more certainty? Yes, yes we could. I absolutely love this sunscreen- my only nitpicks are that it's a little bit harder to find and it can be pricey depending on where you buy it, but you get a full 50 milliliters so it's not a sunscreen for ants and it is absolutely worth the money. Win! \n\n***2) Cyberderm Simply Zinc Light Untinted Sunscreen SPF 50/UVA-PF 20 Filters: ZnO (25%)***  \nThis is an absolute miracle of a product. Cyberderm is a brand from Canadian company (The Sunscreen Company, not a very original name, lol) that makes Venus Williams's mineral sunscreens that you may have seen if you live in the US. Venus Williams is a dark-skinned black woman who has sensitive skin and she wanted a mineral sunscreen that wouldn't make her look ashy and undead. So she got in touch with the Sunscreen Company and they made her some cast-less mineral sunscreens. The reason I didn't review any of those is because they don't have a uva rating (sold in the US) and they're also expensive as hell. The Cyberderm sunscreen is also pricey but you get a full 100 milliliters of it, and wow it’s amazing. This is \\*25 percent\\* zinc oxide and yet it manages to have pretty much no whitecast. I don't know how they did it but they did. It's incredible. It also has a uva protection factor of 20 which is about the highest you can get in a mineral sunscreen and have it still be wearable. It is a fairly light texture and smells a little bit like yogurt- that may or may not be a bad thing as far as you're concerned. I liked it. The only real caveat here is that you do absolutely have to use it up like it's antibiotics so you can't let this sit on your shelf for like four to six months and expect it to have a good texture when you come back. It'll still look really nice but it starts to feel gritty and gross so just buy this and use it consistently instead of bouncing from sunscreen to sunscreen the way I did when I was testing things, lol. Ohhhhh Canada! \n\n**THE BEST**\n\n***1) Biore UV Kids Pure Milk SPF 50/PA+++ Filters: ZnO, TiO2***  \nThis was a complete dark horse upset victory. I was not in any way prepared for this sunscreen. If you saw my mega-review of sunscreens from last year you'll know how much I lamented the discontinuation of the original Biore Kids UV Milk- it was a chemical-only sunscreen and it was being replaced with an all-mineral filter sunscreen that had a lower PA rating and I was so sad. I assumed that this impostor sunscreen was gonna suck and suck hard, and no it won. The sunscreen that I had thought I was going to hate is the one that I just couldn't keep from coming back to, over and over again What makes it so good? It is \\*whisper\\* light on the skin. You barely feel it when you're putting it on, much less when you're wearing it throughout the day. It's also water, sweat, sand (lack of stickiness), and abrasion resistant because it's meant for little kids when you're going to the beach. It's incredibly gentle on the skin and has that wonderful smoothing effect that blurs your pores a bit and overall just gives a lovely satin-matte finish. You get a ton of it- 70 milliliters- and it's dirt cheap. I bought it on Amazon Japan and paid like, 5 bucks for it. And practical concerns aside, it just has that… \\*something.\\* It sparks joy. Yes, the PA rating is a three-plus instead of a four-plus, but honestly, I did not care- that's how much I like this sunscreen. One of the cool things about taking all these photos of different sunscreens on my skin is that I can actually see how my hyperpigmentation continued to fade over the time I was using them, so they all “work,” so to speak, and the PA rating did not affect the performance of this sunscreen. When it's this easy to wear, it's also easier to reapply. I've said many times in my videos, the best sunscreen is the one that you'll actually wear every day and my god did I love wearing this. And so, for all of those reasons this is the number one all-mineral sunscreen! You made me love you, Biore UV Kids Pure Milk, but I didn't want to do it! \n\nWhich, of course means that in the giveaway you're gonna get your very own Biore UV Kids’ Pure Milk! God, this stuff is so great I’m so excited to be giving it away. To win it, you just have to subscribe to my channel and leave a comment with the hashtag #rockmyface (since mineral sunscreens are made from white rocks).\n\nThanks so much for reading, I hope these reviews help if you’re looking for a new sunscreen!",

BUT this faded away for me (waited around 10-20 mins)! I put around 3-4 dribbles on my face, so I think I used a lot 😅\nEDIT in full bright light there was still white cast 🥲\n\n- it will highlight all your dry skin zones. I have a lot of dry skin on the bottom half of my face from tret, and it caught alllll of this sunscreen so I look flaky af 😂 \n\n- it worked well with my Neutrogena hydro boost water gel, but NOT with my azelaic acid cream. I applied the sunscreen 2-3 hours after the AA cream and hydro boost - no pilling/white gunk with the hydro boost, but definitely a lot with the AA cream :)\n\nAll in all, this is still the best sunscreen I've ever used in my life. OP was so right on this one 😻😻\n\nWill update this comment with how I go reapplying after a few hours!",

    "body": "I'm getting sick of this constant misinformation that a bump on a piercing is a keloid, and even sicker of the suggestions that it can be treated with tea tree oil, aspirin paste, peroxide, etc. \n\nThis kind of shit caused me to lose a couple piercings when I was young and dumb and new to piercings, and to see it circulating even in this sub where there actually IS good info and knowledge is frustrating. I feel like I've been seeing it a LOT more than usual recently (probably due to more advice being asked here due to piercing shops being closed) and figured a blanket response would be useful.\n\nKeloids are a genetic scarring condition, are permanent, and those who are predisposed to them definitely know that they are because they've experienced it before. A bump on a piercing is almost never a keloid. It is an irritation bump.\n\n(Side note: yeah infection can also happen but it's much likely to be nastier than just a bump. If it's hot to the touch, has smelly discharge, is throbbing, and you feel feverish, see a doctor.)\n\nWhat causes irritation? Many things. There's a great post here that has a lot of good info on what to do: /r/piercing/comments/dlij72/help_my_piercing_looks_irritatedredi_have_a/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nI honestly don't know why the above isn't pinned yet. It should be. But it's info clearly needs to be reiterated. Disclaimer: IANAP, but I've got years of experience with piercings and advice from professional piercers I trust as well as from this sub. All of what I'm about to say is universally acknowledged as good advice.\n\nThe primary causes of irritation bumps are:\n\n-Wrong jewelry. This can be wrong length, wrong gauge, wrong type (hoop vs. labret vs. curved barbell), or wrong metal.  When in doubt, change to titanium jewelry of the best type for your piercing (usually not a hoop since they move around the most) in a proper length that's fitted but not too snug or too long, and the gauge at which you were pierced. Anything else can cause irritation.\n\n-Cleaning routine. Use sterile saline spray/wound wash, perhaps with a rinse afterward. No twisting, no rubbing with Q-tips, no picking off crusties, no irritating cleaners (this includes antibacterial soap and tea tree oil. Just don't. Seriously.)\n\n-External factors. Picking at it? Don't. Sleeping on it? Don't. Did it get snagged? It'll take awhile to calm down. Don't mess with it. When in doubt, LITHA (leave it the hell alone)\n\n-Changing too early. Healing timeframes are guidelines and everyone is different. Listen to your body. If your piercing really hurts when trying to change it, don't. If it develops a bump afterward, change back to your initial jewelry and don't try again for several weeks. Body piercings take time to heal and if you're not willing to be patient enough to wait until the latest given estimate on healing time, you shouldn't get pierced. When in doubt, wait.\n\nIf you've taken care of all of the above, and your bump doesn't seem to be going away, give it time and follow the advice in the other post. \n\nI hope all this helps. Ultimately, I just don't wanna see anyone giving themselves chemical burns or ruining their piercings because of bad info. Don't make my mistakes and please for the love of God, don't perpetuate bad advice.\n\n\nEDITED TO ADD: u/Imastealth pointed out that I forgot to address angle! The angle at which you are pierced is SUPER important and can absolutely cause bumps. Unless your piercing is visibly wonky though, this can be tricky to diagnose. If you've tried all of the above and bumps persist or recur a lot (we're talking like a year or more and it still isn't healing) find a reputable piercer and get a second opinion on the angle of your piercing. I've had this happen to me and had to get re-pierced. Sometimes an angle can SEEM fine but your body just doesn't like it. But again: see a reputable piercer.",

READ IT. \n\nI will add, if you are worried about your piercing, contact a REPUTABLE PIERCER- preferably an APP certified piercer that can be found here: https://www.memberleap.com/members/directory/search_bootstrap.php?org_id=AOPP\n\nImportant take aways and additions:\n\n-LITHA outside of cleaning with STERILE SALINE SOLUTION. NeilMed is one example of said solution. Do not use QTIPS. \n\n-Internally threaded jewelry is ALWAYS best. \n\n-Gold, Titanium, AND Niobium are quality metals. \n\n-BLACK JEWELRY IS TYPICALLY A PVD (physical vapor deposition) COATING and is usually NO GOOD FOR FRESH OR HEALED PIERCINGS. \n\n-DO NOT CHANGE IT OUT BEFORE IT IS HEALED. In fact, best practice is to have a reputable piercer swap your jewelry out. Typically we will do this at no cost. \n\n-If you aren’t sure, contact a local reputable piercer. \n\n-LITHA LITHA LITHA!\n\nEdit: \nBumps, swelling, redness, tenderness, and clear lymph discharge are NORMAL for fresh piercings. If it is hot to the touch, very angry, or discharge is green/yellow it is best to see a health professional as antibiotics may be required. If your piercing is deemed “infected” please do not take the jewelry out as this can trap the infection and cause further problems. Please always see a reputable piercer or healthcare professional if you become worried.",

Once a day simply spray some directly on your piercing, let it sit for a minute or two and then dry with non woven gauze.     A few minutes before your daily shower, spray again. At the end of your shower, rinse the piercing well. Make sure to not let the waterspray hit the piercing directly. Then use the tip or edge of a piece of non woven gauze to soak up any moisture and carefully wipe away softened gunk and dry your piercing. Keep (wet) hair away from your piercings. Other then that keep the piercing dry and exposed to the air. Leave any blood, crusties etc. that didn’t come off during your shower be. They’ll come off during your next shower or the one after that. Do not touch, move, fiddle or disturb the jewelry in any way.

    "body": "This all happened 2 days ago, but I decided to post it here anyway.\n\nI (M18), was at my grandparents place for a weekend. I had been dealing with some minor gum issues and had notified my grandma about it, as I knew she had battled gum issues in the past. She gave me a bottle of pure tea tree oil, suggested 3 drops in 150ml of water to rinse and spit out. IMPORTANTLY: SPIT OUT. \n\nI told her that I dont really taste anything so she told me to try 10 drops. After rinsing and spitting out, she decided to let me take the bottle home. The following night at home, I was doing the rinse and spit, when I got the clever thought that \"Oh! Since its tea tree, safe to use for your mouth, (or so I thought), Im sure there are some health benefits of swallowing it\".\n\nI ended up drinking 10 drops of pure tea tree oil dilluded with just 150ml of water, with the idea that it was a good idea cause I am a very dehydrated person anyway.\n\nIn bed, right before putting the phone down, I decided to look up tea tree oil to see how healthy my choice had been. Upon googling it, I was told to rush to the hospital immediately.\n\nAfter walking to the hospital (its a 5 or 6 minute walk) I ended up being strapped down in a chair and being poked with needles. Then they rolled the chair in the back of an ambulance and we were headed for the city. They checked my blood pressure, heart rate and regularity, and blood sugar levels, all of which they said were textbook perfect.\n\nI was made to stay in a crowded fluorescent hospital hallway for 6 hours from 1-7am, and then I had to wait in a car for 30 minutes as we drove back to town where I could finally catch 5 hours of probably the worst sleep of my life. I luckily walked off fine though, with no lasting symptoms or anything. \n\nAlso, concerning little extra. Some of my doctors had to use chatgtp to understand what tea tree oil was.\n\n\nTL;DR, drank 10 drops pure tea tree oil and ended up in the hospital. \n\nEDIT: \nTo those who said going to the hospital was uneccesary - I had already called poison control and informed them. They urged me to seek medical attention immediately. \n\nAlso, a lot of people are wondering why I didn't do my research. I usually do, but I didn't this time around. My grandmother is a well renowned gardener, and so I trusted her very well with what she was giving me. I did not think to do my own research at that time, and it was an honest mistake. We live, and we learn, and I certainly will not be putting essential oils anywhere near mouth again. \n\nEDIT 2:\nI know it's not grandma's fault. Thank you guys for correcting me on my blame shifting behavior. I'm not and wasn't ever mad at her for what happened. I've fully known this whole time that the fault is mine. Im just trying to look less like a dumbass. \n\nEDIT 3: \nJust removed some stuff that I regretted saying, cause I felt it didn't represent how I felt about the situation accurately. ",

    "body": "Warning this will be a long post, it has everything I've learnt in the past couple of years from hair growth, to styling, to weightloss, to nervous system regulation and more.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, I have 3B hair, tall, two years ago I was obese, prediabetic, I had anxiety problems, now I'm just a tall \\[seemingly ;) \\] effortlessly pretty black girl and I want all my beauties on here to have my beauty secrets.\n\nTopics discussed:\n\n* Haircare\n* Style\n* Makeup \n* Teeth\n* Skincare\n* Weight loss vs Fat loss\n* Healthy Fat loss\n* Body Recomposition \n* Inflammation\n* Gut Health\n* How to lower androgen/testosterone levels\n* Nervous System Regulation/Stress Management \n* Tea Cycling\n* Seed Cycling \n\n# Hair\n\nI have PCOS so it affects my hair growth and causes hirsutism, basically male patterened facial hair and male patterned baldness.\n\n**Hair Growth:** Here is the true secret sauce to hair growth, stimulating your scalp. I do daily scalp massages with a bamboo brush (even the bristles are made of rounded bamboo) very gentle. This is the one I use: [Golab Beauty](https://golabbeauty.com/products/organic-bamboo-scalp-massager-hair-brush)  I do short strokes which prevents any tangles. Morning and Night. I then go in with a scalp serum, I use The Oui scalp serum but it costs a pretty penny. In the first yearish I used (The 'Ordinary' Haircare Growth Set Multi-Peptide Serum For Hair Density) which worked wonders and was cost effective. At nights I seal with any scalp oil that has rosemary oil. Sadly Mielle's formula no longer works for me, but As I Am rosemary oil has been working, I also like the Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Hair and Scalp Drops. For Washing my hair I suffer from sebaceous dermatitis which causes scaliness. Paradoxically my scalp is so oily which is what triggers the ezcema and develops the dry patches. Reversing my PCOS symptoms fixed this but what also helped was the Nizoral shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole. It's harsh so I do it once to twice a month at most and I always follow up with a moisturizing shampoo, and of course finish with a wash out conditioner & leave in conditioner.\n\n**Hair Retention:** This is the info we all know about preventing breakage but I'll include just in case. Hair growth happens in the scalp like said before but to retain that growth it's important to wear protective hairstyles (especially while asleep), a silk/satin bonnet or wrap, silk/satin pillowcase, do not let your hair air dry at night. There is debate about this but I've seen hair specialists and scientists say our hair is especially fragile when wet (especially curly/kinky hair). Therefore, we are much more prone to snags and breakage while our hair is wet. So going to bed make sure your hair is dried. If you're air drying your hair during the day try not to touch it too much  - as little manipulation as possible. Personally choose to diffuse/blow dry my hair and this has prevented most of the breakage I was previously experiencing. Lastly, moisturize and oil your ends. I won't pretend like I know which order is best or even if it's important but I've found that using hair moisturizer/diluted leave in conditioner then hair oil works best for me.\n\n**Hirsutism/Facial Hair:** Spearmint essential oil. I add 1-2 drops of the oil to my moisturizer each time I put on my moisturizer and it helped A LOT with reducing my facial hair. I also drink a lot of spearmint tea. Spearmint specifically has been proven to lower androgen/testosterone levels which is why it helps. I also took supplements which I'll include at the end because they served multiple purposes. Be sure not to add the oil to the entire bottle because that will ruin your moisturizer's formula. Just add the drops in your palm/finger tips and mix in your face cream each time you moisturize your jawline, chin, underneck. Also, do this after moisturizing the upper part of your face without the oil because it's harsh and the scent can be irritating to your eye area.\n\n**Body hair:** Personally I sugar wax my arms and legs, the hair has grown back so thin now. I make it myself and follow tutorials from abetweene on youtube.\n\n**Hair colour/Hairstyle:** This will depend on your face shape and color season. I'm a dark winter colour season and I have a heart face shape. I used the Dressika app to discover my color season before I could afford to get myself professionally assessed and I got the same results. Just be sure to use natural lighting, like by a window. Once you have your colour season you can choose hair colours that work best for you (although natural almost always works best). For my hairstyle I try to choose styles that compliment my heart shaped face. I used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with figuring this out.\n\n# Style\n\nI think most of us know about **Kibbe and colour seasons.** This was how I upgraded my wardrobe. I'm a soft dramatic so I wear things that work for my tall height and accentuate my waist.\n\nThis was the game changer with colour seasons. Most of us know about our true seasons, but it can get restrictive. Sister seasons and colour dissonance is also helpful to know.\n\nMy colour season is dark winter, so my sister seasons would be dark autumn and true winter. Thid gives me more wiggle room to style myself.\n\n**Dissonance** are colours that are outside your true season and your sister seasons, you sprinke this in to add interest. Think of an outfit that is extremely matchy and cohesive but has that one accessory or item that stands out and adds interest. It's really fun in art and in fashion.\n\nFor my **shoes** I've started wearing dancing heels which help my flat feet lol and look stylish. Heel insoles help too, as well as the product Shoe Gummi. I still can't last more than 2, 3 hours at most but it's definitely bearable compared to before.\n\nMatching pajamas and loungewear. You just feel so luxurious dressing up at home and they can (should) be comfy :)\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* I wear glasses that work with my heart shaped face.\n* I have a neutral leaning warm undertone so I wear gold jewelry, if I wear pearls or other gem stones I mix in gold to provide more harmony with my skin.\n* Perfume, wear what works with your body chemistry. Some smell delictable on people I know and icky on me, and vice versa. Wear what works for you.\n* Nails, press ons. So convenient, so cheap.\n* Hair accessories, bows, barretes, clips, scrunchies, a ribbon, you could be wearing jeans and a t shirt but a simple hair accessory upgrades the look automatically.\n\n# Makeup\n\nI used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with finding eye looks, brows, blush placement for my face shape\n\nI have a low visual weight face and I am a romantic ingenue, because of this I go for more subtle looks that emphasis two facial features maximum at a time (eyes, lips, cheeks).\n\nDon't get me wrong I love glam bold makeup but soft and subtle makes me glow, I turn heads when my makeup is done like this.\n\n# Teeth\n\n* Wax free floss (Cocofloss $10 expensive but I love it 😅, Burst black floss, Moon graphite floss, Twice floss, Dr. Jen’s silk floss)\n* Oil pulling (coconut oil with clove & tea tree oil, or Guru Nanda oil pulling product)\n* Brush teeth\n* Tongue scraper (not everyday, couple of times a week and not too hard)\n* Alcohol free mouthwash (TheraBreath)\n* More so related to my lip area but I try to use wrinkle preventing straws or when I do use regular straws, I place it on the side of my mouth. The reason this works is because puckering the lips excessively causes smokers lines/wrinkles around the mouth. \n\n# Skin\n\nSkincare. This was something that took me a while to work on because of my PCOS, age, weight and etc.\n\n**Facial Care:** The basics includes chemical exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover. I cycle my nightly skincare routine with this in mind and always keep the same morning routine. Mornings look like this (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, vitamin c/peptide serum, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, finish with sunscreen).\n\nMy nights I alternate these routines in this order\n\nNight 1 - Chemical Exfoliation (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, glycolic/lactic acid, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire face, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\n*Repeat Night 1 - 3 (sometimes I need more days to recover if my skin is sensitive or acting up, do what works for you personally)*\n\nOther things that I've done/used to help: red light therapy (helps with both hair growth, so I use it on my scalp, and with stretch marks so I use it on my face and body), Microcurrent device (helps with collagen production and stretchmarks) - I use the brand NuFace & NuBody, Volufiline (a skin serum I mix with eye cream that helps with hollowness under the eyes, Kigelia Africana Skin Cream (I use the brand Maelys B-Perky which contains this ingredient and helped to tighten my chest area and my loose skin on the area),  face yoga and myo fascia face massage, these help with the tautness of my face (basically everything else helps with wrinkles, these exercises and the microcurrent helps and prevents, sagging especially jowls). I follow tutorials I search for from youtube.\n\n**Body Care:** Similar to facial care body care includes exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover\n\nNight 1 - Physical Exfoliation (Dry brush/Body Scrub, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, retinol body wash, retinol body lotion)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\n*Again, repeat Night 1 - 3 use more days for recovery if needed*\n\n**Stretch marks/loose skin:** Whether due to weight gain, pregnancy, etc. we can't ever truly get rid of loose skin or stretch marks but moisturizing the skin and derma rolling can help with the appearance. Especially derma rolling. Do NOT derma roll while pregnant but you can do so after when you’ve recovered and talk to your doctor (if you've had a c section you have to wait before derma rolling). I used this video as motivation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A)\n\nFor the body I never went beyond 1.5mm it worked for my deepest stretch marks. If this is too aggressive 1.0mm still works just as well. Make sure you use 70% alcohol as this is what experts say is better at disinfecting. It has more water, which helps it to dissolve more slowly, penetrate cells, and kill bacteria. The disinfecting power of rubbing alcohol drops at concentrations higher than 80%-85%. Make sure you disinfect the derma roller before and after use, and make sure you disinfect your area of contact before rolling as well. Do not do heavy workouts workout or sweat inducing activities for at least 3 days after and avoid harsh products.\n\nI started derma rolling while working on losing weight (at the beginning of my journey while still obese) and continued a year after losing 130lbs. Derma rolling works by causing micro tears, the skin heals the area and in the process of doing so develops more collagen - leading to thicker skin, lighter stretch marks and tighter skin. Since I did this before losing the weight it helped my skin adapt a lot. I won't pretend like I have 0 loose skin or stretch marks but it's barely visible. Someone has to be intimately close to notice. Obviously genetics, how slowly you lose the weight, diet, and moisturizing the skin helps but my PCOS contributed to low collagen (thin skin) and so the derma rolling really helped.\n\n# Weight loss vs Fat loss\n\n**Tons of info here but I promise if you read through it helps to know this stuff.**\n\nWeightloss comes down to calories in versus calories out. I know that's rudely simpliflied and not that easy, but it truly is the answer to **weightloss** (which may be fat, water, or muscle). This is why people can eat barely nothing, lose weight but their shape stays the same (basically skinny fat). It's also why fasting or going low carb works so fast (water weight is the first to go).\n\nFatloss on the other hand is more complicated. This involves our TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).\n\nTDEE includes: Resting/Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Metabolic Equivalent of Task or Exercise activity thermogenesis  (EAT), Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), and Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT).\n\n**BMR (\\~70% daily energy)** the energy taken to exist, so tasks like breathing. Your sex, body composition (muscle to fat ratio), age, and genetics play a role in this  \n**EAT (\\~5% daily energy)** the energy taken for exercise weight lifting, swimming, high intensity walks, etc.  \n**NEAT (\\~15% daily energy)** the energy taken for non exercise movements like walking, fidgeting, showering, standing, etc  \n**TEF (\\~10% daily energy depending on the macronutrients of your meal)** the energy taken to digest, protein has the highest TEF of all the macronutrients, Carbs have a TEF of around 5-10%, while Fats have the lowest TEF, around 0-3%.\n\n**Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT)** is the changes in energy expenditure (energy used) that occur in response to changes in energy balance. For example when you eat more food than you need, your body may increase energy expenditure to prevent weight gain eg. move more, eat less the next day, etc.. On the other hand, when you eat less food than you need, your body may decrease energy expenditure to conserve energy and prevent weight loss eg. less movement, eat more the next day.\n\nOther things that affect AT include diet composition (eg high/low protein, high/low carb, calorie dense foods, etc), physical activity (eg. weights vs. cardio), and environmental factors such as temperature and altitude.\n\nThings that influence AT can make weight management challenging, as it can lead to plateaus or rebounds in weight loss efforts. This is why lack of sleep, hormonal issues, aging, etc. makes weightloss harder.\n\n*Here is a clearer example of this*\n\nThings that affect calories in:\n\n* 8-9 Hours of sleep (Maintains metabolic homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, hormonal processes). Compromised sleep lead to:\n   * Increased Gherlin (hunger hormone - feeling hungrier & therefor eating more)\n   * Decreased Leptin (sensation of satiety - needing to eat more to feel full)\n* Insulin resistance: This is when the cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from your blood. This results in excessive sugar in the blood & as a result the body produces more insulin in order to try to help the cells obtain the energy from glucose. This leads to weight gain as the insulin increases hunger. Also, since the body is insulin resistant, the excess glucose is converted to fat for long-term storage.\n   * Things that can cause insulin resistance: PCOS, Inactivity/sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, poor sleep habits, high cholesterol levels, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, high bodyweight, acromegaly\n\nThings that affect calories out:\n\n* Body Composition (Fat to muscle ratio) \n* Gut health\n* Compromised sleep affects our energy levels which leads to\n   * Decreased NEAT (Non exercise activity thermogenesis)\n* Hypothyroidism (lowered levels of T3 and T4)\n   * Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 affects every cell and all the organs in your body by regulating the rate at which your body uses calories/energy which is known as our bmr, meaning this affects your metabolic rate.\n* Too few calories lowers daily NEAT\n   * By eating below your BMI (calories needed to perform basic biological processes), your body makes up for this through energy conservation by lowering your NEAT (non exercise activity thermogenesis). Basically you lack the energy to perform your normal daily activities. This also affects your body composition and cardio health as you become sedentary (stop moving as much).\n\n# Healthy Fat loss\n\nSo to lose fat in a healthy way you need to:\n\n1. Get enough sleep (8-9 hours per night)\n2. **Manage your stress levels/nervous system regulation**\n3. **Look after your gut health**\n4. **Manage inflammation**\n5. Increase your daily steps (8-10k per day)\n6. **Weight lift**\n7. **Eat high protein (protein takes the most amount of energy to digest).**\n8. **Manage your insulin resistence**\n9. **Eat in a caloric deficit (make sure your calories in do not exceed calories out).**\n\nFuther information about the bold items in the list is included below. Also, I know this all seems overwhelming but keep in mind you are creating a lifestyle change. This is not a quick fix. \n\nTo **manage your insulin resistance** (info from the book Glucose Goddess by Jessie Inchauspé):\n\n* Eat within an hour of waking up\n* Protein with breakfast\n* Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before each meal (diluted in a glass of water)\n* Eat foods in this order, veggies -> protein -> fat -> starches -> carbs -> sugar\n* Never eat sweets/dessert/carbs on an empty stomach (dessert after dinner)\n* Keep refined carbs and added sugar at a minimum.\n* Minimize alcohol intake\n* Try to minimize sodas, fruit juice and sweet drinks (this is because there is no fiber to help with the glucose spike or at least try to have these drinks after eating something fiberous)\n* Only eat fruit whole, not transformed eg. eat the orange instead of having the orange juice, again fiber makes a world of a difference\n* Put clothing on your carbs. Eg. have protein/fats/fiber with your carbs\n* A short walk after carb heavy meals\n* Fasting - this is controversial and I should add a disclaimer, if you in any way shape or form have or had an eating disorder, especially restrictive eating, I highly recommend against fasting. Intermittent fasting has a lot of studies out there that were done on men. The book Fast Like a Girl by Dr. Mindy Pelz includes a nuanced view of fasting that takes into account our hormones and our monthly cycle. She also has a free app 'Fast like a girl', you log your period and it tells you how long to fast. However, bioindividuality is key here, genetics, etc. Please if you are considering fasting make sure you get bloodwork done first. Manage your electrolyte levels, do not neglect iron and protein levels. Personally, I prefer using the other methods since fasting can also inadvertently worsens insulin resistence due to increased stress/cortisol which cause higher hunger cues. Some with insulin resistence found fasting to be helpful. So make sure you do what works for you and always consult your doctor. \n* Supplements:\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n   * Inositol\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\nTo eat in a **caloric deficit**, calculate your TDEE and subtract 200-500 calories from that number. I like using this calculator.   \n[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net)\n\nEg. If it's calculated to be 2000 calories, you subtract 200, so 1800 should be your daily calorie intake. For the activity levels make sure you do not oversell yourself. Here is a general guide:\n\n* Sedentary: Office job sat all day or less than 3000 steps per day\n* Lightly Active: Exercise 1-3 times per week or 3-10k steps daily (up to 3-4 miles daily)\n* Moderately Active: Exercise 3-5 times per week or 10-15k steps daily (up to 4-7 miles daily)\n* Highly Active: Hard exercise 6-7 training days per week or 15-20k steps daily (up to 7-10 miles daily)\n* Extremely Active: Intense daily exercise/hard physical labour 7 days a week or 25k+ steps daily (up to 10 miles daily)\n\nAs you lose weight your body adapts so after a while you may need to recalculate your TDEE and deficit. Once you are at your ideal weight, you no longer subtract the 200-500, you simply eat the TDEE amount to maintain but you do this gradually. After I lost the weight I came out of the deficit by adding 50 calories to my daily intake per week, till I was at maintenance/my TDEE. This prevented me from gaining fat or water weight.\n\nLastly, muscle mass (increase in muscle raises your metabolic level, meaning you burn more calories at rest). This is ideal and is also how you'll see someone who is short, seemingly small but weigh more than you imagined. Muscle density weighs more than fat. Think of a 50 pound dumbbell versus 50 pounds of feathers, you would need a whole lot of feathers to match the weight. Same difference, you need a larger volume of fat to equal to the same amount of muscle. Therefore, lifting weights is ideal because you will become more toned, burn more calories at rest, be able to eat more even when you've lost the weight to maintain your phisique, you'll be more insulin sensitive, and you will have stronger and higher bone density (really important for women, we lose up to 5% of muscle mass per decade after the age of 30).\n\n# Body Recompositon: Weightlifting for health (and aesthetics), lose fat & gain muscle\n\nIt is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. I followed Huskular Goddess and and LexiiGettingFit for inspiration and they were really the ones that opened my eyes to the concept of body recomposition (gain musle while losing fat). \n\nThe benefits of this is as you're getting smaller your TDEE is increasing. This means by the time you lose the weight you'll still be eating an adequate amount. The other benefits include insulin sensitivity versus insulin resistence, higher metabolism, and a improved body composition like I mentioned before in the dummbell versus feather example. The downside is the number on the scale won't have a dramatic shift while your clothes will be fitting looser. Again, weight density plays tricks on us and it's easy to get caught up in body dismorphia but I promise it works. \n\nIn order to sustain and build muscle while losing fat, you need to be consuming enough protein while remaining in a caloric deficit. So 60-80g of protein per day minimum to lose 1-2lbs per week. Ideally it should be 0.8-1g of per pound of lean body mass. Eg, someone is 300lbs and they want to get down to 150lbs. They would eat 120-150g of protein per day. If this is too much, try to get at least 60-80g like I mentioned before. Remember even though 1-2lbs per week sounds small, the changes are significant because of the muscle gained. You will look and feel smaller.  \n\n**Weightlifting for a rounder booty** (I reshaped my glutes by weightlifting. Hormones can actually affect the shape and my PCOS did a number on me. I developed a V shape over the years. Round, square, heart, A shapes are all based on your bone structure and fat placement. Some of us just have those stubborn fat deposits in certain areas that are genetic, even when we lose the weight, it's a smaller version but the same shape. V shape on the other hand is largely seen in older women post menopause and in younger women with hormonal disorders. This is becuase the hormonal imbalances also causes muscle imbalances. Regulating your hormones helps but it won't grow the muscles for you, so I used Fit With Emely's glute guide based on your glute shape (completely free, I watched all her videos to get this info and it took me two years to go from a V shape to a round shape.\n\nHere is the guideline for each shape:\n\n**Glute Maximus** - Everyone should be working on glute maximus. It builds the shelf and overall size. Step ups (all variations), hip thrusts (all variations), lunges, rdl, leg press, all squat variations  \n**Glute Minimus** - (V and Square shapes), this muscle fills in the middle between the top and lower glute. Hip abduction, single leg bridge, Standing hip abduction/cable raises  \n**Gute Medius** - (Heart, Round, and A-shaped) this muscles builds a longer hip for top portion of the glutes. Eg. Single leg squat, Single leg deadlift, Cable clamshells, Reverse lung, step ups  \n**Underbutt** - Everyone should be working on underbutt but this is especially useful for V shaped folks. It works the hamstrings and lower portion of glutes. Good mornings, single leg rdl (also works minimus), single leg hip thrust (also works maximus), hip abductors (also works minimus)\n\nHow to structure workout:\n\n* Warm up/Dynamic Stretches (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body warm up or upper body warm up, etc.)\n* Compound exercises (2-3 exercises eg. single leg rdl, good mornings, leg press - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets). That probably sounds like a foreign language to some, so for instance:\n   * **Start excercise 1**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 2**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 3**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n* Secondary Workouts (2-3 exercises eg. step ups, bulgarian split squats, lunges - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets)\n* Isolated/Accessory Movements: these exercises work one part of the muscle more than others, for example an overbias on the underbutt/hamstring like I mentioned before to help with the V shape ( eg. hip abductors, kickbacks, glute bridge, lying leg raises, etc. (1-2 exercises high repetitions, low weight 2-3 sets, 15-20 reps, 1-2 minute rest between sets)\n* Static stretch/cool down (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body cool down or upper body cool down, etc.)\n\nKeep in mind that you only need to work on a muscle group 2-3 times a week. So I only do glutes Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Also keep in mind while I work the lower body I am also working my upper body (eg. while doing rdls I am lifting the weight with my upper body), which is why I don't have tailered upper body days, this is for aesthetic reasons, and because weightlifting more than 3 days per week is not feasible with my PCOS. \n\nMy full routine is:\n\n* Monday- lower body\n* Tuesday - Pilates/core\n* Wednesday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n* Thursday - lower body\n* Friday - Pilates/core\n* Saturday - lower body\n* Sunday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n\nI also used primarily resistance bands in the beginning because gym equipment intimidated me (not anymore :) ). I started with 25lb resistance and went up to 125lbs. I use the product BandBar which allowed me to use the resistance bands like a barbell at home. This isn’t the only option and you can definitely buy resistance bands and do it without the bar. [BandBar](https://shopbandbar.com)\n\nFor the ab separation from being obese, I did this workout 3 times a week (also helpful post pregnancy): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0)\n\nFor my chest to help with getting perkier boobs (the derma rolling was what made the biggest difference, but this exercise helped as well though it took 6+ months for the changes to be significant. Women tend to take longer to grow chest muscles): [https://youtu.be/hg7\\_R29jGIE?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/hg7_R29jGIE?feature=shared)\n\nI also did workouts to help with my posture and mobility 3 times a week (any I could find online)\n\nThe last thing I will say is be mindful that you may gain weight initially when you start lifting weights. This is due to slight inflammation/water gain from foreign tension, which will last about a month or two before you adapt BUT your body will adapt, I promise. Keep in mind if it's days before your period or if you are on your period. It's not if, but when, our weight fluctuates. As long as you are in a deficit and doing everything right, the number will go down. Do not get discouraged!!!\n\n***Here is the edit to this post which includes my supplements, how I managed my inflammation, and how I improved my gut health. I also edited the information I shared prior to include a few more tips and lifestyle changes I made, and included a few more details. I also rearranged things so there is a separation between style/hair/skin and health information. The post is getting really long so I may create a separate post for personal development/mindset tips.*** \n\n# Inflammation\n\nIn my case my inflammation was caused by my PCOS, insulin resistence and my obesity, but it can be caused by chronic stress, other autoimmune disorders like IBS, Crohn's disease, etc, smoking/alcohol, age related diseases, environmental toxins, diets high in processed foods, sugars, trans fats & high omega-6 fatty acids. \n\nIn my case the inflammation from the PCOS led to gut inflammation due to the high levels of coritsal (stress hormones) in reaction to the high testosterone and insulin resistence. I also experienced metabolic inflammation (non alcoholic fatty liver disease), skin inflammation (as I mentioned earlier the ezcema on my scalp, alopecia, and hirsutism), adipose tissue inflammation, chronic low grade inflammation (this led to edema or fuid retention -> insulin resistance and my high testosteron/androgen levels also exacerbated this).\n\nTo fix this these were the thin I added to my life:\n\n* Dry brushing 2-3 times a week\n* Body Gua sha\n* Face Gua Sha or Face Yoga or Myofascial Massage \n* Jump Rope\n* Trampoline/Rebounder\n* Vibration Plate (very useful for after a workout or while sitting down)\n* Acupressure mat\n* Arvigo (Mayan Abdominal massage) & Lymphatic drainage massage\n* Leg elevation, I sleep with a pillow under my knees. In the evenings I keep my legs up.\n* Massages\n* Sweat more (exercise/sauna/steam room)\n* Portable Infrared Sauna (reduce cortisol by 25%)\n* Microcurrent\n* Compression socks\n* Castor oil pack 3-4x per week\n* Eliminate inflammatory triggers (mine were gluten & dairy)\n   * Switch to sourdough\n   * Eliminate seed oils\n   * Avoid alcohol & smoking\n* Supplements\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n* Teas that helped\n   * Turmeric\n   * Red Rasberru Leaf Tea\n   * Fennel\n   * Chamomile\n\n# Gut Health \n\nYour microbiota needs the right bacteria in the right amount to perform its hormone regulating functions properly. When the type or number of bacteria gets disturbed by events such as stress, or poor diet, or your gut can no longer accomplish its job meaning you'll have inflammation, increased risk of chronic disease, skin conditions, mental health issues, weakened immune system, nutrient absorprion problems, and weight management challenges.   \n\n\nFor weight loss issues, gut microbiomes influence hormones in producing and signaling leptin and ghrelin (these hormones regulate hunger and fullness signals). Inflammation and insulin resistence is also associated with gut health problems as mentioned before. Energy extraction from foods, certain gut bacteria are more efficient at extracting energy from food, particularly carbohydrates. When there is an imbalance, more calories can be absorbed from food leading to difficulties gaining or losing weight. \n\nThings I did to improve gut health/intestinal permeability:\n\n* Ate foods rich in digestive enzymes (mangoes, pineapple, etc.)\n* Pre and probiotics (incorporate bifidobacterium and lactobacillus)\n   * Favorite brand: Seed Heath Probiotics\n* Pickles (without vinegar): Great source of prebiotics\n* Apple Cider Vinegar/Kimchi/Kombucha/Sauerkraut\n   * Beware of certain types of vinegar contain chemicals which kill bacteria, “the good bacteria”, and leave the yeast Candida albicans alone.\n   * Raw apple cider vinegar contains: Natural probiotics (friendly bacteria), which may help with your immune system and gut health.\n      * Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (diluted in a glass of water) before each meal\n   * Balsamic vinegar: Acetic acid is the active compound in balsamic vinegar. This acid contains strains of probiotics that aid digestion. The probiotics found in acetic acid can help promote good gut health and digestion while supporting overall immune function.\n* Raw Carrots (has the type of fiber that binds and flushes out toxins in gut, good to have as daily hormone & digestion support)\n* Limit Processed foods and Sugar\n* No drinking or smoking \n* Stress managment (which I'll expand on just below)\n* Increase fiber intake\n* Regularly exercise\n* Supplements\n   * Ginger \n   * L-Glutamine\n   * Olive leaf extract (especially helpful if you have candida overgrowth)\n   * Turmereric \n* Teas\n   * Ginger\n   * Lemon Balm\n\n# Lower androgens/testosterone\n\n* Teas \n   * Nettle Tea\n   * Spearmint tea\n* Spearmint oil topically for hirsutism\n* Supplements\n   * Schisandra (adaptogen - stress management & hormone balance)\n   * Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n   * Inositol\n   * Holy Basil\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\n# Nervous System Regulation/ Stress Management \n\nStress is one of the things that age us the most, and people with PCOS already have higher levels of cortisol so these are the things I do to manage my stress levels:\n\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, direct sunlight upon waking up. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Same bedtime everynight (pre midnight)\n* Invert screen colors at bedtime (red filter on screens)\n* Pillow under knees\n* No loud alarms\n* Magnesium biglycinate supplement before bed\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, view the sunset before bed. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Spend a few minutes breathing through left nostril only\n* Epsom salt foot soak\n* Journal\n* Get back to using my coloring books (I even invested in alcohol based markers it's so fun). Regulates me and gets me in touch with my inner child\n* Time with friends, my puppy, and my family\n* Supplements\n   * Holy Basil (adaptogen - stress management & hormonal balance)\n   * L-Theanine\n   * Magnesium biglycinate \n* Teas\n   * Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen - stress management, also good for menstrual cramps)\n   * Reishi Mushroom\n   * Lemon Balm\n* Night time mocktail (have after dinner and not on an empty stomach due to the sugar levels in the tart cherry)\n   * Teaspoon of tart cherry (high levels of melatonin)\n   * Magnesium biglycinate powder\n   * Probiotic soda (good for gut health)\n\n# Tea cycling\n\n- On your period\n    - Nettle leaf: Increase iron levels\n    - Moringa: Increase iron levels\n    - Red Raspberry leaf: Helps with period cramps (best to drink throughout the month, especially at the end of the luteal phase\n    - Chamomile: Helps with wellness wind down routine when you're feeling extra tired\n- Follicular phase\n    - Focus teas: Peppermint, Spearmint\n    - Adaptogens: Lion's mane, Adaptogen latte, and Chaga mushroom\n    - Detox: Dandelion Root\n- Ovulation phase\n    - Detox: Dandelion root tea\n    - Bloating: turmeric tea latte/golden latte\n    - Estrogen dominance - symptoms (bad hormonal migraines, hot flashes, nausea): Schisandra berry, Lemon balm\n- Luteal phase\n    - PMS symptoms: Raspberry leaf, Schisandra berry, Ginger root (powder or tea)\n\n\nThe best teas for PCOS\n\n- Spearmint\n    - For reducing androgens & lowering hirsutism (facial hair)\n- Cinnamon tea (improves insulin sensitivity)\n- Chamomile tea (Adaptogen)\n- Nettle Tea (reduce androgens)\n- Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen/stress relief, also good for menstrual cramps)\n- Schisandra (adaptogen/stress relief & hormone balance)\n- Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n- Ginger (ginger offers anti-inflammatory, fertility and hormone-balancing benefits, aides digestion )\n\n\n# Seed Cycling\n\nWhat is seed cycling? Seed cycling refers to the consumption of specific seeds at different times of the month in order to improve the production and levels of sex hormones, specifically estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.\n\nSeed cycling divides the female menstrual cycle into two parts:\n\n1. During the first half of the menstrual cycle, or days 1 through 14, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **flax and pumpkin seeds.**\n2. During the second half of the menstrual cycle, or days 15 through 28, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **sunflower and sesame seeds**\n\n*Results from seed cycling will not happen overnight. Normally women observe improvements after approximately three months of seed cycling adherence. It took me about 4ish months.*\n\n**The Benefits of Seed Cycling:** Support hormonal balance, alleviate PMS symptoms, decrease hormonal acne, alter irregularity of menstrual cycles, and fight stomach bloating and fatigue.\n\n",

    "body": "Hey guys,\n\nThis has been happening over the last few days, and will continue over the next few days so will be updating with the final decision sometime soon.\n\nSo about 4 weeks ago I walked into a tattoo and piercing store (“The best and most trusted in the world!”), asking about nipple piercings. I.e. what are the risks and benefits, what kind of price range to expect, aftercare needs, etc.\n\nAfter having a conversation with the piercer about this he told me to expect a price between $100 and $120 at most stores, but that today only he could offer me the piercings plus jewellery for $80. That sounds great, is it okay if I just call my boyfriend and come back? Boyfriend ok’d the early spending money for the next fortnight and we were good to go.\n\nThis piercer wasn’t like some of the other piercers I’ve encountered. After placing the dots on either side of each nipple, he didn’t ask me how i liked the positioning (not that i could have told him, because these dots covered half of each nipple). He didn’t notify me of any issues or the resolutions to said issues. It was simply, “deep breath in, deep breath out” *stab*. At that point I started to get iffy, but I wasn’t about to say anything to the guy with a needle in one hand and my boob in the other. \n\nA few days after having them pierced, I started to get a bit concerned because the small size of the bars he used meant that the holes were stretching over the balls on the ends as they were very constricting. I went to a different tattoo shop to buy longer bars to try to remedy the situation. All was okay for the next couple of weeks. \n\nIt was only when the pain started subsiding and I could actually touch them that I started to have a bit of a look and I saw that the piercings are a lot further back than I was expecting. I went to another piercer, one I had been to before, for their opinion on the positioning. Her advice was to go back and make a complaint, because these are not nipple piercings, these are areola piercings. They don’t even touch my nipples.\n\nBefore I went back to the original piercer, I went to one that I had never visited, for another opinion and received the same advice. So on Saturday, I went back out to the shop where I got them done and spoke to the manager about the problem, saying that I was told by two other professional piercers that the piercings I had were not what I asked for  and not what I had paid for. When she said she was not sure what could be done about this, my request was simple and polite. \n\n“I was wondering if it would be possible for me to have the bars removed and the piercings cleaned, and receive a refund due to the fact that this is not what I asked for?”\n\nManager agrees that these things would all be suitable actions and asked me if I could come back in Monday, because there isn’t a piercer working over the weekends because it’s a bit slow. All good, agreed to come back on Monday.\n\nSo Monday rolls around and I got up early, cooked breakfast for my housemate who offered to drive me instead of having to get a bus, and off we went. Got to the store and the manager said, “I’m really sorry, the man who was supposed to be working today got called to a different location and we don’t have a piercer today”. Their piercers work on a who needs it most kind of basis, so it makes sense. She asked me to come back tomorrow, and I left my mobile number with her so she could let me know if anything changed.\n\nTuesday. Today I got smart and called ahead to ask if the piercer was working today before I left the house. He was booked to be tattooing until 2pm. That’s okay, I’ve got some errands to run anyway. I showed up at the shopping centre about 20 minutes early, having run out of things to keep me occupied. Walked past the shop to go to the pet store with a friend while I waited and noticed the piercer who did my piercings standing there with nothing to do. Manager saw me and greeted me, piercer is ready, he just finished his booking early, I got there right on time! So we had a bit of a chat while the piercer was getting the room ready, sterilising everything, washing his hands, slapping on his gloves. \n\nHe called me into the room and I asked my friend to come with me. After removing the necessary clothing, he inspected them and asked what the problem was. I explained everything to him in detail while he interrupted me every two minutes to the point my friend just said, “how do you expect to know what the problem is if you can’t shut your mouth and listen to her talking”. That shut him up long enough for me to give him a list of the things that I’d already covered while he was too busy trying to defend himself.\n\nAfter I finished he asked me rather rudely, “so what do you want ME to do about it?”\n\nI told him that I would like for him to remove the piercings safely and clean the area with an antibacterial. He made this sound like he was about to say “for f*cks sakes” but stopped himself before it came out. Anyway, he did almost exactly what I asked him to. Almost.\n\nAfter quite aggressively (not safely) removing the bars, he put antibacterial on a cotton ball and wiped each side with it. I told him I appreciate that he was willing to help me, but I don’t appreciate the way he just acted, especially his rough treatment of a sensitive part of my body which was more sensitive due to the fact that  these piercings were still very new.\n\nHis reaction was to speak to me very rudely again, stating that my nipples are tiny so I can’t possibly have expected to get real nipple piercings and have it work. Small nipples tend to push piercings out in a most unpleasant way, so when he pierces nipples that are very small he does it a bit further back. It’s a basic thing for him to do and if i didn’t like it I could take my business elsewhere. Very hushed though, so the manager didn’t hear.\n\nWhen he left the room, I was standing right in front of the door, and when the door is open people walking past the shopfront can see straight through to where i was standing. I was left in a wide open room with my bra only covering me because i saw him going to open the door and hastily picked it up to cover myself. He left the door WIDE OPEN with me standing there half naked. Friend rushed to close it so that I could continue to get dressed again. \n\nWhen I cane out of the room I went back to the manager to receive my refund, and she said to me, “we dont actually do refunds usually, but I can give you store credit.” Oh boy, am I heated at this point. But still, I replied politely, respectfully. Don’t ask me how I kept my cool, I honestly have no idea how. It’s almost midnight now and I’m still reeling from it.\n\nI tried to argue that I had been told on Saturday, by her, that a refund would not be an issue. Nothing was said about store credit, and what would I do with said store credit? After the serving I just got from your piercer I honestly have no desire to return. \n\n“Well, you could sell the credit to your friend, I remember her saying she wanted to get a tattoo. I can set up an account for the credit to be added to.”\n\nYeah sure let’s do that. I have been here an hour already and it’s my third time here in 4 days. I just wanna go home. So the account is set up, repayment sorted with my friend, and off we go back to the car. \n\nAs soon as we got home I called another one of their stores in the area, and asked if there was any regional/district manager or someone a bit higher up than a store manager that I could speak to about an issue at another location. The man there took my details and told me he would ask the owner of their store to get the owner of the other store to contact me. I was called within the hour, explained my issue and how I tried to have it resolved professionally and had originally been met with nothing but smiles and helpfulness, only to have a dreadful experience today. I told him everything that happened. Made sure he knew I wanted to ensure that other customers don’t have experiences like this in the future.\n\nMr Bossman was unimpressed. Apologised profusely, thanked me for trying to handle the situation responsibly (as opposed to walking in angry, making demands, etc.) and also thanked me for letting him know about the situation. He said “I know it’s not an excuse, but [piercer] has some stuff going on at the moment. He’s been spoken to a couple of times already. This time he won’t be piercing for us anymore. I’m sorry that he brought his shit to work with him.”\n\nHe then organised for one of their most qualified and experienced piercers to review the situation (basically she’s gonna look at my boobs and decide whether or not he made the right decision when he put the piercings further back than normal). \n\nMr Bossman said that depending on this piercer’s opinion after our meeting, either he will ask her to pierce me properly free of charge (once the current holes close and heal), or he will provide me with $100 store credit to be used at any of their stores to go towards other piercings or even a tattoo. Not exactly what I was going for, but I’ll take that deal. I thanked him for taking my complaint and his help, his patience and also asked him to thank the piercer for agreeing to come in to see me on a day when she wasn’t originally going to be working. Overall it’s looking like there will be a great result, but to be completely honest I’m a little worried that the helpful attitude will again disappear on the day. Fingers crossed though and I really hope that I’m wrong. \n\nSo on Thursday night I will update with whatever happens at my appointment, good or bad!\n\n\n\nUpdate:\nI am so so sorry I have taken so long to update! I swear i typed it out on Thursday night and I’m sure I pressed the button to update the post but it must not have gone through! I didnt check it until now though, so I’m sorry to those who’ve been waiting since thursday for the update!!\n\nSo I went to see the new piercer on Thursday afternoon, and was told not only did the guy pierce my boobs in the wrong place (new piercer being a female with small nipples as well told me that what the guy told me was absolute BULLSHIT) but he also pierced me the wrong way!!! I told him that I wanted them for sensitivity reasons, and they pierce differently for people who want sensitivity, but because most people just want them for the looks he just pierced me the looks way and not the sensitivity way!\n\nSo the advice from this piercer was to go to a chemist and buy a saline mixture with tea tree oil in it, and vitamin E oil (saline and tea tree to clean and prevent infection, and vitamin e to prevent scarring) she also said to bring in the receipt on wednesday when I go to see her again and she will reimburse me the full cost of these products because the original piercer was completely at fault. She was talking about “when i repierce them” so i 100% will be getting them redone, and I’m quite confident with letting her do them because she and a few others there told me that she does all of her own piercings (inluding her own nipples - no thank youuu) and also there are so many 5 star google reviews from other people who mention her name as their piercer, so i’m really excited to get my nipples pierced properly!\n\nWill update again after my next appointment (Wednesday) and this time I’ll check to make sure it actually updated the post!\n\nUpdate: appointment has been moved to Monday, I’ll let you guys know how it goes!",

You don't need to join the APP to pierce someone, but their standards are the highest in the industry, and I couldn't go anywhere that isn't certified myself.

After many tests they finally learned that it was something called a sarcoma. Decided to google it and both of us are very scared. \n\nHis mom refuses to allow him to get it treated by a hospital because \"she doesn't trust them.\" She is using this cream to treat it. I do not know the name of the product, but I know it is basically just a cream based off of tea tree oil. \n\nFrom my vast knowledge of google searches, I can already tell this is bunk medicine and that he has cancer that is going untreated. \n\nHis parents refuse to get him help because they don't have the money and because they simply do not believe that the lump is cancer. His grandparents are desperately trying to get him help but keep running into brick walls. \n\nBasically we need a very fast solution here as the clock is literally ticking. Can CPS force the parents to get him treatment? Can he go to the hospital himself and demand treatment? What can be done here. \n\nThe location is Texas if that matters. His grandmom is in Arkansas.

        "body": "Sorry for the delay in replying to you guys. Teachers caught me on my cell phone at school and took it up. Had to get it back from the principals office after school ended.  \n\nMy friend told the school nurse, like you guys suggested, but she didnt know what a sarcoma was or if he actually had one. She gets tons of kids complaining about fake stuff all of the time to try to go home. \n\nThey called his mom who then came up and paddled him two times. Our school allows corporal punishment as long as the parents are present. Sometimes the parents do the paddling. Basically they claimed he was lying about what he had and that he just wanted to get out of school. \n\nAfter this, he called his grandparents and told them everything. He told me at noon that they were leaving their house in Hope and were making the drive down to have it out with his parents. \n\nThey just left his house after the police forced them to leave. I live across the street and watched it all unfold. From what I gather, they are calling CPS as per the police instructions. \n\nI do not know what is going to happen but when I asked his grandparents if he was going to get treatment they told me they were going to stay in town until that child either gets the help he needs or dies. The grand dad said that if all else fails they will just take him themselves. \n\nEDIT: Immediately after posting this my parents asked me what is going on with them. I told them that my friend was diagnosed with cancer and that his parents are refusing to allow him to get proper treatment. My parents are pissed and are calling CPS as I type this. Several times in the past they have let their son's illnesses go untreated. They are extreme hippies who believe that the government is out to get them. They grow their own food and rarely buy meat from the supermarket. If it were not for my parents giving me double lunch money, he would go hungry during lunch at school as they usually pack an apple, or a cucumber, or some other fruit or vegetable for him to eat at lunch.",

However, at 15, your friend is almost of an age to advocate to have treatment (or decline it). With his grandparents willing to help, that should be a good starting point.\n\nYes, he and his grandparents can report his parents to CPS. That's why CPS exists. Putting in a direct complaint that a potentially severe medical condition is not being treated by medicine per a doctor's recommendation is one way to handle it. Another thing he should do, talk to his school counselor and/or nurse. There will be protocols in place at his school. \n\nHave your friend reach out to his doctor and/or primary care physician to ask what they can do. It is possible to have treatment without medical insurance, but being a minor can make this more difficult. Do his parents have insurance? \n\nYou might also ask on /r/insurance to see what possibilities exist for requesting treatment.",

    "body": "These pics are about 7 years apart (right pic is from 2 weeks ago, no make up) but in between that time I went through accutane, as suggested by my dermatologist who never once asked me about my diet. My severe pimples healed but my face stayed puffy and inflamed. After accutane my face didn't completely heal and I developed eczema on my eyelids, nose, ears and mouth (never had it before accutane). Went on eczema medication, constantly had flare ups, started to develop it in other parts of my body, still continued to have acne (although not as severe). \n\nStarted carnivore in Jan 2024 and within 2 months my pimples cleared up. Within 6 months all my eczema disappeared, aside from the monthly 1-3 zits I get around my cycle. I stopped getting dandruff, my hair wasn't as thined out and the inflammation in my face went away. I even noticed my eyesight got better, I no longer wear glasses. My period pain is gone, energy levels are amazing, no more allergies, no more split ends, the list goes on, but this post was about my skin. \n\nI'm posting this here because I got banned from r/acne and carnivore is what I mostly attribute to healing my body inside and out. Any time I would suggest to someone in need that changing my diet is what changed the game for me, I get down voted and finally I was banned 🥴.  \n\nSkincare routine now is very minimal. I wash my face with tea tree oil face wash, face mask once a week with manuka honey and use a tallow moisturizer. No sunscreen, I never burn anymore. Hope this helps someone else on the fence about the diet and in need of some skin help! ",

    "body": "1. oil.  I never oiled when I first started bearding.  I started this time and I wish I could hop in a DeLorian, speed up to the necessary 88 miles per hour, jump out of the car slap my past self for this.  Jojoba is a great ingredient to have in your beard oil, it is the closest replicant to the sebum oil that your skin produces.  tea tree oil is good for killing fungus and cutting down beardruff. vitamin E is a good oil for the health of your skin which is in-turn good for the health of your beard.  good oil will make rubbing your beard feel like you are combing your fingers through silk. \n\n\n2. light trimming.  every few weeks just do some basic trimming.  not enough to lose length, just get rid of those straggly hairs and this will help with removing split ends.  but if you use oil, the split end isue should not be as big of a problem.  Don't use an electrical trimmer, those just leave a crap-ton of split ends.  Use good barber scissors.  those do the trick.\n\n\n3. Condition!  CONDITION YOUR BEARD!!! I had to repeat it to get this through.  conditioning your beard will do wonders for the health of your beard.  slap on a good amount, set it and forget it...for a few minutes. don't put it on and then rinse it off within moments.  that is just a waste of conditioner.  rinse it off after a few minutes have passed. I've noticed that the best conditioners are the ones that you rub between your fingers and they leave your fingers feeling slippery after you rinse \n\n\n4. don't trim after shower!! for the love of god, don't make this mistake.  When you are fresh out of the shower, your beard hairs are heavy with water and your beard will appear longer than it usually appears when dry.  as soon as it dries, it will shrink as a result of the water evaporating and the hairs not being weighed down, allowing them to spring back up.  if you trim after you shower, you will probably cut off far more than what you desire and you'll get sad that you lost half a month's worth of growth.  don't pull out the scissors until AFTER your beard has dried. \n\n5. Boars hair brush.  brushing in general is something you gotta do to promote good healthy growth.  it stimulates the hair follicles and speeds up growth as well (this is what my stylist taught me).  it also keeps the skin down there healthy which is definitely a big deal since you don't want flaky skin and beardruff (oiling is also important for this reason).  A boars hair brush is the greatest purchase I have ever made for my daily beard upkeep.  CVS sells a two sided one that's only $4!! not sure if it's real boars hair, probably not, but it's great nonetheless. the brush is better than a comb because it does a great job of dispersing the oils in your beard around evenly.  a little gets on your brush but that makes the brush better.  it's personal value goes up with use...though don't try selling it secondhand for more money using the argument that its covered in your beard oils.  I don't know how well that sales pitch will work.  then again, with the stuff people buy on Craigslist nowadays, I wouldn't be amazed. \n\n\n6. genetics. don't get frustrated trying to replicate someone elses beard.  more likely than not, you won't be able to get the same look, thickness, shape, yada yada yada.   beards are like fingerprints.  their appearances are greatly dictated by your genes and unless you are an identical twin or a clone, you are a very unique set of genes, with a unique beard.  let it grow naturally and appreciate that you are growing a one-of-a-kind gem that no one else has on the planet.  you may think some gems are prettier than others, but no one can take a sapphire and turn it into a diamond.  Also, some people like sapphires more than diamonds.  \n\n7. friends and family will try to convince you to shave.   A few years ago, I decided to not give a shit what my friends and family were telling me about shaving.  what happened?  within two months of growth, I got a call from Warner Bros to audition for a movie.   I got a small speaking part in Argo (http://imgur.com/hkhH2Zg and also http://imgur.com/PSYMWHp  @ approximately 2.5 months growth).  It turns out, I was one of the few people that went to the background extra call prepared with a beard.  as a result, they said I matched the look they want and they gave me an audition, an upgrade to a small speaking part, and movie credits too.  I learned a very valuable lesson that day.  Your beard is your own business.  If I had listened to others and shaved my beard, then I wouldn't have had such an amazing life experience, not to mention a check off the bucket list. people will say that a beard is dirty.  they have no idea what they are talking about!  A good beard requires SO MUCH UPKEEP.  Other parts of my body are probably starting to get jealous with how much attention I'm lavishing on my beard. I wish having a good beard was accomplished by doing nothing and being dirty, alas that ain't the way it is. \n\nMy beard @ [2 months](http://imgur.com/lvBnose)\n\nUPDATE:      [3 months](http://imgur.com/a/FcCIw)\n\nUPDATE 2:    [3.5 months](http://i.imgur.com/hmQaL7W.jpg)\n\nUpdate 3: [4.5 months](http://i.imgur.com/p6v7OTi.jpg?1)\n\nUpdate 4: [5 months](https://imgur.com/a/OprcL)\n\nUpdate 5: [6 months](http://i.imgur.com/gOtQ9UR.jpg?1)\n\n[7 months](http://imgur.com/r/beards/S04Hg9Y/)\n\nBe patient, KEEP ON BEARDING!!\n",

    "body": "Hello TIFU, first post, on a throwaway because I am primarily a lurker.\n\nSo this fuck up actually did happen tonight. \n\nEarlier today, I sat down and noticed that I couldn't get comfortable. For some reason my ass decided to suddenly be irritated by the fabric of my underwear. I was reminded of the irritation repeatedly throughout the day, and made a mental note to toss out the apparently very scratchy pair of boxer briefs when I got home. \n\nOnce I did get home, the slight irritation remained as I stripped to get into the shower. With the help of the bathroom mirror, I realised my left ass cheek looked like I had just concluded a visit to a paddle-happy  dominatrix, or maybe that I had decided to sunbathe for too long, with everything covered apart from exactly half of my butt. Just a big bright red splotch that felt like a sunburn too, very sore and very sensitive to the warm water from my shower.\n\nThe genius that I am, I decided no way in hell am I going to the doctor for an ass rash, I'll have to do something about it myself! I remembered some advice from my mother, according to her, \"Tea tree oil can cure ANY skin problem.\" \n\nNow I don't always listen to her advice, but I'm home for the holiday, and there's always some tea tree oil in the bathroom cupboard here. How lucky for me, right? So I grabbed it. \n\nThe first couple of seconds weren't so bad, but the longer it had contact with my skin, the more it burned. First it felt like a mild rope burn, then it felt like a thousand fire ants were attacking my ass.\n\n I hoped the burning  would go away if I washed it off with water, but the demon fondling my ass cheek was undeterred. I stood naked in the bathroom for twenty minutes because I couldn't sit down or even put any pants on because it stung too bad.\n\nEventually I decided I didn't want to stand in the cold bathroom any more, so I just said \"fuck it\" and got dressed anyway. The friction from the fabric got to be too painful in just the short walk to my room, however, and now I'm typing this lying on my stomach, bare assed, in my bed. \n\nTo add insult to injury, that hellish oil smells terrible. Fuck this. \n\nTLDR; I used a home remedy on an unidentified butt rash, turns out said remedy was actually hell juice and now my ass is on fire.  ",

Make sure you rinse it off completely before putting anything else on, but I’d follow the advice of a previous commenter on the aloe Vera. If the area is burning, see if you can get aloe Vera with menthol (if you use Banana Boat, I believe it’s the blue gel). That will help immensely with the pain as well. \n\nFeel better!",

    "body": "This is really long, but I'm putting this out there for anyone whom it may help. I had a SEVERE case of dyshidrotic eczema for two years. It wasn't just an occasional flare-up, it was a chronic, near-debilitating condition. My skin is finally clear, and I want to share what worked for me - and it's been accomplished without heavy doses of strong meds or creams or anything like that. \n\n\n**Background**\n\nAbout two and a half years ago, my dog and I went for a hike on a little-used trail in some Florida scrub. It had rained heavily that week and after dodging huge swaths of mud almost continuously for two miles, I decided to take a short-cut on another little-used trail to get back to my car. We got about a half-mile into the trail before I came to a section that was almost completely washed out. I was hot and tired, and decided to do something stupid - I decided to soldier right on through it. My shoes and socks were soaked through with mud, my dog was muddy, but we got through it. I thought nothing of it for about a week. \n\nFirst I got extremely itchy spots on the top of both of my feet. I would scratch without thinking, and within two weeks, the spots had spread until they were weeping and raw all of the time. The wounds were probably two inches by two inches on the top of each foot. I couldn't even wear shoes without tears coming to my eyes when I had to walk any distance. It was so ugly and awful that I wore closed-toed shoes all of the time, despite the fact that it rubbed against my skin. I just couldn't take the looks people would give me when they caught sight of my feet. I'm not crazy about doctors, but none of the over-the-counter remedies had given me any relief whatsoever, so I went to a dermatologist at the recommendation of a friend. He gave me some steroid creams, the wounds healed up, and again I thought no more about it. \n\nA couple of weeks after that, I started to get small, fluid-filled blisters on my hands and the sides of my feet. I work a lot in seawater and thought maybe I was having a reaction to something in the water, so I tried to limit the time when my hands and feet were wet with saltwater. However, it got no better, and by the end of the month, the blisters were numerous, large, itchy and painful. Every morning I examined my hands and feet and was dismayed that there always seemed to be new blisters. When the blisters would crack and ooze, the skin underneath was extremely tender and raw. I got used to wearing bandages on my hands and feet at all times. \n\nI work with the public at an environmental education center, and obvsiouly having continuously bandaged hands wasn't a good look. So, I reluctantly booked an appointment with a new dermatologist and embarked on a two year journey of total fucking misery with my skin. \n\n\n**Original Treatments**\n\nIf my dermatologist immediately knew it was dyshidrotic eczema, he didn't tell me right away. He examined my hands and my feet, put me on some antibiotics, and sent me on my way. That didn't help. I went back a couple of weeks later and was prescribed some steroid creams and was told to do diluted bleach baths for my hands and feet 3x a week. For a while, this seemed to quell the worst of it. \n\nThen it was like my skin just exploded. I would get such large blisters on the soles of my feet (it was no longer just contained to the side of my feet) that I was barely able to walk, and would have to go to walk-in clinics and have them drained. When they would test the fluid that came out of the blisters, nothing unusual was found. For a while, they even thought I had MRSA and put me on the strongest antibiotics on the market - it did absolutely nothing. The blisters on my hands were so large and painful that even things like typing on a keyboard was misery. \n\nOver the course of the next two years, my dermatologist and I threw everything we could think of at my dyshidrotic eczema. Name any steroid cream, I've been on it. Name any type of anti-fungal medicine - oral and topical - and I've been on it, both prescription and over-the-counter. I did the bleach baths. I even tried apple cider vinegar baths and also mixed it in with everything I was drinking, having heard that that helps some people. I did yogurt baths, and ate the plain organic yogurt that tastes like shit. I would slather steroid ointment on my hands and feet and night, and wear cotton gloves and socks to keep the ointment in place. I tried several types of essential oils, like tea tree oil and several others, to no avail. Absolutely nothing helped. I was in total misery. \n\nAbout nine months ago, my dermatologist reluctantly put me on a strong course of Prednisone. He hadn't wanted to do it, since he (rightly) said that it was a treatment, not a cure, and that I couldn't be on a heavy dose for too long. I started taking 60mg of Prednisone a day. For good measure, he also started me on mycophenolate, which is an immuno-suppressant normally given to transplant patients before their transplant surgeries. I was on 2g (yes, grams) a day; any time I called the special pharmacy to have that delivered, I was always asked what transplant I was getting. If I could have had a skin transplant, believe me brothers and sisters, I would have done it. During this time, I was still on steroid creams and ointments daily. The meds made me absolutely wired. I don't think I slept for close to a month due to the Prednisone and the stomach cramps from the mycophenolate were miserable. \n\nThe blisters went away, and I felt like a brand new human for a while. Anyone who has suffered with severe dyshidrotic eczema knows what a toll it takes on your self-esteem and your self-image. I went on dates for the first time since this started. Hell, there were even days here or there when I didn't have to wear a bandage, or I was only wearing one or two. I could walk around in flip-flops and I wasn't ashamed. \n\nI started to taper the prednisone, and once I got down to 30mg a day and 2g of mycophenolate, the blisters roared back to life as though they'd never skipped a beat. My dermatologist had hoped that by giving my skin several months to heal, that once I started to taper the Prednisone, that my skin would be able to combat whatever it was that was causing the dyshidrotic eczema. It didn't. It had only stalled it temporarily. \n\nI'm always going to remember sitting in the dermatologist's office four months ago and the defeated look on my derm's face when I showed him my fucked up hands and feet. I was on 30mg of Prednisone and 2g of mycophenolate a day. I was doing steroid creams 2x a day and the ointment at night with gloves and socks. I was doing bleach baths, apple cider vinegar baths and drinks every day, and using essential oils every day. No one was more dedicated to my recovery than me - I wanted my fucking life back. He reluctantly told me that he had done all he could do, that I would probably be on immuno-suppressants and rounds of Prednisone for the rest of my life, and that he was referring me to the Mayo Clinic, that maybe they could help. I was absolutely crushed, Reddit. Crushed. \n\nBut I also knew that there had to be a way out of this. People must have suffered from dyshidrotic eczema in the days before heavy meds and steroid creams. There had to be a way out of this. That's where you come in, Reddit. \n\n\n**A New Perspective**\n\nAbout three months ago, I stumbled on this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/384iiz/dyshidrotic_eczema_healing_successful/\n\nI talked with /u/benf101 about what had worked for him/her, and followed the links s/he gave me. I devoured the links, scraping up every bit of info I could. I had not seriously considered that this form of eczema, or at least my particular case, could be an internal problem rather than a purely external one. I had thought that it might be (hence drinking diluted ACV and plain organic yogurt), but nothing I could find online supported that and my dermatologist was a little leery of that theory, plus, nothing I had done in that regard had done shit for me. I did a LOT of thinking about it, and thought that maybe this was a gut problem, and that my gut was pushing the toxins out through my skin. I had never targeted the problem directly, hence, I was chronically dealing with the most visable outcome of that problem. \n\nThere is evidence that dyshidrotic eczema may be a food allergy and/or indicative of an extreme candida overgrowth in the gut. It's possible that some candida overgrowth can be triggered by fungus picked up in the environment, which is what I believe happened to me, as I'd never had this issue before. The fungus is commonly called a dermaphyte. You can't, and shouldn't, try to get rid of candida entirely, as everyone needs it in their digestive tract. However, an overgrowth in certain individuals can manifest in forms of severe eczema. Diet changes and supplements can curb or eradicate the problem in certain individuals. I just prayed that I was one of those individuals. \n\n\n**What Finally Worked**\n\nDiet Changes: For three months thus far, I have completely cut out wheat, refined sugars, alcohol and switched to a low-carb, whole food diet (with the majority of my carbs coming from root veggies). This is hard as shit for someone like me, but stuff like refined sugars, carbs (which turn into sugars) and alcohol can feed the candida overgrowth. Wheat, in some individuals, can also contribute to the problem. I have recently started to re-introduce alcohol (because life ain't worth living without beer every now and then) to no ill effect thus far. You must do the diet for at least 3 months before starting to slowly add foods back into your diet (unless you're a dummy like me who needs a beer sometimes), to see if one of them triggers a breakout. \n\nSupplements: I started taking strong probiotics twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening). I also started using oil of oregano. Twice a day, I dilute 6-7 drops of oil of oregano in a glass of water (oil of oregano burns like hell, you MUST dilute it) and drink it, and then dilute 4-5 drops in olive oil and apply it to my hands and feet. \n\nDie-Off Symptoms: I did have candida die-off symptoms, though they were not as bad as I'd prepared myself for. I had a few rashes, a few bouts with the porcelain goddess, and a few days when I felt fuzzy and tired, but that all quickly passed. \n\nAbout two weeks after starting this regiment, my blisters started disappearing. I dropped down to 20mg of Predinose, and then quickly down to 10mg of Prednisone a day (that withdrawal was NOT fun). I also dropped down to 1g of mycophenolate a day, since I couldn't take the damn stomach cramps anymore. \n\nAfter a month, I woke up to my first day with NO new blisters in two years. I dropped down to 5mg of Prednisone at the behest of my dermatologist. I switched to taking mycophenolate every other day instead of every day. Each time I dropped the dosage of one of my meds, I would have a small outbreak of blisters on my hands, but nothing close to what it had been. The blisters were smaller and healed much faster than they had been. \n\nAfter two months, I had dropped the mycophenolate completely and was down to 5mg of Prednisone every other day, which is where I still am. A new blister popped up every now and then, but would begin to heal within 2 days. None of them burst. None of them required a bandage. None of them got very big. \n\nThis morning, I went to my standing dermatologist appointment. He examined my hands, and was very surprised. He wanted to know all about the diet and supplements, and wrote it all down, as he said he may be able to suggest it to others who have been long-suffering with this as I had. The nurse even took pictures of my hands and feet to show how much better the condition is now. For the first time in two years, I walked out of the dermatologist's office without making a new appointment before I left. I'm now on a \"as-needed\" basis, like a normal fucking human being. \n\nIt's been close to three months and I feel like a new person. I feel like I am finally going to beat this. I am still doing the 5mg of Prednisone every other day, and when my bottle runs out in two weeks, I will be off of it completely. Otherwise, it's just the diet change and the supplements. That's it. \n\nOur bodies have a blueprint to heal themselves of many conditions we normally treat with strong medicine. I now firmly believe that this is one of them. I'm not saying that what I did will work for everyone, but if you have as bad a case as I did, try it. You have nothing to lose. If nothing else, you'll eat healthy for a few months and get your gut back in good working order. And it may just save your self-esteem (and your skin!) like it did for me. \n\n",

I managed to get it under control (after a lot of suffering) and it seemed I was completely free of it. Until November 2013 when the little blisters began to appear on my right hand again after 15 years. \n\n(I uploaded a gallery of images here: http://imgur.com/a/A3Ct8. The photos are in reverse order - start at the bottom to see how it progressed). \n\nI have very bad reactions to the steroid creams so my doctors prescribed prednisone (on-and-off for 18 months), and an immunosuppressant (Cyclosporine) for four months.\n\nThe immunosuppressant made me nauseous for the first two months straight - I lost weight because I had no appetite - and the prednisone raised my blood pressure, which made me feel even sicker. Awful drugs.\n\nI also found a change in diet is absolutely the way to go! Now I get very minor flare-ups and only occasionally. I know the eczema is triggered when I eat shit (chocolate and other sugary foods, or any heavily processed foods, really). I've been off soft drinks (fizzy drinks) since December 2013. \n\nIt really annoys me that the doctors I saw were all about pumping me with pills, as a medium/long term solution. Never once did they discuss my diet with me or provide me with a more holistic approach.\n\nSo yeah, I'm really, really happy for you :)",

I do already take a probiotic and I take the prebiotic Inulin. \n\nI’m just here to say thank you for speaking on the mental and emotional toll this problem causes. My hands look like I’m a mutant. I wear gloves and tape them at the wrists to shower because water BURNS. I don’t like to touch anything out of my house because then I have to wash my hands. Hand sanitizer is incredibly painful. \n\nI’ve definitely had problems with candida overgrowth in the past. Once I cut out dairy, it helped a lot. It’s definitely inflammation related for me. I think it’s brought on by an allergy to our dog that we got around the same time as my hands started to get really bad but who knows. I had a pet rat growing up that would flare my hands as well. \n\nThank you for the post and to everyone who has posted here. It’s a testament to how miserable this condition is that I’m finding it in 2024 when you originally posted in 2016.",

        "body": "Thank you for writing this up. It is crazy how debilitating eczema is. I’ve dealt with mild-severe eczema my entire life. Growing up dermatologists would prescribe topical steroids which did absolutely nothing for me. In my early twenties it went away, but when COVID happened something changed and my hands were nearly covered with blisters and I would wake up in the night itching like crazy. I had all but surrendered my favorite activities that required heavy use of my hands. Flakes of skin were left everywhere I went and around anything I used. Then I went on vacation and miraculously my skin started to clear up and the itching went away. I had been on an elimination diet to no avail, and on the trip I ate whatever I wanted. Then it clicked - my water source was different. I had read some books with elimination diets that called for filtered water. I dismissed this as where I live has reasonably good water quality. I realized that when COVID started I began working from home and drinking almost strictly tap water. When I got home  immediately started filtering all of my drinking water and any water I used in meals. Within weeks my hands had healed and I got my life back.\n\nI own a Berkey filter myself, and each time I clean the filters it is disgusting what they have pulled out of the water. Just another thing to consider that tap water may seem fine but you will be surprised what you are putting in your body. I now recommend water filters to anyone and everyone even without health issues. I get flair ups from time to time and continue to monitor what I eat and how it’s impacting me. Cutting out a few things (like coffee) that seem to be impacting my gut health.",

As someone who has struggled with dishydrotic eczema foe years, I had my stool tested, there was no candida growth and is definitely not the cause for me.     Don't get me wrong, cutting out sugar and eating whole foods is great for many reasons, but candida is a fad problem that truly only effects a small number of people.    A little yeast on your gut is normal.\n\nPrebiotic, prebiotic, oil of oregano, and more of these fad solutions didn't work for me.   What's more, self treating by eating concentrated oregano and other stuff could cause other issues.    If you believe diet is the issue, don't do fad diet stuff.  Reduce carbs and sugars and eat whole foods.  Do a complete revamp or your diet.  \n\nTo be fair, I still struggle with dishydrotic eczema. But I haven't completely changed my diet yet.

I still had blisters on my hands and used my Clobedisol ointment for frequent outbreaks.  But, during my ten-day trip, which started in the city of Tequila, where Tequila was invented, AND numerous tastings of the best Tequilas, my hands cleared up entirely.\n\nTequila and mainly the agave from with it is made contains a powerful PREbiotic called Inulin (or Inulina in Spanish).  You can get an agave extract of pure Inulin powder, and you add a tablespoon to a hot drink before meals.  And it tastes great, slightly sweet.\n\nI still enjoy and occasional Tequila. It helped that I was sampling really good ones made from 100% agave.\n\nPREbiotics help create the environment for PRObiotics to thrive and do their work and discourage the growth of the bad flora in your gut.  I was trying all sorts of PRObiotics, but for me, in the end, it was the right PREbiotic that made all the difference.",

This was originally a comment that I think warrants its own post.\n\nWhile recognizing that not all ingredients can undergo the rigors of scientific testing, I've tried to make sure that the noted effects do have a basis in science and are backed by one or more studies. However, the list has been cobbled together from research studies and review anecdotes, so keep in mind that each ingredient has varying degrees of evidence backing it, and adjust your expectations accordingly. This list is also far from comprehensive in terms of both ingredients and their purported effects. \n \nIf you have any ingredients you'd like to see added to this list, or if you have research sources/information on the effects of a particular ingredient, let me know in the comments!\n\nA similar and much better formatted resource is here in [table](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-JKhIZ8jBFMJ:www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3fnvcp/beginners_ingredient_guide/%3Fref%3Dreadnext_4+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RYJ2GoHjDCJWwmJbM1K29jNR_o8CX-K_JCRfElKTdzs/edit#gid=0) form, and includes popular products featuring those ingredients.

    "body": "Second in my series aimed at compiling recommendations offered from members of the AB community for addressing common skin concerns. If you missed it, the first of the series can be found here: [ROSACEA, REDNESS, and IRRITATION](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4v2uii/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)\n\nProducts, tips, or advice that come up frequently will be listed in **bold.** I have grouped everything that's toner -> ampoule since the lines can get kind of blurry in those categories, and oil-based and foaming cleansers are also grouped.\nI have included Western products in order to be inclusive of the advice found on this subreddit. I have tried to place those items lower on the list in each category to give prominence to Asian items, given the nature of this sub.\n\nPlease feel free to add to the comments - if you see your HG for acne isn't listed, tell me! I would love for this to be a working document that is edited as needed, so we can also consider converting into a similar format as it exists over on r/SkinCareAddiction\n\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** *What follows is a compilation of the advice given on this subreddit to address conditions associated with cystic and comedonal acne and breakouts. It is not a substitute for medical advice or the advice of a dermatologist, nor are they indicative of my own preferences or what I would personally advise. Before trying any new product, it behooves you to check ingredient lists, take note of personal or individual sensitivities, patch test, and introduce only one new product at a time.*\n\n*IF YOU HAVE A FEVER, SEVERE HEADACHE OR NECK STIFFNESS, EYE IRRITATION, LIP OR OTHER FACIAL SWELLING, PLEASE LEAVE THE INTERNET AND SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM A HUMAN BEING. IN PERSON.*\n\n**For those of you experiencing hormonal outbreaks**, its important to communicate this with your healthcare provider. Hormonal acne may be a sign of other endocrine/hormonal issues that should be evaluated by a medical professional. Please do not rely on Dr. Internet for addressing issues of hormonal imbalance.\n\n**Another Note:** This list proved quite difficult to compile, given that many contributors with oily/acne-prone skin are using multiple actives and/or retinoids to treat their skin. As such, many use products to restore a depleted moisture barrier that may prove far too heavy for someone with oily skin who is NOT using these treatments. I strongly urge use of this list merely as a starting point, and advise looking at the original threads for additional details. In the meantime, I do plan on doing a separate post for \"tretface,\" overexfoliation, or an otherwise damaged moisture barrier, so stay tuned!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n*Cleansers*\n\n* It's Skin Green Tea Calming Cleansing Oil\n\n* Kose Softmymo Speedy Cleansing Oil\n\n* Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil - note that some users experienced breakouts from use of this product; as always, patch test and check ingredient lists for known sensitivities before use\n\n* Banila Co Clean It Zero Purity\n\n* Shu Uemura Brightening Cleansing Oil (blue bottle) \n\n* The Face Shop Rice Cleansing Oil \n\n* Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming cleanser\n\n* Hada Labo ES Foaming cleanser\n\n* COSRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser\n\n* Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash Cleanser \n\n* Acwell 5.5 Bubble-Free pH Balancing Cleanser \n\n* * Himalaya Neem Gel Cleanser\n\n* **Cerave Foaming Face Wash**\n\n* Derma-E Hydrating Cleanser\n\n* Bifesta Cleansing Lotion Moist\n\n*Actives*\n\n* Read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3cgyyr/what_is_your_actives_routine/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4r8bpx/how_do_you_schedule_acidsactives_in_your_routine/) for more about how to incorporate actives into your AB routine\n\n* OST Original Pure Vitamin C20 Serum \n\n* COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid\n\n* Papa Recipe White Flower Clear Up 8% AHA Gel\n\n* **COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid**\n\n* Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel \n\n* Stridex Maximum Strength - BHA\n\n* Spironolactone - women with hormonal acne only, oral, RX\n\n* **Curology** - RX, tele-dermatology service to address acne or aging, with semi-tailored skin cream often containing a trio of ingredients, often including tretinoin, azaleic acid, clindamycin, zinc, niacinamide, vitamin C.

It can be easy to want a quick fix, but most products that address acne or problem skin take TIME and consistency.\n\n* Remember even if you are generally acne free, you can still get a breakout now and then and it doesn't mean the products have failed. It's better to look at acne in an overall general improvement kind of way, rather than all or nothing, otherwise you are going to feel like you're failing constantly (u/TrishBrennan) \n\n* Make sure to rule out dehydration/compromised moisture barrier as the cause of your acne. Acne can be caused by many things (diet, allergy, hormones, even fungus!) but the easiest version to cure is the one caused by dehydrated, overworked skin. (u/Daheep)\n\n* Be careful to avoid overexfoliation, which can make your acne worse. Many acne patients, especially those familiar with the classic Western medical approach to acne can be over-exuberant with their exfoliators, leading to a compromised moisture barrier, which can lead to more reactive skin. The AB (and in many ways, SCA) approach is far more gentle, aiming to treat acne-prone skin with hydration and only using as much exfoliation as necessary. \n\n* **Stop all other actives when starting prescription acne treatments,** namely chemical exfoliants or any other potentially irritating parts of your routine.\n\n* Make sure you have a solid base routine with a good moisturizer before starting prescription treatment, as many prescriptions can rapidly and drastically deplete your moisture barrier. **A healthy moisture barrier is critical to clear skin.**\n\n* Sometimes it's not about ADDING something, but about ELIMINATING an offending ingredient. Try to identify what products and ingredients help your skin and which seem to make it worse. Sometimes acne can actually be irritation in disguise.\n\n* If starting a retinoid/rx medication/AHA, **USE SUNSCREEN**\n\n* Many ABers will swear by techniques and approaches that may seem counter-intuitive to the unintitiated, such as using oil cleansers as a first step, applying facial oils, and moisturizing the skin. People with oily skin general fear oils in most of their forms, so it can be difficult to feel comfortable applying oils to the face or moisturizing creams. That feeling is normal, feel free to try different suggestions and techniques depending on comfort level, but try to keep an open mind. \n\n* Check your make up application tools (brushes, Beauty Blender) - these may be a source of bacteria and mold that could be at the route of your skin problems. Make sure you wash these tools thoroughly and regularly and let dry completely between uses.\n\n* Sanitize your cell phone\n\n* Change your pillow case twice a week or use a t-shirt over your pillow\n\n* Use new face towel every day\n\n* Avoid picking or touching your face (hydrocolloid patches can help with this)\n\n* Practice positive affirmations\n\n* If you want to truly mimic how they do things in Korea, go see a dermatologist, especially one that specializes in aesthetic dermatology. Koreans are much more likely to see a dermatologist for even minor breakouts. Of course, accessibility and affordability are an issue for many, so of course, this may be easier said than done. \n\n* Get some sleep already!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDITORIAL COMMENT** This is the topic that is probably covered the most thoroughly here on Reddit, giving that the demographic likely skews younger. After reading through thousands of comments and posts on this topic, the major takeaway for the AB approach to acne is to use an Asian-style routine (double cleansing, multiple hydrating layers, gentle approach, use of whitening/brightening products that also have anti-inflammatory effects) in conjunction with prescription medications. Retinoid based treatments can be very harsh on the skin's moisture barrier, and lucky for those of us who are AB enthusiasts, we have multiple tools at our disposal to replenish lost hydration and provide the necessary occlusion to keep that moisture in the skin. While you can of course try maxing out your OTC exfoliation, the fastest route to clear skin is very likely going to be to see a dermatologist, and then using your AB routine to deal with the aftermath. **Many, many respondents have said that the single most effective change that cleared their acne was seeing a dermatologist**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Sources*\n\n[Acne prone ABers: What product has made the biggest difference in your acne](https://m.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/40rry9/acne_prone_abers_what_product_has_made_the/?ref=search_posts)\n\n[HG Products for Acne Scares Combination Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4f5u65/holy_grail_products_for_acne_scares_combination/)\n\n[What do Koreans use for acne?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4eew3q/what_do_koreans_use_for_acne/)\n\n[AB for Acne Prone Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3aehm0/asian_beauty_for_acneprone_dry_skin/)\n\n[For oily and acne-prone: do you use moisturizing toners?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4immov/for_oily_and_acne_prone_do_you_use_moisturizing/)\n\n[What's best for acne prone skin?

The hormonal imbalance causing acne may be a symptom of an underlying diagnosis that needs proper medical attention, or it could be that acne is the only symptom of that slight hormone imbalance but that disrupting those hormones via spearmint might lead to other problems e.g. menstrual cycle changes. People should speak to their doctor before self-medicating their hormones since they're responsible for a lot more than acne. Or you could [add this blog link](http://www.fanserviced-b.com/skincare-routine-for-hormonal-cystic-acne/) that has disclaimers in it to the list? You rock for putting this all together!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for curating this list of products and information! The amount of time it must have taken is incredible. I just wanted to add that, a few months ago, I created a post about [things and habits that keep my skin clear](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4cn3s9/simple_things_and_habits_ive_noticed_that_help/?ref=share&ref_source=link). I am more on the combo/acne side rather than oily/acne side... but the points I made and the comments added to that post are still very relevant and helpful for myself (as I imagine many other ABers who deal with acne). Here's the post:  \n>I was just looking over the sub, and although this post might not be totally AB-centric, it involves AB. A little background about me first:    \n  \n>&nbsp;  \n\n>I got into AB at the beginning of July last year (2015). You might remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3bospx/tomorrow_is_july_1st_i_am_making_a/?ref=share&ref_source=link) if you were involved in the community at the time. The point is, my skin likes to be babied. It doesn't like being poked, picked, scratched, rubbed, chafed, or abused. I've had acne since I was 12 years old. Yes, 12. I was still in 7th grade at that time. My acne was mild then, but it has noticeably progressed over the years, and became hormonal during high school (around my junior year, IIRC.) I always thought that using products that would dry my skin out would clear up my acne for good. I abided by Western skincare practices, and used an exfoliating face wash, astringent toner, and light moisturizer, followed by a benzoyl peroxide spot cream. If I didn't have a spot treatment, I would dab rubbing alcohol or tooth paste on my pimples. Did that type of routine work? Yeah, but only for the first week... and then my skin would become terribly dehydrated, flaky, sensitive, and red. I was on my high school swim team, and I would have practice every weekday for about 2 hours. As soon as I got out of the pool, I would reapply my makeup and go home instead of washing my face since I was so embarrassed of my acne. I would frequently sleep in my makeup and wouldn't wash my sheets more than once every two months. I would pick my skin almost daily, and then not wash my face after picking for sometimes hours. Basically, my skincare habits were terrible and unsanitary. I didn't consistently follow my routine, and I slept in my makeup.   \n  \n>So fast-forward a few years... I'm now in my early twenties and I have a well-established skincare routine that centers around AB and AB practices. The most clearly-defined Asian skincare practice being to keep my skin hydrated, even if it's oily. I follow my routine religiously, and when I don't, I sheet-mask or use an extra amount of my Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream ;) Since sticking with my routine, my acne has significantly cleared up and my skin has become brighter, glow-ier, and smoother.   \n   \n> &nbsp;  \n\n>**I just wanted to share with the community that I've noticed simple things over the past year or two that have immensely helped keep my skin clear. Here they are (finally):**   \n \n>* Do not pick, squeeze, scratch, or dig at your pimples or skin if you can help it    \n* Keep track of your progress with picking at your skin with an app; stay accountable for picking    \n* If you've got a pimple or whitehead that's about to pop or come out, wash your hands/sanitize them first and then LIGHTLY pop the pimple; immediately put a hydrocolloid bandage on it  \n* Keep your sheets (and especially your pillowcase) clean; wash them at least once or twice a month  \n* Do you morning skincare routine daily and don't skimp on the sunscreen    \n* Don't reapply powder makeup more than once in a day; instead, blot with a tissue or paper towel or toilet paper and then lightly swipe or dab over it with a makeup brush or sponge that has nothing on it to fix the finish  \n* If you wear makeup, wash it off nightly and continue with your nightly routine    \n* If you *really* can't do your entire routine, at the very least: cleanse with a cleansing water/wipe and put your active or prescription on followed by at least one moisturizer or emulsion  \n* Try to be cognizant of your hand placement during the day, and keep your hands away from your face as much as possible, especially if you haven't washed them or used hand sanitizer   \n* Research the ingredients in all the products you would like to buy BEFORE you buy them and take note of the ingredients your skin is sensitive to  \n* Write down your current routine somewhere and record your skin's progress using pictures, qualitative analysis, or quantitative analysis (by this, I mean count the number of pimples on your face at a point in time and record it) and try to determine whether or not your skin gets better or worse when a new product is introduced or an old product is thrown out  \n* Introduce only one new product at once, and use it for at least 2 weeks before introducing another new product (because who am I kidding? Patch-testing takes way too much patience when it comes to acne breakouts... if I breakout after a new non-active product has been introduced, I'll know the product doesn't work for me and I'll stop using it)  \n* Be patient with active products and prescription products; they can take weeks or months for your skin to adjust to, depending on their strengths; don't give up if they cause an initial purge or breakout  \n* Tailor your day-to-day moisturizing routine depending on how hydrated your skin feels   \n* Pay attention to your skin a day or two after using a sheet mask; if it looks like it's bright and clearer than usual, use another sheet mask that week; if it looks dull or the texture feels \"off,\" give your skin a breather and wait until the following week to use another sheet mask (YMMV for this one: I've noticed I get tiny whiteheads if I sheet mask too often in one week)  \n* Go to sleep around the same hour consistently and don't mess with your sleep schedule if you can help it; my skin breaks out when I don't have a regular sleeping schedule; try to get the same amount of rest every night (that could be 5 hours of sleep or 8 hours of sleep; just keep it CONSISTENT)  \n* Wipe down surfaces your face or hands touch regularly with a sanitizing wipe (phone, car steering wheel, hand sanitizer bottles, desks, laptops or cases, closet doors, handles, bathroom counters, etc.)    \n* Use prescription oral medications if your acne is hormonal (e.g. spironolactone, birth control, accutane, etc.)  \n* Can't emphasize this enough, but use sunscreen daily if you're going out (even to work or school)  \n  \n>---     \n\n>Suggestions from other users:    \n>\n* If you think your acne could be hormonal, make an appointment to see your doctor. Don't be stubborn like I was and needlessly suffer with acne. It has made a huge difference in my skin's texture, softness, and of course clarity. I wish I had started taking spironolactone years ago. (*from u/marmot33*)  \n* I would also like to add drinking lots of water, I noticed my skin gets very congested if I'm dehydrated (*from u/feverrayz*)    \n* washing sheets/pillowcases: You really should be doing this once a week, especially if you use hair products. So much dirt and oil builds up, not to mention sweat and facial products. My tip: flip your pillow over every night (clean side!) And change it once a week. And get some silk ones! You'll thank yourself when you're old like me. (*from u/misspiemisspoke*)  \n* If you're a chronic picker (like me) I'd recommend getting acrylic tips! They might not be for everyone, but I've found being physically unable to pick my skin is the only way I stop. Team no self-restraint over here haha. (*from u/AnthonyJCrawly*)  \n* instead of popping, get some lancets from a pharmacy. they're basically teeny scalpels and make a nice clean cut that heals better than the tear of a pop. lancet are about 8$for 100. (*from u/IWankYouWonk*)  \n* My tip: Wash your hands well before bed and if you put handcream on make sure that it's not something that will make you break out if you accidentally transfer some of it to your face while sleeping. (*from u/pennypoppet*)  \n* Something that I've found that works for me is also exercising. I go to the gym 5-6 times a week now and my skin has been noticeably clearer. It's usually clear, but I would get the occasional pimple. This has not happened since I starting gymming more frequently the last 3 months (*from u/AlphaBaby*)\n  \n>&nbsp;    \n\n>I probably have more somewhere stored deep in my brain but those are the suggestions that come to mind at the moment. Keep in mind, these are things that I've personally noticed over the last year that have improved my acne. I'm currently 85% clear and am in love with the texture and brightness of my complexion. I still have a little more progress to make with becoming totally clear, but compared to a year ago, my skin is doing fantastic and I couldn't be more grateful to this community and the wonderful source of knowledge its users have been :) All hail the snail!  \n   \n> &nbsp;    \n\n>*P.S. If you have any other simple tips you'd like me to add to the list, please leave them in the comments!*",

I struggled to picture this poor guy being a dumbo half-moon he was so clamped and small. Somehow the other was worse off. A friend of mine took the other home but the poor thing passed away in the night. \n\nWhen asked what color he was I would just say he's gray. Little guy was totally emaciated. He was too small to eat the food pellets they were giving him. Once home he developed stress ich. I raised the tank temperature to 80F. Soon after I left him a chunk of brine shrimp to nibble while I was at work (BIG MISTAKE). \n\nAfter a week of huge bloat issues that fasting wasn't helping, Iji developed dropsy. I ordered some tea tree oil thinking euthanasia was the most humane next step but gave him another day or two just to see. The very next morning, to my shock and horror, Iji had ruptured his stomach and relieved his bloat. He was cheerfully swimming around catching his fleas. I quickly researched as best I could and decided to medicate his water so he could heal if he wanted to. And he really wanted to! Ten days of dosing his water with melafix and fish amox. As a bonus Iji liked to eat the amox.\n\nBy day 10 of meds his hole was healed over with scales and everything. His color was back to developing. You'd never guess he had almost died several times in the last month!\n\nI've had a lot of people saying I should share his story if even just to document it for myself. He's made such a huge transformation and I can't wait to see how big his fins can grow. Fingers crossed that he doesn't have any more drama for at least a month or two!",

    "body": "I’m going to start off by saying I know it sounds crazy. I didn’t say anything for a long time because I thought, “no, you’re seeing connections where they aren’t. These are just popular things.” \n\nOur grocery store is pretty remote and has a fairly limited selection. They notoriously didn’t sell my brand of toilet paper, and after a few months of trying and hating their selection, I caved and ordered my brand on Amazon. About two months later they started carrying my brand in limited quantities. Win for me!\n\nI was looking for a specific brand of toddler squeeze pouch and they didn’t carry it, so again I ordered. Two months later, they carry it. Again, a win! But as time goes on I notice weird things that I’ve ordered that they start to carry after about two months. A particular brand of truffled hot sauce. Pickled peppercorns. A specific type of men’s conditioner (no other types of this brand, just the one tea tree oil for men.) Pea Flower tea. A bunch of sloth tea steepers (no other animal.) A hard to find Thai soy based sauce. Gatorlyte, but only initially in orange and purple (that was crazy popular so they’ve expanded into the other flavors, this one seems kinda inevitable but I only ordered orange and purple, the cherry one seems to sell more though.) Disposable and then reusable menstrual cups. A particular brand of baby wipes, not associated with anything else they sell baby wise. A particular brand of shave soap (the company offers many scents but they picked the two I ordered, lemongrass and bergamot, though online cedar seems to be the most popular.) Cocktail napkins. Pink butcher’s paper. The list goes on.\n\nFinally one day my SO notes that it’s really weird that we order stuff from Amazon and just a little bit later it seems to be in the store. A friend of mine found the pickled peppercorns and called me to say “I honestly don’t know anyone who even knows what these are besides you, and I know you ordered a ton, and now they’re just here on the shelf?” \n\nThe store struggles to maintain inventory. It is not a weird day or week to have no milk (cow or otherwise) no yogurt (dairy or otherwise) almost no frozen food, a struggling cleaning supply, but they have my fruit wash that I was ordering, and they now carry the sizes for my specific trash can/recycling combo made by the brand of trash can I bought. \n\nThere’s some sort of analytics exchange somewhere, right? I know I sound hung up on the pickled peppercorns, but no restaurant around me uses them. Most people I talk to don’t know what they are and don’t know what to do with them. But now in the middle of nowhere, after scouring all the big towns around me, they’re here?\n\nI don’t think I’m being stalked (good luck if I am, I’m incredibly boring) nor do I think I’m the pinnacle of taste on anything (except toilet paper, I’d probably fight on that one.) So in the words of Jerry Seinfeld, “what is the deal with my grocery store carrying my Amazon purchases?!”\n\nETA: it’s a commissary in a foreign country. Basically one of the only places to buy American foodstuffs. Neighbors have mentioned buying regional brands from the states only to see them show up in the store shortly after.",

No one is actively sharing data, no one is 'listening in on your conversations through your phone speaker'.\n\nHere's the example I use when explaining this to someone who said \"Why am I seeing ads for bicycles?  I didn't search for it, I didn't browse for it, but I did have a conversation with my friend about bicycles!  My phone is listening to me!\"\n\nNo, it isn't.\n\nBut big data can draw some conclusions.  Your phone and your friends phone are frequently in the same space.  You obviously are friends, so you probably share some interests.  Your friend recently did some research on bikes.  Chances are, you and he may be interested in bikes, so lets show you some bike ads too.\n\nThis is how big data works.  When every move, every click, every view, every trip, every activity is tracked, logged, and stored, deep analysis can figure out just about anything.  And they're very very good at it.\n\nNow, in your particular case.  You've ordered that stuff on Amazon.  Your phone has been in that store many times.  Big Data knows that you are a customer of that store, and you're interested int hat product.  The store gets recommendations for \"Things your customers may be interested in\".  \n\nBang, your product shows up in the store.\n\nWelcome to the modern age.",

We do have a cat (spayed female, no spraying, good bathroom habits) and two German Shepherds (male and female, both fixed) but they're not allowed in that room and I can't find any discolored areas with my UV flashlight. The house is just a year old, I clean every week and that room just has a desk and coffee table in it.\n\nThings I've used that have not helped at all:\n\nLeaving baking soda in the carpet for several days and vacuuming\n\nSprinkling drops of tea tree oil in the carpet\n\nWhite vinegar\n\nEnzyme sprays\n\nDisinfectant sprays\n\nCharcoal odor absorbers\n\nScented candles\n\nI'm at a total loss and can't stand to be in the room due to the smell. I've checked for weird-smelling plants outside the window but there aren't any. What else can I do?\n\n(Edit to add that the room was fine, I left for a weekend and when I came home I first noticed the smell.)\n\nEdit 2: Thanks everybody, I really appreciate all the helpful comments. To answer a few questions: No previous owners, we built the house and moved in a year ago. Standalone so we don't share any walls with neighbors. No plants inside the house.\n\nEdit 3: There's one air vent in the ceiling, none on the floor/walls.\n\nEdit 4: I have a very sensitive nose and my husband can't even smell the pee smell. We don't use anything with fragrance, no scented detergent or anything, with the exception of the aforementioned essential oil and candle, so it's not like the smell is being masked in other parts of the house, it's just concentrated in this one room.",

    "body": "\\*disclaimer: All of this is just my own experience and your mileage may vary. By cystic acne I mean the deep, painful bumps (\"blind\" pimples) that never come to a head\n\nWhen I turned 25 I started getting deep, painful cysts on my chin, and I’ve probably read every single post on this subreddit related to cystic acne. I have finally found a solution that works for me. \n\n**The Method:**\n\nDo this as soon as you feel a “blind”, deep zit forming under the skin (even if you can’t see it or it doesn’t hurt yet). Before bed, prepare and drink a cup of chamomile tea (I use Bigelow Sweet Dreams tea). After you are done with the warm tea bag, press and hold it to the zit for about 30 seconds to a minute. Repeat nightly as needed. \n\nThat’s it! Without fail this makes the zit noticeably smaller and less painful within 1-2 nights. Typically within 3-4 nights I stop treating it altogether because I don't need to anymore! And this is for cysts that would typically be painful and inflamed for weeks. \n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Warm compresses weren’t working for me initially, and I figured out it was because I wasn’t being gentle enough. The tea bag should be comfortably warm but not too hot, otherwise it will just irritate things more. \n* Similarly, hold the tea bag gently against the skin but do not press too hard. This will just make it worse.\n* I’ve tried this for whiteheads too and it can be useful for drawing them to a head, but this method is much more effective for cystic acne\n* Using chamomile tea as opposed to a different tea is important and doing it before bed is most effective for me. Sometimes I also do a morning round of this treatment or try ginger green tea, but it doesn’t seem to work as well\n* Do not touch the zit at all the rest of the day. \n* This can be drying to the skin, especially after multiple nights in a row, so it’s important to moisturize. I like La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 for when skin gets flaky \n* Usually some pigmentation is left behind for weeks even after the cyst has flattened out, but that’s very easy to cover up with makeup. I like Clinique Redness Solutions Makeup\n\n**My experience with other solutions I have tried:** \n\nHydrocolloid bandages\n\n* This is the one other semi-useful treatment I’ve tried. These are supposed to be for white heads but some people swear they are useful for cysts, too. It might just be that having one on keeps you from touching/picking. Note: Zit stickers with “spikes” to penetrate deeper, like Zisticka, have not been useful and have just made my zits even more irritated. \n\nCold compresses/ice\n\n* This has never worked for me at all, and the cold seems to “firm up” the cyst even more for some reason. It seems to be heat that does the trick. \n\nCortisone Shot from a dermatologist\n\n* I did this once for a particularly bad cyst and had good results, but this is in no way a long term solution for something that happens regularly. I would recommend this in an emergency- like if it’s right before your wedding- but the tea bag method makes it so my cysts don’t ever get big enough for this to be necessary! \n\nTretinoin\n\n* I had already been on Tret .05% for a year when I started getting these cysts, so this hasn’t been a solution. Maybe my cystic acne would have been worse if I wasn't on Tret, though.\n\nAzelaic acid\n\n* I have been using prescription azelaic acid (finacea) for about a year (which is also supposed to be more effective combined with tret). I can’t really say whether or not it helps with the cysts. I definitely still get them.\n\nRosehip Oil\n\n* Is supposed to reduce redness and help with cystic acne. This wasn’t particularly useful for me, and I’m in fact wary of this making my oily T-Zone even worse by putting an oil on it. I do put rosehip oil on my cheeks every night because I don’t get acne there, and it’s very moisturizing. \n\nDiet\n\n* I had been eating a whole food plant based (vegan) diet for about a year when I started getting these cysts, so a healthy diet unfortunately did not protect me. I tried a completely oil free/fat free vegan diet for a few weeks when my cystic acne was particularly bad (look up Nina and Randa Nelson) but this didn’t noticeably help, and also wasn’t sustainable long term for me. I do recommend eating a whole food plant based diet for skin and general health (dairy is supposed to be particularly bad for acne), but it’s not a cure all. I definitely treat myself occasionally to dessert/fast food, and my skin is overall very clear, so I think for most people it’s really not necessary to eat perfectly. \n\nSpearmint tea/spearmint capsules\n\n* Spearmint is supposed to have an anti-androgen effect that prevents cysts. I tried this for several weeks and I’m not sure this was helping at all, and even if it was I don’t like spearmint tea enough to commit to drinking it every single day long term. I similarly don’t want to commit to buying spearmint pills for the rest of my life. This does seem to work for some people, though. \n\nRed Light therapy\n\n* I have a red light that I sit in front of sometimes because it’s supposed to reduce inflammation. I have no idea if it helps or not, and is definitely not a solution for my \\`cystic acne.\n\nDermatologist\n\n* My experience going to a dermatologist about my cystic acne wasn’t good. He recommended I go on antibiotics (amoxycyllin), but I didn’t view this as a long term solution because I expected the acne would just come back after the antibiotics were over. He also prescribed me a topical antibiotic (clindamycin), which would probably help with white heads but isn’t useful for the deep cysts I was regularly getting.\n\nPillowcases/Laundry\n\n* I switched to satin pillowcases and I wash them every single week using a hypoallergenic laundry detergent (seventh generation free and clear). I dry them using dryer balls instead of dryer sheets so that they don’t get coated in wax. I can’t say whether this is making a difference or not, but I’d recommend giving it a try. \n\n**Things I’ve tried for cystic acne that were totally ineffective:**\n\n* Sulfur ointment\n* Tea tree oil\n* Salicylic acid (does’t work for deep cysts)\n* Benzoyl peroxide (doesn’t work for deep cysts)\n* Aztec healing clay\n* Hemorrhoid cream\n* Diaper rash cream\n* Both prescription strength and drugstore hydrocortisone\n* Basically I recommend just not bothering with anything topical for deep cysts. None of these things made any difference",

Luckily I had some Chamomile tea my mom gave me for stress 😁\n\nI brewed the tea, placed the warm (not hot) bag on the cyst and kept it there long after it was cool. Then drank the tea slowly and afterwards took the cold tea bag and applied it again for a number of minutes. Then wiped it clean and applied moisturizer. \n\nI repeated this am and pm for 3 days. By Monday my cyst was almost completely gone except for the discoloration that they often leave. But make-up sorted that out.

Honestly zitstickas HAVE worked well for me (to my surprise); I think it’s something about having it covered for long periods of time so the skin isn’t touched or exposed to other things. I use the “killa” orange zit stickas for deep pimples like as SOON as I feel them forming (sometimes before they are even visible at all) overnight and even during the day sometimes when I have no shame lol. Other little pimple covers of any brand have worked pretty well once zits start coming to a head. \n\nAlso, I’ve made sure to keep my skin well moisturized which I think I neglected in the past (sounds so simple, but maybe I thought of oil clogging pore more than dry skin.. but dry skin does the exact same thing and causes acne). I love using aquaphor on my lips— no other scented chapsticks or anything — and also not afraid to dab a little aquaphor on blemishes near my mouth and nose.\n\nAfter so many years of desperately trying so many things, I think we try to doctor our skin a little too much and end up just irritating it.

Check out the new and vastly improved version here:***\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/1bs7nv/the_redditors_guide_to_acne_2013/\n\n---\n\nNote: I read every comment, and I am also regularly editing based on feedback. Please continue to contribute your questions and suggestions, and they will hopefully be addressed either with a response from me, or in updates to the guide. At no point will I consider this complete, so if there are more sections you want to see, or points you want some elaboration on, let me know.\n\n-------\nMost of us have gotten a lot of useful life tips from reddit, and it’s certainly a great source of collective knowledge on many topics. But there’s one thing that I’ve noticed people here are not good at: acne. The best we’ve managed as a collective is \"put a clean towel on your pillow every night\". But in reality, there is no cure, and no one simple thing is going to change that. Acne is caused and helped by different things for different people. Dirty skin is not likely to be the real cause, so slight hygiene improvements can only help so much. Generally speaking, what works for someone else won't work for you, and sometimes most of the things that SHOULD work don't. I know how frustrating that is, having tried numerous products over the past few years, and finding that even the best ones don't help, or lead to more problems. It's made especially hard because the Internet is filled with misinformation and ignorance about how to treat acne, and it can be nearly impossible for most people to distinguish the good advice from the baseless crap that makes up 90% of acne-related websites. \n\nI've tried to extract the useful information from all this, approaching the problem from various angles rather than recommending a specific product or regimen. Despite what people in almost every reddit acne thread keep telling you (and there has been a lot of awful advice in those threads), there is no miracle product or easy fix. You need to understand a lot more about skin care and acne before you can understand how to treat your own problems, and what you do will depend on your skin type and the nature of your acne.\n\n**Basic Acne Treatment**\n\nBefore continuing, I suggest reading [this](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/best-acne-fighting-products.aspx) summary of acne, its causes, and most of the treatments available for it. [Acne.org](http://www.acne.org/), though questionable at times, is worth reading through for more info. It also has user reviews of every product, home remedy and other treatment, both internal and external. [This thread](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/index.php/topic/102347-biggest-mistakes-people-make-to-treat-acne/) addresses a lot of the common mistakes you may be making. The forums CAN provide useful information like that, but be careful, as there's also a lot of unreliable advice and anecdotes. Remember, what works for someone else may not work for you, and sometimes people make mistakes when assessing their own results.\n\nYou can get a reasonable amount of detail from those links (and more from checking Wikipedia/Google results for anything listed there), and I suggest reading them before this FAQ. I'm just going to summarise the pros and cons of some common acne treatments. (You can see a fairly comprehensive list [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Acne_agents).)\n\n*Benzoyl Peroxide (BP)*\n\n* Examples: [Acne.org](http://www.danielkern.com/product-p/treatment-8.htm), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/product/clear-acne-fighting-treatment/acne-treatment-clear-skin), [Serious Skin Care](http://www.seriousskincare.com/product_p/clearzitnano.htm) (5% only, but no other product effectively combines benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil), [Oxy](http://www.oxyskincare.com/our-products/oxy-clinical-clearing-treatment/) (5% only), [ProActiv](http://www.proactiv.com)\n\nPros:\n\n* Kills acne bacteria better than anything else you can get OTC, strong support from studies.\n* Also has some keratolytic effects due to its skin peeling properties, so it can clear pores.\n* Widely available and commonly used, relative to comparable products.\n\nCons:\n\n* Dries out skin\n* High sun sensitivity (use sunscreen)\n* Bleaches clothes and sheets\n* It can be harsh, irritating and drying: many people will have some kind of negative reaction, and those who are allergic or have sensitive skin can't tolerate it at all. (I don't use BP for this reason. If you do, I recommend trying a 2.5% product, as stronger ones have worse side effects, and there's little evidence that they're more effective.)\n\n*Salicylic Acid / Beta Hydroxy Acid / BHA*\n\nExamples: [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/category/bha-aha-exfoliants), [Neutrogena](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/oil-free+acne+stress+control-+3-in-1+hydrating+acne+treatment.do)\n\nPros:\n\n* Best exfoliant: helps remove dead skin and encourage new growth, which both prevents pore blocking and improves hyperpigmentation (red/dark marks).\n* Unclogs pores and restores them to their healthy size/funtion, excellent for blackheads/whiteheads.\n* Anti-inflammatory.\n* Can and should be spread all over the face to improve appearance and smoothness, not just as a spot treatment.\n\nCons:\n\n* Sun sensitivity (always use sunscreen!)\n* Still can't be used by some, especially if you have an aspirin allergy or salicylate sensitivity\n\n*Other Exfoliant Info*\n\n* Alpha Hydroxy Acids (usually glycolic or lactic acid) are an alternative if your skin can't tolerate BHAs, but do not penetrate as deep into the skin, so they don't work as well against acne (but they do help with surface damage).\n* Physical scrubs only exfoliate superficially, not penetrating the skin like AHAs/BHAs, and their abrasive nature also means they can be more irritating (and more likely to accidentally scrub pimples), so these are not recommended. If you are going to go with a scrub, try to make it a fairly gentle one, or just use a washcloth with your cleanser.\n* I don't want to advocate specific brands for the most part, but most BHA products have too high a pH to exfoliate, or contain ingredients that make acne worse. Good ones are hard to find, so I would recommend getting them from Paula's Choice. They're the only brand that has a few different products with varying strengths (1%/2%) and bases (liquid/gel/lotion), so you can find the right fit for your skin type.\n* Start by using them once a day, at night, and if necessary, adjust the frequency based on how your skin responds.\n\n*Tea Tree Oil*\n\nPros:\n\n* [Functionally comparable to benzoyl peroxide.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2145499) \n* Doesn't have the drying or irritating side effects of BP\n\nCons:\n\n* Weaker than BP; takes longer to work and may have a lower success rate.\n* Lack of good tea tree products available, most are unlikely to be effective. \n* Highly volatile, may lose effectiveness from exposure to light or air. Be careful with the below method; buy small quantities and store it carefully.\n\nThe best way to get around the poor availability of good products is to buy 100% tea tree oil, and dilute it to 5% (i.e. 1:19) concentration in a carrier oil, such as jojoba. (Camellia oil and grape seed oil are a couple touted for their skin benefits, but I'm not sure if they block pores.) A few drops of jojoba can double as a light, noncomedogenic moisturiser, suitable even for oily skin. You don't really want to be using creams and lotions on oily skin anyway, as they risk making it oilier or clogging pores. I wouldn't rush to add TTO to other skin products, unless you just mix them in your hands before application. \n\nA similar product, called manuka oil, is made from a New Zealand plant (usually used to make a highly antibacterial honey), rather than the Australian tea tree. I haven't heard much about this being used for acne, but if anyone has tried it, let me know how it went. It's possible that this is just as effective as tea tree, or more so, but either it's obscure because of the lack of studies on it, or has so few studies on it because it's obscure.\n\n*Azelaic Acid*\n\nPros:\n\n* Combines some of the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and exfoliant/pore-clearing effects of the above products (I believe you need sunscreen with it for similar reasons).\n* Generally well-tolerated, usable on sensitive skin.\n* Very effective for hyperpigmentation left behind by acne (currently considered a possible safer alternative to hydroquinone for skin lightening)\n\nCons:\n\n* Poor availability: Whether it's OTC or prescription-only varies with the country. So far, the only place I know for certain it's OTC is Australia, where you can get the 20% lotion (Azclear) or 15% gel (Finacea). Some online stores will ship these internationally. I wasn't really sure whether this belonged here or in the prescription treatment section, but if you do reach the point of needing prescription topicals, this is a really good one to try anyway.\n* Some people may have bad side effects, especially in the first couple of weeks. I find it needs to be followed with a moisturiser.\n* Relative lack of research into its usage, effectiveness and precautions. Generally speaking, fewer people seem to have used it, so it's hard to assess how good it is.\n\nRemember that any of these will most likely take several weeks to start working, as acne that is already forming can take some time to come to the surface. If you want to know where to start, I suggest salicylic acid (or an AHA), then if it doesn't do enough on its own, try combining it with tea tree oil or BP. Azelaic acid is a great alternative, if you can get access to it. If these fail, you may want to see a doctor or dermatologist for stronger options. Before you do any of this, though, I recommend reading through the next few sections that cover how to look after your health, hygiene and skin in a way that will minimise your acne, which may save you needing to go further or spend more money.\n\n(Continued in the comments.)",

        "body": "**Skin Care**\n\nSo, you heard from someone (or from reddit) that Product X fixed all their problems, or you saw an ad that seemed like the answer to all your problems, or something just caught your eye on a store shelf. The first thing you want to know is if the product's claims are true, or just marketing bullshit. I would typically look it up on [Beautypedia](http://www.beautypedia.com/) first, which gives you an ingredient list and a basic assessment of those ingredients. (I'd love to include other comprehensive professional review sites here to account for possible bias/error, but I don't think there are any.) There are also a lot of options for [searching](http://www.beautypedia.com/AdvancedSearch.aspx) based on your skin type, the type of product you're looking for, and even particular ingredients you want or don't want, giving you a list of options to check out. If the brand you're looking for isn't there (more likely if you're outside America), you can look up ingredients on [Cosmetics Cop](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/A.aspx), which summarises most known info and studies on skin care ingredients. Sites like [Cosmeticsinfo.org](http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/) and [Personal Care Truth](http://personalcaretruth.com/) can complement this nicely if you want more in-depth scientific analysis, or just more information on something you're unsure of.\n\nI won't recommend specific brands or products, because really, while a certain one may work very well for a particular person, there is no \"special\" one. You just have to experiment. No product is unique, as the same ingredients can usually be found elsewhere. Also, every brand has both good and bad products, so you do need to check the specific stuff you're using rather than getting your entire regimen from one line.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, but MAKE SURE YOUR ACNE IS NOT BEING WORSENED BY ANY OF YOUR SKIN CARE PRODUCTS. So many people start with minimal acne, but they respond to it with bad products, which block pores or irritate their skin, leading them into a cycle of worse and worse acne. And yes, anything can be doing this - it doesn't matter if it says \"non-comedogenic\", \"hypoallergenic\", or \"natural\", as these terms aren't strictly defined or regulated. They're basically marketing lingo made to convince you that you're getting something \"safe\". While acne's primary cause is hormonal, many other things can exacerbate it by blocking pores or causing irritation that leads to increased sebum production. If you have sensitive skin, just about anything could be a culprit, especially cleansers. You can also save yourself a lot of time in checking new products by making sure they include none of the ingredients listed [here](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/skin-irritation-your-worst-enemy.aspx). These are less of a concern at the end of the ingredients list, though, as this implies a very small quantity. The first thing you should do if you think there may be a problem with your current products is to stop using anything containing [fragrance](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mjl/adv/2007/00000087/00000004/art00005), probably the most common cause of reactions that is unfortunately used very frequently.\n\n*Basic Skin Care Routine* \n\nThis is just a term I'm using to define, basically, a springboard from which you can modify and add products and steps as you experiment with your acne treatment. This really consists of three things that you need to get down before you start introducing anti-acne products and experimenting with other additions and substitutions. The idea is to start by using as few things on your skin as possible, then slowly adding more to see how they affect your skin.\n\nHere's what you need:\n\n* A gentle cleanser suited for your skin type. Avoid harsh, irritating/drying detergent cleansing agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate. Most of the others are considered less irritating, but there are some, like sodium laureth sulfate, that may be a bad idea for very sensitive skin. Note that an anti-acne cleanser is not necessary, and probably not even very effective, as the best anti-acne products need to be left on your skin to really work. Pick gentle/sensitive skin cleansers over acne-focused ones. Preferably don't use a bar soap, as many of these risk drying, irritating or blocking pores.\n* A toner or light moisturiser, depending on whether your skin is dry enough to need a moisturiser. If you have combination skin, you should treat the dry and oily areas differently. If you use a toner, make sure it doesn't contain alcohol or any other irritants. A toner has the benefit of not risking blocking pores. Jojoba oil is also a popular alternative. I find the easiest way to treat oily skin is to only apply a very thin layer of moisturiser (something like CeraVe or acne.org's moisturiser, or anything without oils in it).\n* Sunscreen (also covered in another section). This can and should be included in your moisturiser during the day, but not at night, so you may need two different moisturisers. (Note that there are moisturisers with sunscreen specifically for oily skin.)\n\nRemember, breakouts usually don't happen overnight, as acne can take weeks to form below the surface. This makes it very hard to actually identify whether something new is helping or hurting, so you may need to use something for a few weeks and see what happens. While a good product will take time to work, don't be fooled by claims of \"purging\". If you get *worse*, i.e. breaking out immediately from something new, stop using it.\n\n*Shaving* (for men)\n\nA lot of shaving products and aftershaves contain irritants, as well as razors themselves. The trend of adding more and more blades has really led to more irritating shaves, which isn't helped by the fact that these blades encourage you to rush and to push too hard on the skin. Two blades will lead to fewer problems than five blades. Better yet, though, check out /r/wicked_edge and get yourself a double edge safety razor. (I use an Edwin Jagger DE89BL, but see that subreddit for more details on everything you need and how to use it.) Learning how to shave in a totally new way takes some getting used to, but gives you much more precise control, and a smoother, gentler shave. It's also much cheaper. A good thing to remember is that if you have acne, you should never shave against the grain, as this is a major cause of irritation and ingrown hairs.\n\nJust be wary of the fact that most shaving soaps/creams contain fragrance, menthol, [essential oils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Essential_oils) or other irritants, which should all be avoided. To make matters more frustrating, many do not list ingredients online. Evidently, many people who make shaving products either know shit all about actual skin care, or just don't particularly care about sensitive skin (for which fragrance-free products are a must). There are some good suggestions for things to try in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/ly4mo/are_there_any_good_fragrancefree_shaving_soaps/).\n\n**Sun** \n\nSunscreen is important, and relevant here because skin that is healing from acne is highly susceptible to discolouration and damage that can cause it to age more quickly. This applies every day and all year round, not just in summer. Pretty much every really effective acne treatment increases sun sensitivity, including salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and even oral antibiotics (tetracyclines), so this is a particularly big deal for acne sufferers, and people who no longer have acne but want the redness left behind to heal.\n\nThis may seem straightforward enough, but for acne-prone skin, sunscreen is actually one of the hardest things to get right. Many of them are too thick to use on your face, and if you have sensitive skin, chemical sunscreens (i.e. the vast majority) can be problematic. In that case you would want a physical/mineral sunscreen, with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, but these are the most likely to block pores. Hopefully you won't have to rely on those. (Some of us are less lucky.) A spray or gel can be good for oily skin, but many of these are alcohol-based. What you most likely want is either a very light sunscreen, or a moisturiser with sunscreen that is made for oily skin.\n\nStaying out of the sun to avoid sun damage is also pretty good for your skin. That's right, there are benefits to being a forever alone shut-in spending all day on reddit! (UV rays pass through windows, though, so close your blinds.) Uh, just make sure you take a vitamin D supplement if you're going to do that. Actually, speaking of which...",

On the other hand, I feel like I have something to bring to light that you have left out.\n\nThere has been a decent amount of experimentation recently with lower-than-traditional doses of accutane.  We are learning that many people are able to substantially (or entirely) clear their skin with dosages less than half of what is normally prescribed.\n\nI, myself, am an example.  At 160 pounds, I would usually be prescribed anywhere from 35mg to 75mg per day (or even more).  However, I have achieved and maintained a clear face with no more than one pimple every couple of months by taking a single 20mg pill every other day (10mg daily dosage).\n\nThe true benefit to low dosages is not just the reduced cost, but the reduced side effects.  After all, the most common reason that I see people avoid accutane is because of these side effects.  Fortunately, with low dosages they are almost always very tolerable.  Personally, the only thing I have experienced is chapped lips.  I'll trade that for clear skin any day.\n\nThe actual dosage that's necessary seems to vary significantly from person to person.  I have seen even less than 5mg per day have a significant effect on some people.  I am not an expert on the product, but I don't see anything wrong with a person experimenting to find the lowest dosage that will work for them, instead of simply going full dosage or nothing.",

Up to you whether or not to leave that coating on for a while or rinse it off, but it worked very well for me.\n\nAlso, use only glycerin soap (or something equally gentle and not full of fake crap). I liked this Aveeno oatmeal bar I had once. And...wash in the morning, upon getting up, and once at night. Maybe just once a day. (Don't wash your face like a crazy person - does more harm than good.)\n\nChanging pillowcases and diet obviously help too.

I read in the newspaper an article from Ann Landers back when she was alive that recommended separating the egg whites from the yolks and spreading the yolk to the affected area.  After it dried, you cleaned it off.  As far as I could tell there were no side effects (no chemicals) besides the gross factor.  It took a few applications, but in a few days my back was cleared up.  May not be useful long term but worked great for me.  Doesn't hurt to try it unless you are allergic to eggs.",

    "body": "**Why Skincare Matters (Especially in India)**\n\nIf you think skincare is unimportant, you’re wrong. Every man you idolize online — actors, influencers, athletes — all do some form of skincare (and even makeup sometimes). It’s not “girly” or “sigma” or whatever cringe label people throw around. It’s just hygiene and self-care.\n\nWhy is skincare extra important for Indian guys?\n\t•\tWeather: Sweaty summers, dry winters, crazy humidity — our skin suffers.\n\t•\tPollution: Indian cities = dust, dirt, and pollution constantly clogging your pores.\n\t•\tGenetics: Indian skin is more prone to acne scars, pigmentation, and tanning.\n\t•\tSun Exposure: UV index here is brutal. Skipping sunscreen will make you look like an old leather bag at 30.\n\nTL;DR — Take care of your skin now or regret it later.\n\n\n\n**Skincare Routine for Beginners**\n\n**Before we start**: Identify Your Skin Type & Concern\n\nFirst things first — figure out:\n\t•\tSkin Type: Dry, Oily, Combination, or Normal?\n\t•\tMain Concerns: Acne? Dull skin? Pigmentation? Uneven tone?\n\n**Golden Rule:** Always buy products based on your skin type and concerns — not random Instagram trends.\nIf possible, visit a dermatologist once to get a proper analysis.\n\n**Daily Routine**\n\n**Step 1: Cleanser (AM/PM)**\n\t•\tWash face with a gentle cleanser (like CeraVe).\n\tPM Tip: If you use sunscreen (which you should), double cleanse at night —\n\t1.\tFirst, wipe face with micellar water (like Bioderma).\n\t2.\tThen, cleanse with face wash.\n\t•\tOn extra sweaty/dirty days, I swap my PM cleanser with a Salicylic Acid Cleanser (like Minimalist).\n\n**Step 2: Toner (Optional, AM)**\n\t•\tAfter cleansing, pat face dry with a clean face towel.\n\t•\tUse toner only if needed — for dry skin, I use TONYMOLY Ceramide Mochi Toner. Most people can skip this.\n\n**Step 3: Targeted Serums (AM/PM)**\n\nSerums = Targeted treatment for specific concerns. Choose based on your needs:\n\t•\tHydration: Hyaluronic Acid\n\t•\tBrightening: Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Kojic Acid\n\t•\tExfoliation (2x a week): Glycolic Acid\n\t•\tAcne Treatment: Salicylic Acid, Tea Tree Oil\n\nWhat I use:\n\t•\tAM: Vitamin C (daily)\n\t•\tPM: Salicylic Acid (3x/week) & Glycolic Acid (2x/week)\n\n**Step 4: Moisturizer (AM/PM)**\n\t•\tAfter serum, always moisturize.\n\t•\tI use:\n\t•\tCetaphil DAM (for normal to dry skin)\n\t•\tBioderma Atoderm Crème Ultra (heavy-duty)\n\n**Step 5: Sunscreen (AM only — non-negotiable)**\n\t•\tFor dry/normal skin: Cream-based sunscreen\n\t•\tFor oily/combination skin: Gel-based sunscreen\n\t•\tMinimum: SPF 50 + PA+++\n\nI use UV Doux Gel Sunscreen — works well, non-sticky.\nAvoid influencer hype brands. Stick to reliable drugstore options.\n\n\n**Haircare Routine**\n\n\n**Step 1: Shampoo**\n\t•\tFrequency depends on sweat/dirt. Generally, 2x a week works.\n\t•\tUse sulfate & paraben-free shampoo.\n\t•\tPersonally, for my thick, wavy hair, only L’Oréal Professional Range shampoos make my scalp feel truly clean.\n\n**Step 2: Conditioner**\n\t•\tEvery time you shampoo, follow it up with conditioner.\n\n**Step 3: Leave-in Conditioner / Hair Serum**\n\t•\tNot mandatory, but if you have dry hair, it’s a game-changer.\n\n**Step 4: Hair Mask (Optional)**\n\t•\tFor very dry/damaged hair, use a mask once a week.\n\n\n\n**Grooming Essentials**\n\n**Lip Care**\n\t•\tAM: Apply Nivea Original Care lip balm.\n\t•\tPM: Use plain old Vaseline or Boroline before bed.\n\n**Shaving (for clean-shaven guys)**\n\t•\tUse a good razor —  I use the Gillette Fusion 5 Power.\n\t•\tShaving foam? Try Gillette Charcoal Foam (cooling effect is elite).\n\t•\tAfter shave, apply an after shave lotion followed by a moisturizer.\n\n**Beard Care (for my beard bros)**\n\t•\tGet a good quality Philips Trimmer (adjustable heads are clutch for styling).\n\n**Body Grooming**\n\t•\tGet a ceramic blade trimmer for body hair.\n\t•\tAlso, invest in a nose/ear trimmer (trust me — game changer).\n\n**Extra Hygiene Tips**\n\nDeo/Roll-on\n\t•\tMy picks: Nivea Maxx Fresh or Rexona Men or Chemist at Play 5% AHA (for dark pits)\n\nOral Hygiene\n\t•\tFloss before brushing. Brush for 2 mins. Use a tongue cleaner. Follow up with a mouthwash.\n\nSmelling Good\n\t•\tMix a few drops of Plum body oil into your body lotion.\n\t•\tOr invest in a good perfume (r/DesiFragranceAddicts has great recos).\n\n**Final Advice**\n\nSkincare & grooming aren’t “cringe” — they’re basic self-respect.\nTake care of yourself and you’ll naturally feel more confident. Whether you’re trying to impress your crush, glow up for college, or just feel good in your own skin - you may even end up getting the baddie too😉\n\nNeed product recos? You can head over to r/IndianSkincareAddicts .\n\n**I know my personal routine might seem expensive for a lot of teenagers, and trust me, I get it. But I’ve chosen to invest in myself because I see it as a long-term investment in my confidence and appearance. That being said, you absolutely don’t need to spend this much to build a solid routine. There are plenty of budget-friendly products that work just as well, especially if you focus on the basics — cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Skincare doesn’t have to break the bank.**",

    "body": "update3: Dog looks fine, nothing unusual. He's playful, hungry and excited about everything as usual. I think I avoided damage by washing him straight away, probably the dose wasn't too high too. Had a hard talk with the wife, obviously. She feels bad about it and understands this was reckless behavior.\n\nThanks for the help, everybody. Sorry for not responding to everyone, I didn't expect it to blow up like this.\n\nUpdate2: I did a long bath together with him, lots of water, lots of shampoo. Didn't use dish soap because I didn't read it in the comments before heading to the shower. Again, used a lot of shampoo and water, so I hope it's ok.  \nI called the vet hospital, but the guy who answered me didn't sound like he knew what he was talking about, he didn't even know what tea tree oil is. My main vet is not answering the emergency number for some reason.\n\nI guess I'm gonna white night it and look out for any signs, tomorrow I'm at the vet for a rabies shot anyway.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate: calling the emergency vet, thanks for the help, gonna update.\n\nLong story short, I told her to stop doing this stupid hippie shit, she did it anyway while I was out for 5 minutes. Rubbed him with this stuff and coconut oil too. I look for it online and find out she basically rubbed poison all over him.\n\nShe wiped him with a wet towel, but his coat is still a bit oily. He was licking his legs and probably other parts before she wiped him.\n\nWhat should I do? Give him a shower? Take him to the emergency vet? Just keep an eye on him? It's 12AM, I won't notice if something happens to him while I sleep.",

THEN begin adding warm water in small amounts until everything is well soaked. Spend time using your hands to scrub the hair well. Keep adding more and more water as you scrub. Eventually, you'll have done what you could, so then use your hands to squeegee the suds off, then rinse well.\n\n*I learned this method out of desperation when I made a Dracula costume for my 5 year old son to go trick'er treating. I didn't have any Dippity Doo (yeah, I'm that old) on hand, so I coated his hair thoroughly in Vaseline. Oops. But the hair looked perfect and held up great for duration (just sayin'). \n\nFast forward to washing it out before bed. Oh man, I literally washed that poor little guy's head 12 times before giving up. I dried it with a blow dryer and then had the epiphany about coating the hair with the shampoo first. I did that, and it worked great. Hallelujah!\n\nSo to add one last bit: I've since had to use this trick a few times over the year, for reasons not quite as stupid as Dracula hair.

    "body": "**You WILL mog them.**\n\nThe ultimate and attainable tips, based on (scientific) evidence, and experience (by myself and others). Tips that actually work, for once.\n\n*!!!! Obviously mewing, nose-breathing and having a fit body by eating healthy foods (amongst a snack from time to time, as long as you don't survive on them!) and moving/working out everyday belong on this list too, but I feel like those always speak for themselves when it comes to posts like these. !!!!!*\n\nThis is a comment that I posted under some boy his \"mog\" picture (he asked if he was mogging, I had to look up what it was and now I get it and really like the word), and I left some tips. I have many family members who are insiders in the beauty business, and almost all of these tips WORK. **Based on real life experience (of both myself and others) and scientific evidence.** I read what \"looksmaxxing\" meant today, and realized I have been doing this for years, tried all the tricks, found out the ones that worked, and received amazing benefits from those. If you want advice on something about your body you want to improve, there is a big chance I have a tip for even the most unique \"problems\", so feel free to ask. Although most people don't realize that their \"problems\" often go unnoticed by others. I encourage self-love and acceptance. But I do understand wanting to \"looksmaxx\" for societal benefits.\n\n**Anyways, this was my comment:**\n\nI hope you don't mind but here are some tips, coming from a girl who is seasoned in this and has tried all kinds of things (and believe me, us girls are hard fucking core at this stuff). I know all kinds of tips to better your appearance, and for me it has worked so well that I even got scouted by a modelling agency. I also had guy friends told me my skincare, hair of fashion advice really helped them. I hope I don't sound braggy, just naming my credentials. You have great potential! :)\n\nHere they are:\n\n\\- **Buy the Ordinary lash and brow serum.** I am serious. **Even as a guy.** It works wonders, isn't too expensive, lasts long and doesn't have the harmful stuff in it that prematurely ages your eyes. If you find it embarrassing to buy it, don't tell people about it and tell the cashier to wrap it so she'll think it's a gift for someone. You won't have to use it for a long time, but if you use it for a while now, it will give you GREAT benefits in the future. Many people underestimate the power of lashes and eyebrows, and what they do for your face. Your entire eye shape can look like its changed, if you have **long and thick eyelashes,** especially as a guy: it makes your **eyes** look a lot more **dominant in your face,** and gives you a more **piercing look.** And for eyebrows: **thick, full and long eyebrows can change your entire face shape** for the better**,** make you look more **mysterious and intimidating,** and defenitely **more masculine. If you are a woman, long thick eyebrows can enhance your face shape,** and **make your eyes look bigger.** Apply every evening and morning, wipe the brush twice over and a little around your eyebrows (not in the middle of them, don't risk a slight unibrow), and on your lash line (not lashes). It isn't visible in any way or something like that.\n\n\\- For skin: at night, use an **overnight anti pimple cream.** Preferably with tea tree oil. DON'T use liquid skincare, it is much more irritating for your skin in the long run, and doesn't have the extra benefits that skincare in cream forms do. During the day, moisturize and sunscreen, but I'd recommend buying a simple, **moisturizing sunscreen.** Remember, find out which things work for you and stick to them. **LESS IS MORE.** Trust me. You should only need two or three products max per night/morning routine, counting in things like lash serum, except if you have medical products you need to use.\n\n\\- **COLLAGEN POWDER.** It is SO good, doesn't have weird side effects, if you stop taking it you don't immediately see all effects dissapear, is very natural and can be taken safely even at a young age. Buy collagen powder, take it **thrice a week** (to my recommendation, but you can take more or less if you feel like it), put 1.5 spoon in a glass, pour some water in there, drink it fast before it starts sticking to the glass, and soon you'll see INSANE benefits in my experience!! First of all you'll notice change in your **skin:** it becomes **slightly tighter** around your bones, **less tired**, **reduces acne**, and **looks smoother**. It is soooo **good for your hair, lashes and eyebrows**, makes it look very healthy, and it is also a source of **proteïn** and **increases muscle mass**. Don't overuse it!! And defenitely not more than one glass a day, that is enough especially if you are under 18/20!!\n\n\\- **Facial yoga.** I know some people may think this is a myth, but I dedicated time to it, and especially around my jaw chin and cheekbones it worked wonders! People often compliment my **bone structure** and my high cheekbones now! It also just makes your **skin look better**. I'd recommend looking some easy things up, and trying to do them every night. It's also very relaxing!\n\n\\- Also, **stretch your neck and back!** Stretching your neck (carefully!!!!!!) every morning helps **reducing double chin** and gaining more **facial symmetry**, and stretching your back helps you with **posture** and in that sense also with your jaw.\n\n\\- Obviously b**rush your teeth twice a day, drink enough water, go outside (or just see the sun or light/move at least 30min) and eat 1 but preferably 2 pieces of fruit a day.** Simple things like these show after a month if you do it every day. Trust me.\n\n\\- Last one is optional, but I can tell you women LOVE it when a man **smells good**. Like it makes you ten times more attractive. The key is doing it right though: if you are sweaty and just put some deodorant or perfume on it, you don't smell good, you smell sweaty and sweet which smells even worse. Wash your armpits every morning (or preferably take a **3 min cold shower** every morning). Also, **DON'T WEAR TOO MUCH!!** you are overdoing it: does not smell good, and is noticable. I would recommend:\n\n1. **Apply deodorant under your armpits**: not axe, but doesn't have to be expensive. Just a simple, nice (I'd recommend **roller**!!) deodorant, that doesnt smell too fabricated or plastic, and apply generously.\n2. **Invest in an expensive perfume.** Not too expensive, but I'd say around the 100 dollar is worth it though. If you use it right, it will last long and the benefits will be worth it. Look up what smells women like, and what smells you like, then find a perfume that has those undertones. And here comes the important part: after you've put on deodorant, **spray ONE dash of perfume on your wrist, rub that one against your other wrist, and then rub both wrists on the skin behind your ears.** That is enough. Even though you may think you can't smell it, you can. And the fact that it's so subtle is even more attractive. Also, the wrist and then behind ears thing is because on those places the smell is better (has to do with **pheromones** and stuff) and lasts longer.\n\nAlright, this is it. I can promise you, **these things work.** I've tried (on myself and others) and have seen others try lots of things, but these work. Truly. But **they do take dedication**. Try to do them everyday. It's okay if that goes wrong at first, it's hard. But **keep trying.** Only then you'll see the true results. And I promise you with this: it completely changes you, and this comes from someone who is in a family with years of traditional beauty tricks, and who has nutritionists and skincare experts as family members.

For nighttime skincare I currently go: cleanse face/shower, moisturizer (cereve), then retinol (cereve), chapstick (bliztex) and in the winter I'll add jojoba oil because I'm prone to dryness.\n\nIn the morning I cleanse with vitamin C mineral water, then moisturizer, tinted mineral sunscreen, and chapstick.\n\nI don't really get much acne, but I'll always get little (unnoticeable to anyone else) bumps on my chin area and forehead that I'll absent mindedly touch and then make worse (such a terrible habit I want to break if you have advice for that). \n\nSo should I start using an anti acne cream or is my problem most likely more my bad habit of touching my face too often. And if you think an anti acne cream would help then which would you recommend for dry sensitive skin (if I let it get too dry or use regular sunscreen I can get eczema on my lower face). And then additionally if I start an acne cream should I then stop the nightly retinol?\n\nAdditional info: I currently wash pillowcases weekly and due to my schooling environment I wash my hands A LOT (RMT school) and shower almost every day (usually cleanse my face 2x daily tho)\n\nThankyou!!",

    "body": "i've seen a lot of posts over the last few days requesting help with choosing oils for OCM, and since the responses are a bit repetitive, i decided to try to condense all the links and info in one big post!\n\nfor starters, check out [this list of comedogenicity ratings for oils](https://www.beneficialbotanicals.com/facts-figures/comedogenic-rating.html), and also the [oils and descriptions](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/oils.html) offered on GoW. GoW also offers sampler packs for specific skincare concerns. if you don't want to order online, whole foods and other ~healthy~ food stores carry brands like weleda and auracacia.\n\nhere is a quick overview of what i think are the most common/easiest to find oils! if you want to look into more exotic things (like meadowfoam seed or brazil nut or whatever), GoW is a great source of info. \n\n**mineral oil** - prob the best overall starter oil, because it is noncomedogenic (unlikely to clog pores or cause breakouts) and inert (will not react with anything in your skin). it's also very easy to find - you can use baby oil, or if you are sensitive to fragrance you can look for wood oil (snow river wood oil is ~$5 at bed bath & beyond). i don't recommend using mineral oil sold as a laxative because those are often thickened with tocopherols in a way that irritates or clogs a lot of people's skin.\n\n**other noncomedogenic oils** - sunflower, safflower, and hemp seed. these are good for acne-prone or easily clogged skin. keep in mind that if you have any contact allergies to plants, you want to be careful with oils from those plants just in case you have a reaction to the oils as well. \n\n**lighter oils** - grape seed, olive, sesame, jojoba, and apricot kernel. these are all slightly comedogenic, so patch test carefully. most of them tend to feel more moisturizing than noncomedogenic oils, with the exception of grape seed, which is somewhat astringent and can be a little drying.\n\n**richer oils** - almond and avocado. both of these have a slightly thicker/richer feel and tend to be very nourishing/moisturizing. again, these are slightly comedogenic, so patch test carefully. but these can be great for dry or dehydrated skin. unfortunately, due to their thicker texture, these oils are not as good at breaking up and quickly removing waterproof makeup as lighter oils.\n\n**highly comedogenic oils** - coconut oil, coconut butter, cocoa butter, mink oil, and soybean oil. these are not, like, guaranteed to break you out, but you need to be cautious if you have very acne-prone skin. \n\n\nthe following oils are used for specific skincare concerns:\n\n**castor oil** - has antibacterial properties, so it can help with acne. castor oil can be very drying, so you should dilute it to about 1-2 tbsp castor oil in 1 cup carrier oil. you can use that mixture either for ocm or to spot treat. do not use it undiluted to spot treat. i do not recommend using castor oil sold as a laxative for skincare purposes, for the same reasons mentioned in reference to mineral oil.\n\n**tea tree oil** - very good antibacterial, and can be super good for acne. tea tree oil is extremely drying/irritating, and you **should not ever use it undiluted!** undiluted tea tree oil can be extremely irritating, and even lead to chemical burns! you should dilute 1/4 tsp of tto in 1 cup of carrier oil, and you can use that mixture either for ocm or for a spot treatment. note that tea tree oil is usually sold as an essential oil, so it will usually be in a tiny bottle.\n\n**neem oil** - great for acne, and it is not drying, so you can use it undiluted as a spot treatment, or for ocm either alone or mixed with other carrier oils. word of caution - it smells super weird!\n\n**evening primrose oil** - this is supposedly really good for hormonal acne, but i have never personally tried it, and i can't find many sources to support this. however, there are [many,](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2133.1987.tb04085.x/abstract) [many](http://adc.bmj.com/content/75/6/494.abstract) sources supporting evening primrose oil as a very effective treatment for atopic dermatitis and eczema (although if you have either of those conditions, it would be best for you to be under the supervision of a derm or another medical professional, so talk to them before you start using anything new). as far as i know, it is fine to use this undiluted. \n\ngeneral notes on choosing oils:\n\n- be sure whatever you buy is 100% whatever oil and probably at least food grade. buzzwords like \"cold pressed,\" \"unrefined,\" etc, are *usually* good. for botanical oils, a lot of people think you should look for minimally processed or unrefined oils to ensure you get all the benefits from the oil. \n\n- when buying cooking oils (esp. relevant for olive, sunflower, and sesame oil), be very careful about what you buy and always patch test. there has been a lot of controversy lately about cooking oils being impure or diluted with other oils besides the one listed on the label, so be careful. [here](http://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/news-events/news/files/olive%20oil%20final%20071410%20.pdf) is the 2010 report about olive oil that has people in a fuss about this.\n\n- your safest option, although it may not be the cheapest or the most convenient, is to buy oils that are sold specifically for skincare or cosmetic use.\n\ni hope this was somewhat helpful!! remember that no one can tell you for sure whether or not something will work for you or cause a negative reaction, so it's ultimately up to you to do some research and choose what to put on your face. and always patch test all the oils you want to use individually before mixing or putting anything all over your face!! :)",

Jojoba Oil in particularly seemed problematic for my forehead.\n\nI've been using Mineral Oil OCM with good results so far, but it's still hard to determine if it's been breaking me out (most likely suspect is CeraVe in the Tub, which I started using as a moisturizer around the same time).\n\nI was using undiluted TTO applied directly to my entire face (NOT spot-treating), and that did cause a chemical burn. Oops. Now I use undiluted Tea Tree Oil to spot-treat (which you said never to do!) and it's worked well so far, since I'm not applying it for prolonged periods of time to any region (hence, spot-treating).\n\nI was thinking making the switch to Neem Oil from TTO as a spot-treatment. Does it really stink that bad? Is it as effective as TTO, or does that depend?\n\nAlso, what washcloth do you recommend in general? I have a microfiber towel that I use, but I feel as though it may be slightly too rough.\n\nAlso thinking about adding just a few drops of TTO to the Mineral Oil per your suggestion because... well, why not?

I just had mine done early this month. I personally found it really difficult to figure out what to apply on my lips that also respected the dos and don'ts...and honestly I just kept using my Dr. Jart Ceramidin lip balm because it wouldn't drag against my skin, didn't need a finger to apply, and I could dab around my piercing and not by or on it. This and drinking a lot of cool water through a straw.   \n\n\nI used chopsticks to eat also. I love using them, but also it made it much easier to navigate around my piercing than with a spoon or fork.  \n\n\nIt looks alright, just make sure it doesn't feel like it's pulling at all at the bottom and it'll be smooth sailing soon. Careful with the jewelry rotating around when the swelling goes down a bit- if it moves too much you can go in to downsize the barbell a touch.

    "body": "Just wanted to rave about this. I'd just bought chamomile tea to deal with some hypertrophic scarring on my cartilage piercing (it's a common DIY treatment), when I noticed FOUR (4!!!) cystic bumps brewing on my chin. They were at that stage when they were barely visible now, but you know they're going to get angrier and redder very soon. The same thing happened at the same time last month, so I'm pretty sure this acne is hormonal. And I know for a fact that my usual go-to, tea tree oil, doesn't work on these cystic suckers.\n\nI decided to try out the chamomile tea compress on my chin as well my ear. It's been three days and I'm thrilled with the results. Three of the bumps are magically gone and the last one (the biggest one) has dramatically reduced in size/redness and is no longer sore. Some quick research shows that chamomile is powerfully anti-inflammatory and also has antioxidant and antibacterial properties.\n\nHere’s what I did:\n\n* Brew some chamomile tea. I’m using Twinings Pure Chamomile.\n\n* After 4 mins, pour some of the tea out into a shot glass.\n\n* Dip one side of a cotton pad into the shot glass and hold it against chin until it gets cold (2-3 mins).\n\n* Repeat last step once or twice more.\n\nI also drank the rest of the tea, for what it’s worth. If anyone else is dealing with cystic acne, this is worth trying out IMO. The reduction in inflammation is apparent after just a few hours. (Although apparently some people are allergic to chamomile, so be sure patch test on your elbow first!)",

    "body": "so i've seen a few people mention using honey on their face as a cleanser or a mask (i've used it myself too!) and it seems to be something that could be really helpful for people who have drier, acne-prone skin. i started to look up one thing in response to a question in another thread, found a bunch of stuff, and decided to throw it all into one new post.\n\n**what is honey?**\n\nhoney is a food made by bees from the nectar of flowers. it is mostly sugar (fructose, glucose, matose, and sucrose).\n\nwhen you buy honey at the store, you usually have a number of different options. pasteurized honey (the cheaper syrupy kind in a bear-shaped bottle) and raw honey (a gritty, crystal-y product usually sold in a jar) are the two types i think are most common.\n\nthe average pH of honey is about 3.9, which a typical range of 3.4 to 6.1. \n\n**why would you put honey on your face?**\n\nhoney offers a number of benefits for the skin!\n\n* it is a humectant. this is probably due to certain components in the honey, such as sugars, amino acids, and lactic acid. this means that honey will attract moisture and trap it on your skin. honey is also occlusive, meaning that it essentially forms a protective film and it is extra good at trapping moisture in your skin!\n* its antimicrobial (both antibacterial and antifungal) effects are super well attested, meaning it should be helpful in treating acne and other skin conditions. the antimicrobial properties of honey are due to a number of factors, including its sugar content (and the osmotic effect of sugar), its hydrogen peroxide content (which is produced because of enzyme activity in the honey), its acidity, and potentially some plant-derived substances.\n* it contains a number of naturally occurring acids, including acetic, butyric, citric, \nformic, gluconic, lactic, malic, pyroglutamic, and succinic. this might mean that honey could offer some mild exfoliation benefits, particularly because of the lactic acid.\n* it has anti-inflammatory effects.\n* some recent studies have shown that honey may offer antioxidant benefits.\n\n**does it matter what kind of honey you put on your face?**\n\nshort answer: no.\n\nlong answer:  \nmany people have suggested that raw honey is a better choice than pasteurized honey. however, it's been proven both raw and pasteurized honey show the same level of antimicrobial activity. and because the other benefits of honey (the humectant/occlusive properties, etc) are attributed to components of honey that aren't removed during pasteurization (sugars), i think we can safely assume that those benefits are also exactly the same in both raw and pasteurized honey.\n\nanother type of honey that people sometimes praise as being better than other honey is manuka honey. manuka honey is produced specifically from the nectar of the manuka tree (aka the \"tea tree\"). it's possible that this is because people assume that since tea tree oil is great for treating acne, and honey is great for treating acne, honey from the tea tree must be extra great at treating acne. however, it does not appear that this is true. manuka honey is somewhat special because it appears that its antimicrobial properties have nothing to do with its content of hydrogen peroxide (unlike other honeys), but it has not been shown to be a more effective product than other honeys. in fact, for certain fungal infections, a much higher concentration of manuka honey than regular honey was required to inhibit fungal growth.\n\n**how should you put honey on your face?**\n\nwhen used as a dressing for wounds, it appears that soaking a dressing with honey, applying that dressing to the wound, and then covering the area with another dressing is the most convenient and effective method. to use honey as an overnight spot treatment, you could replicate this by placing a dab of honey on the affected area and covering it with a small bandage that has a gauze pad in it. you could also try soaking a small piece of a gauze pad in honey, applying that to the affected area, and then covering the area with something else. results observed when using honey as a wound dressing in clinical practice suggest that if you can keep the honey dressing on the wound for 24 hours, you should begin to see improvement by that point. if you are only using honey as an overnight spot treatment, it may take longer to see effects.\n\nnote: the pH of honey is slightly more acidic than what you really want to put on your face, so it may be best to dilute the honey with water or oil if you can before using it as a spot treatment. studies on honey's antibacterial activity show that it can be diluted down to about 45% v/v for manuka honey and 20% v/v for other honey and still be effective against fungal infections. against bacterial infections, all types of honey are effective down to about a 10% v/v solution. \n\nif you are not into DIY-ing honey-soaked wound dressings for your face, using honey as a mask will probably offer a lot of the same benefits. apply the honey to your clean face, let it sit for however long you want (at least a couple of minutes), and then remove gently with a warm damp washcloth and go about the rest of your routine as usual. ideally you wouldn't want to cleanse again after the mask because that might counteract a lot of the moisturizing benefits, and any residue from the honey might still offer antibacterial benefits, but if you feel like the mask leaves sticky residue that bothers you, then go ahead and cleanse.\n\ni didn't find anything to suggest that honey would make a good cleanser - the benefits of that would come from just having it on your face, not rubbing it around with water or anything, so you might as well just do a mask.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nbecause it is both moisturizing and antibacterial, honey could potentially be great for people who have drier or dehydrated acne-prone skin as an alternative to other antimicrobial treatments (which are typically drying or irritating). but as always, patch test on unbroken skin first!! and if you have any allergy, especially a contact allergy, to any flowering plants, you should probably avoid honey from those plants. \n\n\n____________\n\nsources: most of these are available as free full-text articles. if the link doesn't take you

Anyway, my FDHs family is well aware of mine and my son's situation with bug sprays and my issue with tea tree.\nAll weekend they kept trying to hound me to put bug spray on my son. Just as I thought they had given up on asking something so stupid they went and brought an all-natural bug spray they wouldn’t let me read the can at all. It turns out this bug spray is nearly pure tea tree oil and the partner's sister thought it would be a grand idea to spray my son with it right next to me (she didn't even ask if it was okay to spray my son with the spray she just took it upon herself to just do it). Well, the spray that she was spraying caused my airways to start to close up and it caused me to break out in hives. \nThey're well known for pulling this type of shit with me and my son and FDH won't say shit to them when they mess with my sons and my allergies. To him, it’s my job to correct his lot when they pull this shit (I’ve tried but they won’t listen to me at all they just roll their eyes at me like little kids). I’ve told him either he starts to pull up his family on their bullshit and start standing up for my son and myself when his family start fucking with our allergies or both my son and I are gone permanently as I'm not going to allow them to jeopardise my sons' health and well-being \n\nOh and the FDH sister still can't understand why I refuse to allow her or anyone else in her family to babysit my son",

I had bad hormonal acne that popped up in my late 20s, and I finally have it under control in my mid-30s (I also had acne in my teens and early 20s though). Here are the three things that I think helped the most:\n\n1- DIM supplement. I used the Smokey Mountain Naturals brand. The first few days of taking it you might get a headache. It really really helped clear up the big cystic acne all over my jawline. After 7-8 years of taking it, I've found I don't need it every day - I typically take it every other day or so. I think it also helped my mood.\n\n2- Tretinoin. This has helped a lot and keeps the smaller pimples away and helps clear up any rogue cystic ones faster. It took me a lot of trial and error to figure out a routine that worked for my super sensitive skin. I use .025% cream 4-5 times per week (the gel version wrecked my skin barrier). I use almost no other actives.\n\n3- Pimple patches. I like the Hero brand or the CosRX ones. Not only do these help it heal better, but it prevented me from picking at my skin. So simple, but made such a difference. I wish I had these as a teen. \n\nBest of luck, and I hope you find something that works for you!\n\n(Edit: formatting)",

For me, that happened when I went into overdrive in trying to resolve my acne that doing so worsened my acne; let time do its thing. Second, your skin is dehydrated. A broken moisture barrier, especially during the winter isn't great. For your acne that is past its peak, treat them like you would scab/scar and use aquaphor or vaseline after moisturizing it so that it doesn't scab enough for your to pick at. For actives that hurt and throb, give it time. If you can't, use a pimple patch (I like mighty patch) to keep you from touching it. \n\nIt sucks to have the kind of break outs that we do/did.

If so, you should definitely see your GP and get an open one swabbed for MRSA.\n\nFor picking, there is evidence to support the use of NAC supplement (oral). I started it a while back and maybe it’s placebo but… it’s helped tremendously. I no longer pick absentmindedly (sometimes I stare too long in the mirror and do it… but that’s conscious). Also simply reading a comment about how when you pick at deep cystic acne you potentially open it up under the skin and the bacteria then spreads (causing more), helped me stop myself too. \n\nFor hormones, as others have said something like the mirena IUD often works even if women who find other hormonal birth control problematic, as it isn’t systemic like a pill and it’s very low dose. Ovasitol is a supplement that is also beneficial. Spearmint tea twice a day also has evidence to support its use (and obviously won’t hurt). \n\nI use a q tip to apply Paula’s Choice 2% Salicylic acid to my cystic/nodular acne. It’s too harsh for my whole face but I do find it progresses them quicker. I’ll also use anti redness eye drops (specifically Lumify) directly onto the irritated cystic acne and that helps clear up a lot of the redness, which makes no difference to healing but makes me less insecure and less likely to pick.",

    "body": "**\"The deodorant industry *hates* her!\"**\n\n\nWith a quick Google search, you can find a myriad of recipes and videos on how to make your own. I came across [this one](http://wellnessmama.com/1523/how-to-make-natural-deodorant-beating-the-b-o-with-natural-deo/) a few months back, and since then, haven't looked back.\n\nI've always had problems with sweat and odor, and went so far as to get prescription strength stuff like [HyperCare](http://www.drugs.com/comments/aluminum-chloride-hexahydrate-topical/hypercare.html) and considered (but didn't get) botox injections a few years back. Although HyperCare does work, it left my skin dry, flaky, and burning at times.\n\n>Be sure to follow the directions about mixing the dry stuff together, separate from the wet stuff, prior to combining all ingredients. The process for warming the coconut oil and shea butter is outlined on [the site above](http://wellnessmama.com/1523/how-to-make-natural-deodorant-beating-the-b-o-with-natural-deo/). Instead of a double boiler, I used a microwave to heat them for about 20 seconds.\n\n>My mixture consists of:\n* 3 Tbsp coconut oil\n* 1 Tbsp baking soda\n* 1 Tbsp cornstarch\n\n>... and the optional additions:\n* 1/8 tsp Vitamin E oil\n* 1/8 tsp Shea Butter\n* 8-10 drops Tea Tree oil\n\n\n>I put the finished product in a small glass jar that used to hold pimentos, flipped it upside down, and popped it in the fridge. When I need it after a shower, I just open it and apply because the mixture sits just above the lip of the jar. Note that you don't have to keep it in the fridge, but just know that it will liquefy in temperatures over 75 deg F (25 deg C).  You can add whatever oils suit your taste, but I love tea tree for its aroma, and anti-viral/anti-fungal properties.\n\nI was skeptical at first when I made it because we hadn't hit hundred-degree temperatures yet here in Texas, so I wasn't sure it would stand the test. I was also pretty worried it would stain my clothes. However, I'm happy to report that I've had complete success with this recipe, no stains on clothing, and I've even made it for 5 people, which in turn, have made it for others. \n\nOf course, I still sweat and stink a little when I'm outside doing stuff in midday heat, but it's definitely not as bad as it was when I was using HyperCare and clinical strength deodorant. Also, just like the website I linked first, I have also begun to sweat less, and I still can't believe it. I can actually skip a day and not put any deodorant on, and I don't sweat or have odor even half as much as I did when I was constantly re-applying with the store bought stuff. \n\nSeriously, do yourself a favor, ~~and stop putting aluminum compounds on your skin that can make you ill.~~\n\nIt works!\n\nEdit: Reporting in after running errands in 113 degree F heat. It's still working!\nEdit 2: Forgot to mention how amazingly soft my skin is now. It used to be dry, flaky, and irritated. Added bonus!\n\n*Edit 3: Alright guys, I get it. I said something that wasn't fact-checked, and that was an assumption. It's eliminated. The point I was trying to get across was that if you've never thought of making your own deodorant, and you have issues with products that you've tried that have failed in some way, then I suggest you try this method. What will it hurt? For years I tried different things, and this works well FOR ME. It's obviously not for everyone. Unless you have an allergy to any of the ingredients mentioned, then you're set. See if this will work for you as amazingly as it has for myself and my friends. That's it.*",

With that being said, I have had the botox treatments about four times now and they have been a lifesaver. Here is my story.\n\nAs a teenage girl with hyperhidrosis, high school was an absolute nightmare for me. People thought I smelled because they could see sweat on me (which I didn't) or would say that I don't shower and I was dirty because I sweat so much. It was extremely hurtful as I am a very cleanly person and I have a medical condition that I had no control over but was getting teased as if it was my choice. \n\nThe botox is painful. I am not going to lie. You aren't allowed to shave your underarms for two weeks before the procedure and then you have to lay hands behind your head on a doctor's table under a very hot light so they can see where you are sweating. It is very uncomfortable to have people staring at your unshaved armpits (something in my normal life would be traumatizing).\n\nThey stick about 50 tiny needles into each armpit and it hurts/stings pretty bad. Within the few days after the procedure, your underarms are very tender and develop bruises, BAD ONES. A few weeks later they are gone and I have about 1 to 2 years of no sweat dripping down my entire shirt. It was a miracle to find this procedure for me, I feel like a human being again and people treat me like one. \n\nEdit again, sorry. I used all the super aluminum deoderants-clinical strengths etc. And they always burned my armpits and irritated then tremendously. Botox has been the only solution for me.",

    "body": "I've struggled with acne since I was 10. During my developing years, it was just regular run-of-the-mill acne. (Papules, whiteheads, etc.) I thought my skin was bad then (it was as clear as a bell in hindsight 😒), but boy howdy! Did my skin show me once I hit 23!\n\nSince then I have been battling with the absolute worst type of acne you can get: PUSTULES. Plus, my skin started scarring SO BADLY along with it. I've tried it all: salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, tea tree oil, tretinoin, clindamycin, witchazel, DIM, Differin, Aczone, Spironolactone, blue light treatments, spearmint tea, turmeric/honey/lemon masks, countless dermatologist visits, you name it! Nothing worked!!\n\nI got psyched out last year as my skin seemed to FINALLY be giving me my reprieve. So I got a chemical peel and a microneedling treatment for my scars (1st 3 pics are right after those procedures.) But then this year arrives (recent, last 4 pics) and the cystic acne comes back with a vengeance! My face hurts constantly and I seriously want to walk into the ocean at this point. 😫 What. Does. My. Facial skin. Want from me!?? Send help plz!",

        "body": "Have you had your hormones tested? Asking because of the pattern of acne and seeing that one facial hair (I know we all get hairs here and there, but the combo of the two symptoms) makes me wonder about PCOS. Are you on birth control? Some birth control pills worsen acne because theyre androgenic. Also last resort is Accutane and I see you havent tried that. Given your pattern of acne it's odd that spiro didnt work. Maybe you didnt go on a high enough dose or did you get side effects? A topical + spiro and sometimes also a low androgenic birth control like Yaz or Yasmin (esp if spiro is giving you irregular periods) can help and like I said, Accutane as a last resort, but if your acne is hormonal it can come back even after a round of Accutane.",

The association between depression and Accutane could just as easily be individuals feeling higher levels of depression when they have a greater amount of acne. This could have initially led researchers to deduce Accutane was causing the depression, instead of the acne itself. \n\nI’ve been on Accutane for a couple of months now and it’s changed my life. I can finally wash my face without it hurting, and I feel so much more comfortable in my own skin. I would really consider it if you’ve tried everything else! I was in the exact same boat.",

It’s a serious commitment for about 6 months to a year of your life but I know someone who did it and it helped her tremendously. You should do some research on it and ask your doctor/derm for advice on whether it’s right for you.\n\nSecondly, my personal opinion is that most things that show up on our bodies physically are a result of what’s going on inside. I’ve learned that any type of physical reaction I’ve ever had was because I was lacking in something diet or nutritional wise. My advice to you would be to look at everything that you’re eating, not eating, supplements etc and either do some research on your own or see a naturopathic doctor. \n\nAlso don’t let people diagnose you on here.",

When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best.\n\n* The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.\n\n**Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!**\n\n*If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.

    "body": "**Long Story** **Rocky Middle** **Happy Ending**\n\nI work for Poison Control and I have had so many essential oils cases, but I have a couple that were made **extra** difficult due to MLM huns and their high quality extra special essential oils!\n\nThe Case: 1 year old boy had accidentally ingested a good amount of an essential oil. This happens all the time - kids get into and ingest everything! We never shame or scold the parents or caregivers. We just need the specifics about the ingestion to make the best clinical decisions for the child. \n\n*And seriously, after so many cases and realizing how excellent kids are at getting into everything - I genuinely do not judge. My absolute favorite thing is telling parents that this happens all the time and then hearing them take a big sigh of relief that they’re not the only one and they’re not a bad parent and we’re going to do everything we can to help their child.*\n\n*Side note in case you’re worried: if it is a legitimate serious concern for child welfare - like when a baby girl ate meth - it does get properly handled. But honestly even that mom did not give me as much push back as the MLM mom in this case.*\n\nAnyway, mom isn’t directly giving me the specific information I need to make an assessment. I need to know **what kind of essential oil.** Some essential oils are irritating to the oral mucosa. Some are innately toxic. Some cause respiratory depression. Some can kill a child. I need to know what kind and the only actual detail I keep getting is that it’s a Young Living oil.\n\n>Young Living is all they use in their house and it should be fine, right?\n\nOkay, but let’s figure that out for sure, shall we?\nFinally I get more information...\n\n> It’s Owie. It’s for kids. It’s the Young Living kids line and it has all kid safe oils in it.\n\nFrom what I can tell this literally only meant that it was slightly diluted? But she also said it was 100% pure essential oils? And from what she’s telling me it’s for cuts and scrapes I guess? And maybe kids aromatherapy?\n\nIt literally does not matter - I need to know WHAT IS IN IT. How big is the bottle. How much is left. I’m getting pretty much none of the answers I actually need. It’s not that she’s trying to pitch me on Young Living, it’s just that she’s assuming everyone knows and uses this oil and she shouldn’t have to explain anything about it - have I not heard of it? For the safety of your child and for the love of god can you just answer my questions? No? Okay.\n\nBut now that I have enough info and context clues to just google it myself...\n\nTurns out it’s a blend of mostly Tea Tree Oil, Balsam Oil, and Clove Oil, along with some other essential oils. It comes in a standard 5 mL bottle. From context clues at this point I’m assuming the whole bottle is gone. There’s no flow limiting dropper, but she doesn’t say if there ever was one. Did she remove it? Did he swallow it? I guess we’ll never know? It’s not spilled anywhere. His breath smells like it.\n\nOkay so he ingested what I have to assume is potentially up to 5 mL. It’s a blend, which means he didn’t get 5 mL of any one oil so that’s better! **However, Clove Oil is not safe in any amount more than a taste in such a small child. Plus add to that an unknown amount of Tea Tree Oil which is also toxic when ingested. He needs medical attention.** After telling her that she just argues with me...\n\n> It’s an oil for kids and it’s all safe all their oils are safe actually and also it’s better quality because it’s Young Living and it’s pure and it’s not synthetic and it’s actually very good for you and it should be fine. It’s not like it can really do anything harmful. \n\nThis was hard because I don’t really have a palatable argument for straight up nonsense. She’s wasting time arguing so I have to clearly state the hard truth of what the clinical consequences could be if she refuses treatment for her child.\n\n**Clinical Side Note**\n\n*Clove Oil (Eugenol) can cause serious toxicity including respiratory depression, sedation, seizures, coma, and liver toxicity in children who ingest relatively small amounts, even as little as 2 mL.*\n\n*Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca) can cause serious toxicity including aspiration pneumonitis, respiratory depression, CNS depression, and ataxia in as little as 5 mL.*\n\nWell as you can probably guess, mom is absolutely astounded! She’s still sure these oils are safe. They’re for children. They’re high quality. Blah blah. And I’m just wishing I could tell her how little all of that matters. It was exhausting. Her trust in Young Living oils delayed medical treatment for her baby.\n\nLuckily in the end she did the right thing. He ended up being admitted with sedation and respiratory depression. I don’t know his discharge disposition, but thankfully he got medical treatment and was generally okay in the end.\n\n**tl;dr Young Living Mom’s trust in the safety of her oils delayed medical treatment for her baby.**",

The other parents she talks to will feel a false sense of security and may not seek medical help quickly if their own child ingests oil.

    "body": "Original beginner routine thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19oiyy/the_starter_skincare_regimen_a_basic_routine_for/). The comment section here can be really helpful, but it was getting quite long, so we thought it would be good to start a new Beginner thread.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMany people come to look to revamp their current routines or create a new routine. While not all of the products mentioned here will work for 100% of people, this is a good place to start regardless of skin type/concern. \n\nThe products mentioned are those commonly recommended on the sub and by no means is it comprehensive. In addition, the products mentioned here tend to be affordable/widely available/effective for most people.\n\n**But PLEASE keep in mind that skincare is not an exact science and no one can guarantee success for an individual.**\nRecommendations on here have been the most well tolerated that we've encountered and users report a high degree of success with them. However, sensitivities are possible with any product and no product can guarantee 100% efficacy and tolerance in an entire population.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFirst,  **stop** using St. Ives Apricot Scrub!!! The particles are large, non-uniform, sharp, and too abrasive to be suitable for facial use. Also, ditch any citrus fruits on the face and baking soda scrubs. More info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/195lue/psa_please_do_not_use_baking_soda_on_your_skin_it/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/13wz1y/psa_lemons_and_limes_great_for_food_not_for_skin/). \n\nNext, **don't buy everything at once: include only 1 new product at a time**. Don't buy a new full blown routine if you don't need it!   Be patient, take your time, and **[Test patch](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/14sd25/i_just_learned_how_to_do_a_test_patch_properly/).**  .\n\nIf you can't seem to find a particular product in your country, a few online stores/companies can be helpful and ship internationally. These include [sasa](http://web1.sasa.com/SasaWeb/splash.jsp), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/), [iherb](http://www.iherb.com/), and [mmmule](http://mmmule.com/). \n\nNow, onto recommendations!!\n\n\n- **Cleanser** \n\n  We frequently tell folks it's not necessary to cleanse 2x a day, particularly for those suffering with oily/dehydrated/dry skin types. Exceptions include things like post-workouts or if you've been sweating through the night.\n\n  If your skin is feeling tight/dry/squeaky after cleansing, you should look for a new cleanser.\n\n  *Cleanser Recs*\n  \n  ~ Cerave Foaming (US/Canada): Suitable for acne prone\n\n  ~ Cerave Hydrating (US/Canada): Better for non-acne prone/dry\n\n  ~ Spectro Jel (Canada): Suitable for acne-prones\n\n  ~ Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash (UK/US/Canada/other?): Potentially suitable for all skin types\n\n  ~ Eucerin DermatoClean, \"gentle\" (Worldwide): Suitable for sensitive/acne prone\n\n  ~ [Oil Cleansing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/): Suitable for almost all skin types, but the oil/oils you use depends on your skin type. Those with SD should tread lightly with this method, as some oils can exacerbate the issue.\n\n  \n- **Exfoliation**\n\n  Chemical exfoliation is the preferred method on /r/skincareaddiction, it tends to be more gentle than physical exfoliation *and* you can do it daily. You can learn more about the different types of chemical exfoliators in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1hj8yo/whats_the_difference_ahas_vs_bhas/) sidebar post.  \n\n  Lactic acid is the most gentle, so if you suffer with eczema/rosacea prone sensitive skin, start with lactic.  If you're acne prone/have lots of clogs and/or oily, start with a BHA (salicylic acid). If you are combo, and want the humectant benefits of an AHA, try Mandelic---partly oil soluble AHA. \n\n  Physical exfoliation (yes this includes a washcloth and the Clarisonic!) should not be used more than 1-2x a week, and not if you have active acne, sensitive, flaking, or irritated skin.\n\n  Exfoliation will be beneficial if you have any of the following concerns (not comprehensive): zits, uneven texture, congestion, blackheads, whiteheads, dull skin, dry skin, [sebaceous filaments (SFs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/), etc.\n\n  Since AHAs/BHAs work at a lower pH to exfoliate, it's helpful to wait a few minutes before applying your next product (ie-moisturizer). If you don't have time to wait that length of time, at least wait until the AHA/BHA is dry.\n\n   Aim to use the AHAs in the PM--these cause photosensitivity. BHAs are more flexible, but when you can, do your exfoliation in the PM.\n\n  *BHA exfoliator recs (alcohol free)*\n\n  ~ Stridex Maximum Strength Pads aka Stridex in the red box (US/available on iherb or Vitacost): 2% salicylic. If known serious sensitivity to light fragrance/menthol proceed with caution. These tend to work fine for the majority of people\n\n  ~ Paula's Choice BHAs (Worldwide): Fragrance-free options, but pricier than stridex\n\n  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Various BHA products\n  \n  ~ Neutrogena 3 in 1 Oil Free Acne Stress Control Hydrating Acne Treatment (Various locations): 2% SA, light fragrance, contains 'cones.\n\n  *AHA exfoliator recs*\n\n  ~ St Ives Scrub Free Exfoliating Pads (US): 4-5% lactic acid. If very sensitive to fragrance or known fruit allergies, proceed with caution.\n\n  ~ Silk Naturals AHA Toner (US based but will ship to some international locations): 8% Lactic acid. Contains aloe. Fragrance-free.\n\n  ~ Paula's Choice AHAs (Worldwide): Varying concentrations of glycolic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir (Worldwide): 8-10% glycolic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Varying Glycolic/lactic/ AHA+BHA combos\n\n  ~ Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (US/International through iHerb): 10% glycolic acid, fragrance free\n\n  ~ Alpha Hydrox Swipes or Intensive Serum ( US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 14% glycolic acid, fragrance free\n\n  ~ MUAC Mandelic Serum (US/ ships internationally): 10% mandelic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ Avene Cleanance K (US/Canada/Europe/Aussie/possibly other locations): AHA/BHA product.  2% Lactic, 6% Glycolic, and 1% Salicylic. Slightly more expensive than the other recommendations. Fragrance-free.\n\n- **Moisturize**\n\n  Everyone needs a moisturizer, even those with oily skin!  A lot of the time at least part of the oil production is commonly due to dehydration (aka lack of moisture). \n\n  *Moisturizer Recs*\n\n  ~ Cerave Cream aka Cerave in the tub (US/Canada): Suitable for any skin type. Also works for the body. Fast absorbing, lots of humectants/ceramides. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/) thread has info on getting a pump lid for the jar.\n  \n  ~ Oilatum Natural Repair (UK): Suitable for any skin type. Similar to Cerave in the tub, though a tad more greasy. \n\n  ~ Cetaphil Lotion/Cream (Many locations worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Slightly greasier formula to Cerave in the tub. \n\n  ~ Vaseline  (Worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Good to add on top of moisturizer, or use alone to prevent water loss.\n\n  ~ EltaMD Intense Moisturizer (US): Vaseline alternative, non-sticky/day friendly option.\n\n\n- **Sunscreen**\n\n  This is your choice, just be sure to wear it everyday and it's at least SPF30 with high UVA protection. It's even more crucial  if you're using AHAs, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or you're on particular oral medications.\n\n  Proper amount for application is 2mg/cm^2. This is about 1/4 teaspoon (~1.2 mL) for the face alone. Reapplication should be every 1.5-2 hours (maybe even more depending on how nasty the UV index will be that day), and after every time you take a dunk in water. \n\n  Recommendations highly vary depending on location and type of finish you prefer. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15tuqd/for_those_interested_in_trying_out_new_susncreens/) sidebar link on sunscreens gives you all you need to know.  Also, try a board search and look on the first few pages of the sub.\n\n  Generally, if you are very sensitive or acne prone, you'll want to look for an all physical sunscreen or at least a physical/chemical combo.  All chemical sunscreens tend to cause stinging/breakouts/irritation for many people.\n\n- **Spot Treatments/Masks**\n\n  This will vary based on your skin type, personal preference as well. An effective spot treatment generally has antimicrobial/anti inflammatory properties. \n\n  *Spot Treatments to Consider*\n\n  ~ Benzoyl Peroxide cream/wash:  If in a wash, leave on skin for a few minutes before cleansing off to allow the BP to take effect. Side effects can be dryness/redness sensitivity. [2.5%](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1j4l9o/just_want_to_share_what_my_doctor_told_me_today/cbb2fen) is also A-OK to use, and can be just as effective as the higher concentrations with just less irritation.\n\n  ~ Sulfur ointment/cream: Tends to be less irritating than BP\n\n  ~ Tea Tree Oil: Should be diluted with a carrier oil to avoid a chemical burn. Avoid if prone to allergic contact dermatitis. Potent fragrance.\n\n  ~ Neem Oil: Very potent fragrance \n\n  ~ Clay masks: These will help clear pores and help bring some acne to a head.    Bentonite is the strongest, not great for dry/very sensitive skin, and should be mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV).   Kaolin/Rhassoul/French green are less drying and do not need to be mixed with ACV.\n__________________________________________________________\n\n**Order of Products**\n\nAs far as the order of your new and snazzy routine goes, it really depends, which is partly why we didn't include anything specific on here. \n\nThere's also a lot of flexibility in how/when you can use things (more pertaining to hydroxy acids).  Some people use multiple hydroxy acids (some in the form of a liquid) and/or have RX products that they need to use, so depending on the situation, the order and how often to apply things will differ. \n\nAn *example* routine with all of the things listed could go:\n\n**AM**\n\n-  Splash with water (unless feeling really grimy, use your cleanser)\n- Moisturizer\n- Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n- (If applicable) Remove makeup, preferably with an oil\n- Cleanser\n- Exfoliator\n- Wait a few minutes, at least til it dries\n- Moisturizer\n- Spot treatment (also can come before moisturizer, *do whatever works for you*)\n\nAgain, this is JUST an example, and not etched in stone. It all depends what other things you're using and whether or not you need to tweak order of things, or increase or decrease usage of products.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions or leave some more product recs!",

I cleanse with an oil and CeraVe hydrating to get some moisture, but then rarely use an actual moisturizer and, if I do, only where I need it. So, there are different philosophies on this.",

I picked up the Cerave cream, and applied it 'liberally' like it says on the package the first time. Turned me into a greasy sweaty mess. The next day I applied it much thinner, just a pea-sized amount or so, and it was still a little greasy. This morning I applied about half that amount and it finally felt good, but I'm wondering if that's enough to even be effective.\n\n2. Should I apply the Cerave everywhere? My nose is the only part of my face that really gets oily - does it still need to be moisturized? What about under my eyes? I've seen mentions here and there that you don't actually need a specialized undereye cream, but I'm kind of paranoid from years of hearing that regular moisturizer will destroy my eye region and make me look like a crone within weeks.\n\n3. Sunscreen - does it go under or over the moisturizer? Either way, how long should I wait between products?\n\nThank you so much for this beginner guide!",

        "body": "Pretty late on this but I'll give it a shot. And sorry if you already answered this question, there's a lot of comments so I may have missed something:\n\nEverything I've read says to apply treatment products before moisturizer, allowing it to dry in between. My problem is that I have really dry skin, and I find that my moisturizer is more effective if I apply it when my skin is still slightly damp. My current night routine is to pre-cleanse with jojoba to dissolve makeup, wash with cetaphil gentle cleanser, moisturize, allow that to dry and THEN apply neutrogena hydrating acne treatment gel (2% SA).\nThis routine has been great as far as keeping my skin moisturized and flake free, but I'm worried the BHA isn't working as effectively as it could to keep my pores unclogged. Since SA is oil soluble my theory is that it can still penetrate through the moisturizer but maybe I'm totally wrong about this.\n\nso my question is, is it worth it to moisturize while my skin is still damp or does moisturizing first reduce the effectiveness of the BHA too much?\n\n*edit for clarity",

I'd appreciate any feedback!  :)\n\nOk, so from what I've gathered, my skin type is sensitive, acne prone combo (it's oily in the T-Zone and dry everywhere else) and I have adult onset hormonal acne.  It means that the worst of my acne actually doesn't pop up in the oily areas, but instead along my jaw/cheeks/behind my ears.  I'm proscribed Spironolactone, which has cleared up the major papules, but I do still have quite a number of whiteheads. \n\nI've tested the Cerave Foaming cleanser and the Cerave in the tub for over a month at this point.  I really liked the way that my skin felt with them, but my skin gets tight after cleansing.  It does feel fine after I moisturize though.  So, does this mean it's too harsh?  I'm still a bit confused as to whether the tightness is expected before moisturizing?  \n\nNow that I've had a month of testing the products and know that they don't cause problems, I want to start introducing a chemical exfoliant as well.  I'm hoping this will help with the whiteheads I have.\n\nFrom my understanding, BHAs like Stridex are great for acne prone skin, but I'm also worried about the effects they have on sensitive skin.  Additionally - since my acne is hormonal will these even really affect it, other than to potentially damage healthy skin and re-aggrivate it?  Or am I not understanding hormonal acne?  Would I be better to start with lactic acid because of that gentleness?\n\nThanks in advance for any responses and opinions!  I'll for sure patch test whatever I decide on, but it's good to talk it out before I make the purchases.",

        "body": "Hello all, I'm very new to this subreddit and reddit in general. My acne was kind of bad in high school, but I thought it was cool to not care about my skin and I popped pimples often and didn't have any skincare routine. My parents did have me go to a dermatologist because they did care though. I don't think the dude knew what he was doing and despite trying some pills for a while I stopped taking those. I still use the BP and Differin now but at that time it's all I used.\n\nAnyway, I'm a junior in college now and for the most part I don't get that bad of acne anymore. Sometimes I'll wake up with 3-4 new pimples but usually it'll be just something small every day or two. I want to finish it completely though. My forehead is generally clean except for a few bumps near the eyebrows and above the nose. My cheeks don't often get new ones but this is where most of the redness and scarring is. New pimples mainly form around the jawline, sideburn area, and around the mouth (although since a few changes since discovering this two weeks ago, my chin has been great).\n\nI would like to continue the progress I've made, keep the new ones from forming (especially because I need to start shaving more often but I'm really scared to cause a breakout), and also get rid of the redness. I really think I'm still doing something wrong. My face looks like I have a bad sunglasses tanline and I want to eliminate that redness and start lightening the scarring because the scars have been there for a couple years and haven't significantly reduced in redness, although there still are occasional pimples in that area.\n\nMy routine is this: \nAM \n*Rinse with water \n*Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser (Began using a week or so ago from Clean and Clear Deep Action Cream Cleanser after reading here not to use products with alcohol in them. That seems to have helped as I haven't broken out this week.) \n*Prescription BP of 5% (Causes some flaking around the chin and mouth. Used to be much worse before I started using moisturizer and I would shave off the dead skin. It goes away after moisturizing though.) *Wait 15-20 minutes\n*CVS brand (comparable to Cetaphil) Moisturizing Lotion (I think I'm going to switch this out too, but I read here also to do one product at a time.)\nPM: \n*In shower\n*Same Fresh Foaming Cleanser from above. (On Saturday I use Clean and Clear Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub. I read not to exfoliate too often, I would do it more if it's recommended though. I've also only began this as of a week ago.) \n*Prescription Differin\n*Wait 15-20 minutes\n*Same moisturizer\n\nNotes: \n*I resumed taking Zinc supplements a week ago after stopping for 2 months \n*I never really use sunscreen on my face for fear of clogging pores/breaking out \n*My face generally gets greasy, on my cheeks especially, anywhere from 3-8 hours after washing. Sometimes I wake up with a greasy face and sometimes I don't. What's up with this? \n*I pat dry my face with a new paper towel after each wash to avoid irritation and using towels that touch other things. \n*I never really touch my face, I'm very conscious about it.\n\nSummary of questions: \n*How can I reduce the redness and not breakout?! (I've even been asked if I'm sunburned. That's gotta stop.) \n*How can I finish off the pimples that still form? \n*What should be corrected in my routine? \n*How can I shave without breaking out or mistakenly running over a forming pimple?\n*What is recommended for spot treatments of pimples that I notice forming?\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "I have seborrheic dermatitis which means my scalp gets oilier than most & produces buildup/flakes. Oils make it worse so I stopped using them altogether. Since my hair has reached shoulder length, I make sure to keep my skin oiled up so that as the ends of my locs rub against my skin, they're catching some moisture as well. As far as my scalp, I had to switch to using all natural & raw ingredients which has helped completely eliminate my symptoms along with dietary changes. I use raw African black soap bars to wash. I'm not talking about the commercial bars that are formulated. I'm talking about the raw bars imported from Ghana. I wash once a week as well as deep condition with raw aloe vera. I get the leaves from the store, wash them, slice them open, chop them up into squares & let them soak in cool water for about 20 mins before using. Then I just take them in the shower, peel the skin back & rub in circular motions on my scalp until I've gotten most of the gel out. Massage into your problem areas, place a shower cap & allow to sit for about 15-20 mins then rinse. For hydration daily I make my own herbal spritz with raw or dried herbs such as rosemary, cloves, ginger & nettle. \n\n As far as my diet goes, I've been intermittent fasting & practicing a low carb, no processed sugars diet for the past year. I noticed that my scalp health improved significantly within that time. Sugar feeds a lot of conditions & diseases so if all else fails, your diet may as well be the culprit too. \n\n If ur looking for a shampoo, I heard that T-Gel works amazing still. It's an old school shampoo. My dad had the same condition & used it but I never tried it personally, but I've seen others mention it in this sub! \n\nHope this helps!! 🙏",

    "body": "Extracts of Centella Asiatica can be present in skincare in a number of different forms:\n\n* Centella Asiatica Extract, which is powder or liquid extract from the plant\n* Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, which is a highly dilute extract created by soaking centella leaves in water\n* individual extracted triterpenoids (the phytochemicals in centella that are responsible for most of its beneficial effects) i.e. **madecassoside**, **asiaticoside**, **madecassic acid**, and **asiatic acid**\n* patented combinations of any of the above.\n\nCentella is effective at very low concentrations; even just 0.1% madecassoside has noted effects on the skin. However, it can be hard to tell exactly how much centella is included in product due to labelling laws, which (in both Korea and the US) allow ingredients under 1% to be arranged in any order. In addition, Korean products may order ingredients based on the total amount of the extract added to the formula rather than the individual ingredients in the extract. For example, even if the extract only contains 0.01% centella and is 99.99% glycerin, if you used 5% of that liquid in your serum, you would list the extract in the ingredients list as a 5% concentration. In contrast, in the US, individual sub-ingredients in an extract are ordered based on their individual concentration in the total formula. So you'd likely have glycerin at the top of the ingredients list and centella near the bottom.\n\nTo make things even more confusing, extracts can vary in strength based on extraction technique, the amount of the true plant extract included in the liquid by the manufacturer, and the season and location of the centella harvest.\n\nI really wanted a product with all four triterpenoids included (as they all have slightly different effects, apparently?) and/or a known, patented extract. The two extracts I focused on:\n\n* **TECA** (titrated extract of centella asiatica), which is a patented powder extract consisting of 40% asiaticoside, 30% madecassic acid, and 30% asiatic acid. Many of the studies on centella have used TECA in their experiments. It is an extremely pure extract (95% triterpenoids) so what you see is what you get, pretty much. If you see asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid listed in a formula sans madecassoside, it probably contains TECA (or possibly a similar extract made by a competitor called Plantactiv).\n* **Supercentella** is a newer liquid patented extract consisting of all 4 major centella triterpenoids - madecassoside, madecassic acid, asiaticoside, asiatic acid. I am not sure if it's 25:25:25:25 ratio or not. It is dissolved in water and butylene glycol, and is recommended to be added to formulas at 1-10% per the manufacturer.\n\nThe following products either contain TECA/Plantactiv, Supercentella, or have all four triterpenoids in their formula but don't state which specific extract was used. Most of these also contain additional Centella Extract and/or Centella Leaf Water. I excluded products with fragrance, citrus extracts, and EOs (other than tea tree oil).\n\n* **Sioris A Calming Day Ampoule** \\- 2% Supercentella and 1% Centella Extract.\n* **Sidmool Cicaheals Cream** \\- 0.9% TECA + 0.2% madecassoside\n* **Sidmool Good Spot Ointment** \\- 1% TECA + 0.5% madecassoside\n* **Sidmool Centella Lip Essence** \\- contains TECA + madecassoside (0.5% total)\n* **Sidmool Source Centella Powder** \\- contains 1.5% TECA, 0.5% madecassoside\n* **Sidmool Centella Essential Gel, Sidmool Madagascar Centella line, Galaktoside line, Dr Troub Sebumzero Centella Powder** \\- contain TECA + Madecassoside\n* **Sidmool Dr Troub Mild Toner and Zinc 25% Ampoule** \\- TECA\n* **Sidmool Macenna 115 Ampoule** \\- 1% Madecassoside + 1% TECA\n* **Skin&Lab Medicica line** \\- contains all 4 triterpenoids.\n* **skin1004 Madagascar Centella ampoule** \\- contains TECA\n* **Purito All-in-One Mild Pad**  \\- contains TECA.\n* **Purito Unscented Sunscreen** \\- contains Supercentella.\n* **Cosrx AC serum, spot cream, and toners** \\- contain TECA.\n* **Dr.G Red Blemish Clear Cream** \\- all 4 triterpenoids.\n* **Etude House SoonJung Sleeping Pack** \\- all 4 triterpenoids.\n* **Tosowoong Cica Repair Cream Madecare Ointment** \\- has 400mg \"centella quantitative extract\" per the KFDA, which I believe is TECA.\n* **so natural Madecare Ointment** \\- I'm 99% sure it's the same as the Tosowoong ointment.\n* **Crazyskin Tica Ample** \\- contains all 4 triterpenoids and I seem to remember the Korean advertising saying it contained Supercentella, but I can't remember for sure.\n* **Centellian24 Hair Tonic & Hair Loss Shampoo** \\- both contain TECA\n* **so natural Centella Magic Powder** \\- contains TECA\n* **2sol Tiger Powder** \\- contains TECA\n* **celimax JIWOOGAE Heartleaf BHA Peeling Pad** \\- contains all 4 triterpenoids\n\nThank you for reading!

In addition to all 4 triterpenoids, it also has polyglutamic acid, 2 forms of hyaluronic acid, panthenol, urea, and licorice!\n- Sidmool Good Spot Cream: I wanted something occlusive/ointment-y for spot treating, and I wanted to get at least one product with a disclosed concentration of the good stuff.\n- Sidmool Centella Lip Essence: I’ve been wanting an overnight lip mask for a while... why not a centella one?!\n\nI also grabbed some sample foils of the A’Pieu Madecassoside Gel and a tub of their Lip Sleeping Mask to try (I couldn’t decide if I wanted a lip balm or essence... why not both?!).",

I am now 20, and last year started using a feminine wash that was incredibly gentle and i absolutely loved it, i used it on my whole body and it helped with the eczema on my arms, and made my skin tone much more even, no dry skin.  I had also never used these products before so i was really skeptical, but it was so gentle and eventually i wondered how it would help the skin on my face. Since the first use i was completely obsessed, now 3 months later my skin is completely clear and i haven’t had a single breakout since using this. the only other thing i use is moisturizer with spf in it.  It’s VH essentials tea tree oil wash, i get it at my local CVS or walmart (located in the midwest in the US) it’s genuinely saved my confidence and my skin, and felt like i needed to share this somewhere.",

    "body": "So far I've bought you such wonderful tales from my online store and a recent comment from my mother about what I used to sell bought up new memories of a much simpler time. \n\nBefore my store really expanded into what it is now, I used to sell a few smaller ranges of Pop Culture items. One of these was wall stickers or decals, usually depicting the latest princess or superhero. \n\nThey came in from my supplier in flimsy plastic packaging and I used to take them out and roll them up in hardy cardboard tubes for postage- the instructions were carefully cut out of the packet and inserted into the tube. I also had a disclaimer on the item page that if they need more information on how to use the item to let me know as I had a PDF version as well and could answer any questions as I used to practice with the items (ones that were damaged in transit) so I knew all about my product. \n\nIt was coming up to Christmas and business was booming, I guess because the stickers made great gifts. I'm just about to put up my holiday message explaining I will be away until *this date* so things will not be posted until *that date* when I get a frantic email from a woman wanting *random superhero* sent to her express as a last minute gift. \n\nAs I'm not a total scrooge, I work with her and we get the payment cleared and the item posted and I happily go on my holidays. \n\nTHREE MONTHS LATER this woman emails me in a fit, because her decal is broken and won't adhere to the walls. I ask for pictures to see if there is anything I can do. The first is the gratuitous shot of the thing all crumpled on the floor, then one of the blank wall. I look closer at the wall and see this sheen on it, but assume it's probably fresh paint. \n\nWe go through the standard questions about how she applied it. Somewhere down the line, this woman starts getting more and more aggravated. She is calling me all the names under the sun, accusations of not including instructions are thrown around etc etc. \n\nBy now I'm losing my patience. BUT THEN she lets out the first slip up. \n\nShe admits she kept it in the tube the whole time in her carport. In Australia. Over Christmas. In 40C heat. I explain that maybe the glue has been compromised, having been in direct sunlight for three months. She sends me a reply in all caps that it isn't her fault, but it is a fault with the product AND SHE KNOWS BECAUSE WHEN SHE PULLED IT OUT OF THE TUBE, THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE MELTED INTO IT. By now, I'm more interested in what else she has been telling fibs about, so I dig a little deeper.\n\nI ask if she read the instructions on preparing the wall. I usually advise people to lightly wash the wall with diluted detergent and water or a sugar soap solution. The woman replies that she did not have any on hand so she used- and I am not kidding- tea tree oil mixed with a little eucalyptus oil (because that makes the wall sterile, duh!). \n\nMy product had a removable glue on it, but the formula is a bit funky to explain, but let me tell you this. Anything like tea tree or eucalyptus oil (or rubbing alcohol, I've also had once) will strip the glue and make it kind of useless. \n\nBy this point, I am done. I email her back asking her to look at the \"tips\" section of the instruction list. I ask her to type it out for me. She types back that she can't be expected to read *all* the instructions.\n\nI emailed her back that as it was outside my 30 day refund and she voided her warranty with the item by blatantly ignoring instructions, there was nothing else I could help her with. \n",

You all have been underplaying the effectiveness of persimmon soap! \n\nI have been fighting for the last six years with a neverending, weird armpit smell. I tried every soap in the store and some I found online. I found a tea tree oil soap that successfully helped me a lot with some other issues which I am thankful for. But, this persimmon soap? Come on! It's freakin' magical! I ordered some of the Mirai soap (and shampoo) and it arrived today. I just got out of the shower and can I tell you? No more weird pit smell! After SIX freaking years! I even had my (very amazing, perhaps gullible, loving partner) smell my pits. He couldn't detect any odor. Like, AT ALL.  \n\nI'd like to reassure any of you sensitive-to-smell folks (absolutely include myself in this group), this one will pass the bill. The bar soap smells like the original Neutragena orange bar soap but not quite as potent. When lathered, the Neutragena smell becomes less pronounced and it has an extremely light, almost sweet, slightly fruity smell. I don't know what an actual persimmon smells like but my guess is that's what it smells like, but I promise it is the faintest of smells. It doesn't linger after the shower so you won't go around town smelling like a fruit stand.\n\nIf you were debating on this soap, please do not wait. Yes, it's pricey, but it's worth it. I certainly could have saved myself a lot of money and time if I had known about this soap earlier. Believe the hype. It's amazing. Buy it, then come back and tell me how much you love it and how it has solved all of your problems! 😄  \n\nLove to all the odoriferous emanaters out there! ❤️",

    "body": "So, this might be TMI for some, but I felt like I had to share incase someone else is feeling this way and wants to stop freaking out.\n\nFor the last few months, I have had what feels like bugs crawling in my pubic hair. \n\nI freaked out, thinking I had picked something up from traveling recently. I did everything...Took a mirror and looked for pubic lice, shaved all my hair off and used tea tree oil, looked at my underwear with a magnifying glass to see if anything was crawling on them. I reduced my sugar intake because I knew it produced oil in our hair follicles that feed the mites that live on us. I took Ivermectin for mites/lice. You name it...I tried it.\n\nToday I was like...I can't take this anymore. I told my husband that I wanted him to look with a magnifying light that I use for sewing. I told him if he did not see any signs of bugs, bites, eggs, skin irritation...etc., that I was just going to stop freaking out and accept it. (Note: good marriage no infidelity issues. Super supportive husband) He got down there looked and came to the same conclusion I did...there was nothing crawling on my girl parts.\n\nToday I searched again for bug crawling sensations with no bug found and found \"Formication\". This time I saw \"menopause\" as one of the reasons!!! I was like W T F!!! My brain is still like...yeah right...it has to be bugs. \n\nBut I guess it makes sense since that part of the body is endowed with estrogen and the sensation is caused by decreasing levels of estrogen...from what I read.\n\nI had a hysterectomy 4 yrs ago and recently turned 50. I kept my ovaries and knew that menopause was coming potentially sooner than later, but I had no idea that it would make my crotch feel like I had bugs crawling all over it.\n\nI watched a video today of a woman who thought she felt spiders and spider webs on her face and neck and that once she knew the cause of it...the symptoms went away. I sure hope that is the case for me.\n\nAnyhow...it is a little embarrassing to share, but I am because I was freaking out, and if I can help just one person not freak out as much as I did...it is worth it.\n\nSo, for those who have or have had this (on any part of your body)...what helped? What did not help?\n\nI really would like to be able to relax and sleep at night. \n\nThank you",

In half a year you can put the ring back in. Cartilage piercings are pretty moody, so having a labret long term may be the best bet.

I just posted asking for set up advice so if you like that stuff help LOL \n\nI know my image comes up on google when searching for this, so I figured I would re-put-it-out-into-the-internet and let you all know that it's been 100% healed for YEARS now! I've attached the original photo as well as a new one taken today; let this be your sign to NEVER GIVE UP! Please leave any questions- please ask(!), but here's what worked for me.\n1. COMPLETELY DRYING my piercing after showers.\nThis was really important for me, as I play video games often after my showers and found that the moisture was making the bump worse. I just let it air dry, but I have used the hair dryer method before and found it made the pain way worse.\n2. NOT SLEEPING ON IT! My BIGGEST tip for this is making sure you sleep with an airplane pillow. If you're a back sleeper, the \"standard\" way of using an airplane pillow works perfect, but if you're a side sleeper like myself then using it by placing it flat and putting your ear inside the hole it works WONDERS! They also sell \"piercing pillows\" which is basically the same thing but there's no button in the middle to open it up.\n3. DON'T TOUCH IT. Seriously leave it the fuck alone.\n4. DOWNSIZING MY JEWELRY. Idk why this worked for me but it did. I was pierced with a 14g and took it down to a 16g. It worked!\n5. KNOW YOUR BODY. I know that I CANNOT HEAL WITH HOOPS IN. lok why, and I know that most piercings should never be originally pierced with a hoop, but the daith usually is (at least in my experience). I swapped it out for a curved barbell and she was so much happier.\n6. PUT NOTHING BUT SALINE ON IT. I rinsed that bitch in the shower, then saline right after twice a day. LET IT DRY. But don't try any bullshit you see or hear online to get rid of them quicker. If you ever come across my original post, I had tried tea tree oil which made it somehow worse. I think I used incorrect dosing which absolutely fucked my already fucked up situation. Don't do it. My piercer had suggested it at the time but didn't give me measurements, so this might've just been my piercer being an idiot by not letting me know how to do it.\n7. BE PATIENT.\nAgain, PLEASE feel free to ask for any advice or tips; I'm no professional but happy to try to help! Hopefully this gives you a little confidence to keep up the fight! It gets better :D\n",

First it started on the upper side, then it calmed down and then the lower side. The lower side gave me false hope since out of nowhere the bump on the lower side became pretty big (not as big as the ones on your picture but pretty big in this whole journey). It’s not red but like a very light fleshy color. Doesn’t hurt but looks pretty nasty. I don’t even know what size my horseshoe is T-T. I was wondering whether you changed your jewelry with exactly those bumps. And when did you change your piercing? I think it might be too early for me to change it :(.

YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!! \n\n[FIND A PIERCER HERE ](https://safepiercing.org/) \n\n[HOW TO FIND GOOD NON APP PIERCERS](https://www.lynnloheide.com/post/portfolios-how-to-find-a-good-piercer) \n\nand even if you did you do not have an autoclave to sterilize jewelry and tools/equipment. If you didn’t get your piercing done by a professional piercer in a studio (not people who call themselves piercers and will pierce anyone naive to pay them. They do not count) ‼️‼️‼️LITERALLY TAKE IT OUT‼️‼️‼️ if it’s not infected and you’re having problems with it DONT EVEN BOTHER just remove it let it heal while continuing to rinse with saline and then get it repierced professionally. \n\nLet’s start! You probably don’t have an infection!!!!!!! An infection is a very hot ear/nose/skin etc with white yellow or green pus you may run a fever or develop a pimple looking pustule. To clear an infection you can only use two things: your immune system and antibiotics. Anything else is ineffective.  \n‼️‼️YOU MUST SEE A DOCTOR IF YOU SUSPECT INFECTION‼️‼️‼️\n\nNow what’s an irritation bump? An irritation bump is a little hard discoloured bump that develops around the sight of the piercing it happens for these few common reasons\n\n🌟🌟READ THIS CAREFULLY ALMOST ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES ARE LISTED HERE IF YOU STILL CANNOT RESOLVE THE ISSUES CONSIDER REMOVING THE PIERCING🌟🌟\n\n1.) you’re allergic to the jewelry!! Always pierce with implant grade titanium\n\n2. You have BAD jewelry always pierce with internally threaded titanium NEVER EXTERNAL\n\n    2a almost every piercing is pierced with a flat back labret jewelry (a stud that screws on) it’s a straight barbell NOT RINGS This is fantastic!\nOne note for 2a - some cartilage barbell piercings should have a ball or M&M shaped backing, not a flat labret-style back. The latter tends to collect more crusties/cause irritation.\n\n    2b here are some locations where they use a curved bar: rook, anti tragus’ navel  eyebrow. Daiths and septum’s can start with a ring. Septum’s can also start with circular barbells/ horseshoes \n\n    2c. For navels make sure your tummy rolls do not collapse on your belly button if you do you must get a floating navel or you WILL get a bump from your ring constantly being squished and pushed upwards \n\n    2d. bar length!! The bar was too short to accommodate swelling ORRR you didn’t downsize after the swelling went down and the bar began to catch on things \n\n3.) you were pierced at a bad angle sometimes bad angles have trouble healing because they go through more skin and or they’re in a position where it’s constantly catching in things THIS IS A VERY COMMON CAUSE FOR PIERCING BUMPS SO PLEASE SEE APP OR REPUTABLE PIERCERS \n\n    3A) you should almost always be pierced perpendicular to your anatomy it should be at a 90 degree angle!!!! \n\n    3b) pierced on the surface they eventually reject anyways \n\n    3c) ‼️‼️NEVER LET ANYONE PIERCE YOU WITH A GUN‼️‼️‼️ guns can shatter cartilage and harbour bacteria. Piercers should autoclave your jewelry and the needle should come in a sterile pack google what an autoclave is and look for it  \n\n4) you slept on it (get a travel pillow ofc)\n\n5)  your hair got caught in it (headbands are great solutions)\n\n6) incorrect cleaning!!! Rinse with sterile saline or wound wash it should have no additives!! Pat dry with non woven gauze but personally the shitty brown paper towels work just fine You do not need to soak it and do not use your own salt water but saline !!!\n\n7) you were messing with it. Piercings heal by forming a fistula around the ring. This is scar tissue you need to leave it still so it can form this scar tissue if you twist it or push it around your essentially ripping your fistula apart\n\n    7a) don’t take out piercings while healing other than to downsize the bar. it will irritate the wound and it can just close if you take it out for a while \n\nLet’s move on to the rest :)\n\nWhen you’re healing a wound you want to keep it dry as in you don’t wanna submerge it in water!!!!! or leave it moist long enough for bacteria to fester and grow. however you want to maintain your skins natural moisture levels. When you use alcohol it evaporates water in your skin and dries it out too much when it’s this dries your skin cells die out and it doesn’t heal as well.  Alcohol is great for cleaning unbroken skin or maybe even a minor scrape and cuts and abrasions (anything on the first layer of skin is fine) but not for piercing wounds they’re very deep and you pierce through your actual flesh. Your flesh is very fragile to harsh chemicals like alcohol\n\nNow like I said earlier you want to maintain your skins natural moisture so no creams or oils!!!! In fact creams and oils are often nutrient rich and WET and will attract more bacteria. they’ll also trap dirt and the skin cells your skin is attempting to shed. Never put them directly on piercings. Now neosporin is a papular cream for minor cuts and abrasions but you don’t need it it’s just a mini antibiotic your body heals fine on it’s own and honestly sometimes Vaseline does the damn job for burns and stuff.\n\nOnto keloids!!! Rule of thumb If you think you have a keloid you probably don’t. A keloid is genetic scarring disorder you are born with it and you usually know since someone in your family might OR you’re a person of colour darker skinned people like black people tend to have keloids genetically. And they NEVER go away without clinical treatment sometimes they grow forever.  They tend to have their own blood supply and be a bit squishy. If you’ve had an irritation bump for longer than a year  or have a history or family history of keloids or anything I mention in this section. you should consider it’s not an irritation bump. If you’ve tried everything above and you were pierced perfectly maybe it is a keloid!! if you did have a keloid you would be receiving rounds of corticosteroids under clinical supervision depending on your case. Some doctors will cut it off freeze it off or laser it off but I guarantee your store bought cream did not do the job.\n\nSaline rinses great point there let’s look into it!! Saline isn’t really SUPPOSED to do anything that’s like the whole point if you know what I mean. Saline is great because your human body has the same salt concentration as saline so again you are maintaining your natural body’s composition. It’s called homeostasis if you wanna learn more!! What it does is just give your piercing a good rinse and bring it back to the usual. And what’s cool is salt is antimicrobial too!!! But the perfect amount of salt just for you eh! and let me also mention some people get “saline solutions” that have other stuff in them you don’t want any additives it should only have sodium chloride (chemical name for salt) and water!! So who knows\n    \n       ‼️‼️‼️That means no tea tree oil no alcohol no hydrogen peroxide nothing!!!! just saline only‼️‼️‼️\n\n🖤🖤Don’t be afraid to ask your piercer about the standards for oral genital and nipple piercings they may require fitting different kinds of jewelry and/or after care that are different than this general post. but theres tons of more information on these websites: https://www.lynnloheide.com/blog and https://www.safepiercing.org/safe_piercing_faq.php and https://pierced.co/blogs/all \n\nHere’s a food for thought if you’ve ever had your wisdom teeth out a surgery or anything like that think what would you do and what would your doctor say about it\n\nThanks for reading !!! ...",

I use it as recommended by my piercer, but sometimes it ends up leaving some threads (idk how ;;) but it's the only thing I can clean it with... As for paper i'm too afraid it contains bacteria since paper isn't usually in a closed environment so I'm always afraid it has bacteria... What should I do?\n\n2- you talked about not leaving your piercing wet but I have a nostril so it's kinda inevitable that it's humid... Is this bad? It's really hard to keep it dry all the time since it's in a humid spot. \n\n3- still about cleaning. (Sorry for the tmi in advance) I get snot stuck to my piercing a LOT. The snot is usually dry, even after showering. Now, I know I shouldn't force anything but I don't feel safe leaving snot there (since it can attract bacteria or not allow the hole to breathe) but it requires some effort and nostril-bending to get to the snot. Should I leave it or force it a little to stay clean even tho it's probably the cause of my bubble?\n\n4- About the ammount of times I should clean my piercing. Everyone says once to twice a day. Does it depend on your routine? Like, if you go out it's better to clean it twice but if you stay home once is enough?\n\nExcellent post btw!!

    "body": "I see a fair amount of posts on here recommending stocking up on prescription drugs and other medical items in the case of an extended crisis. I cannot agree more, but there are some items I don't see listed much that have been extremely helpful to me. For context, I spent years living as a busker/traveler/odd jobs. I was basically a hobo. I have since spent years living off grid in the woods. A lot of this stuff might fall under the category of herbal/\"alternative\" medicine, but I only share it because I have tested it and it works. I am not arguing you should replace conventional medicine with these things; if anything consider having them on hand should stocks of conventional medicine run out.\n\nNuSkin or Super Glue - used for sutures. Many people already know about this, but it's worth a mention.\n\nIodine - disinfectant, and sterilization of water for drinking.\n\nActivated Charcoal - this is the hobo remedy for giardia - the parasite that lives in most fresh water. It works - I had the misfortune of contracting that once. It is also used to absorb poison to keep it from going into the bloodstream. Safe for animals.\n\nWhole clove/clove oil - besides being a pest repellent, this is the preferred hobo treatment for toothaches. I have been told that holding a whole clove over the problem tooth for long enough will permanently kill the nerve. Fortunately my teeth aren't that bad but I know it dulls the pain considerably.\n\n* Edit - It's been pointed out in the comments that killing the nerve is a myth. Also it should go without saying to see a dentist if possible, as tooth abscesses are more than painful and a serious threat to your health! This is meant for those times where a dentist is unavailable for whatever reason.\n\nGoldenseal powder - Antibacterial. I suffered for months with staph that came back after each round of antibiotics. It was awful. I did not realize how close I was to dying. Finally someone told me this is what I needed. Depending on the infection you apply it to the skin, gargle, or take capsules - I took three a day and the staph that was systemic in my blood cleared up in four or five days. It's important that the powder is good. Lots of crappy supplements out there. It should be yellow green and staining, have a very strong smell and bitter taste. I am pretty sure it saved my life and know others with similar stories. Be mindful, because I'm told the plant itself is getting over-harvested.\n\nNu Stock - this is a wound dressing for animals you can find in feed stores. It is a mixture of sulfur and pine oil. It has a strong smell, but is like a miracle cure for rashes, burns, lesions, etc, while killing parasites like fleas. It was the only thing that helped my old dog's skin and I've used it on my own burns and poison oak rashes and it works better than anything.\n\nEye drops - just a good prep that's often overlooked. In the event of a disaster, being able to wash debris from your eyes could make a big difference.\n\nLemon Eucalyptus oil - this is the best pest repellent, though runner ups are things like tea tree oil and cedar oil. Another option is to mix water with ash and rub that on your skin, though that doesn't look pretty and will dry you out. It works though!\n\nSome other random things that people may not think of that can be really helpful are:\n\nHaving a dedicated spray/mister bottle for clean water - endless uses and conserves water really well.\n\nHave a steel guitar sting - the wire is just strong and flexible enough to come in handy for cleaning a miriad of things, whether mechanical parts or other hard to reach places. It's a weird item but takes up almost no space.\n\nIt might also be worth having some kind of product containing permethrin (like sargent's dog shampoo or such) in your preps, maybe even in your bug out bag. In the event of a disaster, if you end up at an evacuation center or something, parasites are a real risk, and I can tell you from experience that they reeeaally suck. Permethrin is not something to mess around with, but it will kill parasites, and dog shampoo is super cheap.",

    "body": "#THINGS TO AVOID\n\n - DO NOT SCRATCH\n - DO NOT USE TYPICAL SUNBURN RELIEF CREAMS (aloe, generic moisturizers, etc)\n - DO NOT USE OIL-BASED TOPICALS (make sure any remedies below are NOT oil-based; peppermint seems to be the exception)\n - DO NOT USE WET OR DAMP CLOTH\n\n___\n\n##**IF YOU HAVE IT NOW, AND HAVE ALREADY TRIED ALOE**\n###Long, intense (*very hot* or *very cold*) shower or bath, followed by peppermint oil rub. \n\n* The shower will offer temporary, but immediate relief, while washing off any other topical ointments. Use with CAUTION, as it CAN make the itch worse once the relief is gone, but seems to be the best way to offer an immediate respite.\n* Oatmeal baths (even lukework) are also occasionally mentioned. Same CAUTION here; only do so if you've already tried other methods to the surface of the skin, as it can make it WORSE once you get out.\n\n___\n\n##**IF YOU HAVE IT NOW**\n\n###AVOID SHOWERS & ANYTHING APPLIED TO THE SKIN\nAlthough a very hot or very cold shower can help reduce the intensity in the short term, the intensity of the itch will likely increase within minutes after the shower. Take ONLY as necessary (or when waiting for oral remedies to kick in).\n\n###Betamethasone (Celestone) Injection\n\n* An injection of the corticosteroid Betamethasone (celestone) has been reported by a few to stop HI completely.\n* In the US, the injection requires a doctor's visit (show them [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/26/1/tay124/5180068) if they don't believe you), while the cream & oral variations require a prescription.\n\n###Antihistamine & Ibuprofen\n\n* This combination is consistently reported as the best method for longer term relief. Typically used in combination with something below, as you will have to wait for its affects.\n\n* Diphenhydramine (Benedryl in he US) seems to be the most effective. The variation found in the UK is a third-gen variant, but both are still found over-the-counter.\n\n###Anti Itch (Cooling) Spray\n\n* This has been corroborated by a few others already, so it's worth putting on the main list.\n\n###Vitamin A&D Cream. \n\n* THIS WILL CAUSE A FLARE UP LIKE OTHER TOPICALS. If you're already at your limit, hold off on this. If you've reached a point where you can deal, it will help with long term relief, and could reduce the duration of the itch overall.\n\n###Talc(um) Powder\n\n*Referenced once; specifically mentioned was Dr. Scholl's Soothing Foot Powder. Keep in mind this is only effective while it's actively on the skin. Further tests from the users showed any talcum powder-based product (eg: baby powder) was also effective*\n\n###Beta-alanine (experimental)\n\n* An OTC pre-workout supplement you can find at most vitamin shops. Referenced by some HI researches contacted by [another user](/r/HellsItch/comments/1l0z1xz/this_stopped_hells_itch_for_my_son_and_university/). Mention in this thread if this had a positive effect for you to bump it up the list!\n\n\n___\n\n##**IF YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET IT**\n\n### DRINK WATER, TAKE IBUPROFEN, TAKE ANTI-HISTAMINES\n\n* This will help reduce general inflammation and reduce the histamine that is likely the root cause. Combine this with the below cream, and you might be able to avoid the itch altogether.\n\n### APPLY Vitamin A&D cream on the FIRST DAY (day of sunburn/directly after)\n\n* /u/judascrinitus has a [great write up](/r/HellsItch/comments/4w2sly/ad_doing_the_trick_for_me/), while /u/ninshakjr has used it as a [preemptive measure](/r/HellsItch/comments/4gh11d/experienced_veteran_kinda/). They later comment that it did indeed help reduce the pain.\n\n### DRINK LOTS OF WATER\n\n* This will help reduce dryness often caused by sunburns that can reduce the impact of the itch.\n\n___\n\n###All measures referenced\n\n##Primary Goal:\n\n*Pressure & Temperature can overload your bodies ability to send pain signals, but need to be intense enough to do so. Medications can override your sense of pain or just knock you out, but you should always be careful with these methods. Your best bet is to use some pressure / temperature method for immediate relief until a medicated approach kicks in.*\n\n**INTERNAL PAIN RELIEF**\n\n* **Ibuprofen** can reduce overall pain and inflammation, and is great for pre-itch-care. It's better to take it in conjunction with something else.\n* **Antihistamines** seem to work, but this seems to be hit-or-miss with people. Diphenhydramine has been mentioned. Most useful when taken in conjunction with something else, or if  you want to just pass out (eg: nyquil /  benedryl)\n* **Trees** If it's legal and accessible to you, smoking marijuana is a proven general pain reliever.\n\n**DIRECT APPLICATION**\n\n* Keep in mind any direct application WILL cause the itch to intensify. If you have already *tried* something applied to the skin, these are likely candidates to help reduce the itch. ALWAYS spot-check first, and wait 15-20 minutes. If you have not, **THE BEST ADVICE IS TO NOT APPLY ANYTHING TO THE SKIN**\n\n* **[Benadryl Itch-Stopping Gel](/r/HellsItch/comments/8ygbvj/13_years_later_this_is_still_a_thing_for_me/)** - [product link](https://www.benadryl.com/products/benadryl-itch-stopping-gel-extra-strength) - By far one of the most effective & referenced short-term treatments.\n* **Vitamin A&D** Some accounts have mentioned this may prevent the itch, or at least reduce the length of time the itch occurs.\n* ***Lidocaine creams*** can numb the skin, but may only be so effective. **WARNING** Some people benefit from this, while for others it has made the itch WORSE. Try a small amount first.\n* **Peppermint Oil** This is a direct application, but acts as a way to trick your body into sensing temperature.\n* **Tea Tree Oil** See above\n* **[IcyHot](/r/HellsItch/comments/4ylqvd/remedies_most_common_effective/d7a8pk1/)** See above\n* **[Talcum Powder](/r/HellsItch/comments/6qo8yn/i_got_hells_itch_for_the_first_time_tonight/)** - The product used was Dr Scholl's Foot Powder, but baby powder will also work. Effective only [while actively on the skin](/r/HellsItch/comments/6qo8yn/i_got_hells_itch_for_the_first_time_tonight/dkzu1yb/).\n\n* *One-off references below*\n* **[Sarna Anti Itch Spray](https://www.sarna-skincare.com/index.html)**\n* **[Mitchum deodorant](/r/HellsItch/comments/5ck71k/my_experience/)**\n* **[Witch Hazel](/r/HellsItch/comments/8o146l/witch_hazel_as_a_possible_remedy/)**\n\n\n**PRESSURE**\n\n* Wrap the area in a dry cloth & apply pressure by leaning against a surface or laying down.\n* Heavy or weighted blankets\n* Tightly wrapping yourself in a towel, and leaning against something; just don't shift.\n\n**TEMPERATURE**\n\n* **Ice Packs**\n * Condensation from plastic or ice water can inflame the area further once the ice is removed.\n * Another warning on this: Ice on the skin will eventually do more damage than the itch feels like it's doing. Removing the ice, especially after a couple hours, will result in a lot more pain due to returning circulation, so have something else to aid relief if you can.\n* **Heating Pad**\n* **Blow dryer on hot**\n* **HOT SHOWER** (for immediate, but short term, relief)\n * The most common way to get immediate relief, especially if you've mistakenly tried something that has made it worse. Typically paired with a [peppermint oil](/r/HellsItch/comments/4ylqvd/remedies_most_common_effective/dbfegmq/) application directly after, or when waiting for internal remedies (antihistamine / ibuprofen) to take effect.\n\n\n\n___\n\n####Other common questions\n\n**How long will this last?**\n\n***First-degree sunburns*** (no blisters)\n\nThis is proportional to the burn: very **mild, light pink** will last **a few hours**. More **intense, deep burns** can easily be **up to 72 hours**. 5 days has been the longest, consistent itch.\n\n***Second-degree sunburns*** (blisters & other skin damage)\n\nThis is a much more intense, but drawn-out experience. Thankfully Hell's Itch tends to last only a few hours at a time in this scenario, but can flare up for weeks after the initial burn, but while the body is healing. Keep A&D cream on hand for when you're not dealing with the itch; be careful with showers; and have anti-histamine's on hand for flare ups.\n\n***Post-Traumatic-Itch*** (or: \"will this come back??\")\n\nIt's not uncommon to experience 'phantom hells itch' well after the burn itself is healed or peeling has started. This is likely due to the added inflammation or dryness from the burn itself, but also the body being hyper-aware of itching sensations, and the brain immediately being terrified. Physically, keep hydrated, & the skin moisturized. Mentally, just remind yourself the the HI is **gone** once peeling starts, and breathe through those moments of terror.\n\n**Will this happen if I get sunburned again?*\n\nIf you are generally inactive in the sun, or have not had a sunburn in the affected area *that season*, the likely answer is yes. Although skin-tone can help prevent a sunburn in the first place, if you *do* get burned, the result is unfortunately consistent.\n\n**WHY???**\n\nThe most likely cause (in a cruel twist of irony) appears to be a **lack of sun exposure** in the affected area.^(see disclaimer)\n\nThis has been anecdotally corroborated by [previous experience](/r/HellsItch/comments/gjqjkh/localized_hells_itch/), and even by a second-hand [doctor's account](/r/HellsItch/comments/m216w5/a_doctors_advice/gqgwgpi/).\n\nIn order to prevent HI before a sunburn, the post above mentions at least ***second hand*** sun exposure. eg: hanging out in swimwear beneath the shade, and allowing indirect sunlight (via the water's surface) to reflect.

So wish I had this 17 years ago when I first had my reaction! I will say though 100% peppermint oil is a miracle with this and I wish the post pointed that out more. It causes a few minutes of hell after applying, but gives you maybe 6 hours of relief before needing reapplied again. By far the best remedy and only lasting remedy I’ve found in those 17 years dealing with it!\n\nAlso as a side note, I believe this may be a possible type of auto immune reaction that causes hells itch. Seems that the UV may cause damage to the cells in a way that cause the body to attack itself, causing the itch. That’s just my theory though and I hope doctors research this more one day.",

        "body": "So grateful this sub exists! Just went through HI for the first time after getting a sunburn on my back at very high elevation. Unrelenting, stabbing pain! Scalding hot showers and baths worked wonders. Disregard everything any medical website has to say on the issue, as they are all clueless. DO NOT USE ALOE or any other lotion. All were a grave mistake, in my experience, and I had to take hot showers to remove anything topical each time it was tried. Ibuprofen worked great! Tylenol not so much. Benedryl was okay, but not sure how much this really helped. CBD/THC was somewhat helpful maybe, but again, difficult to determine. Ice packs worked only while actively on the skin, but the stabbing resumed immediately after removal. Peppermint oil was too strong/burning for my sensitive skin. Benzodiazepines, if you happen to have them, are an aboslute lifesaver, as they seem to dull the body's reactivity to the pain/inflammation. Alcohol helps immensely as well, as it acts similarly. Take care combining those two, however. Have a couple drinks, then wait a few hours to take one dose of anxiety med (if you have it). If you wake up in the night with pain again, take ibuprofen, then a quick scalding shower directed at the spot. I now seem to be on the mend, and if it comes back, I know what to do. Good luck and god help you, fellow sufferers!",

When you get out, Even if the Benadryl hasn't helped the itching... At least you're now sleepy. \n\nIn all of the years of experiencing hell's itch, I've found that there is no lotion or anything that ABSOLUTELY does it for everyone.... However, a hot shower and alcohol always do the trick. Trust me. If you get sunburned, be ready. the itch could come for you at the 12/24/36/48 hour mark...

        "body": "Thought I would post my current first time experience here.\n\nFirst of all, I'm in my late 30s, very light skinned and burn fairly easily. Since a child, I've always been very cautious to spend much time in the sun without sunscreen, and rarely without my shirt (even while swimming).\n\nWent on a family vacation to Florida this past week and was very careful to use sunblock, save for Sunday when we went to the Atlantic Ocean. I didn't put on much sunblock as we didn't plan to spend more than 2 hours at the beach. After about 3 hours, we went back to where we were staying, and my wife commented on how bad my sunburn looked. It felt like any normal sunburn, and she put our usual Aveeno lotion on my back after we showered. \n\nLater that evening, my upper back and shoulders began to lightly hurt. I thought it was just normal sunburn pain and had my wife rub more Aveeno lotion on it. It was very uncomfortable, but I was \"tough\" and made it through the night. \n\nMonday morning, upper back and shoulders mildly hurt. After the morning shower, wife rubbed in more Aveeno lotion. It hurt just a little more than the night before. Wife asked if I wanted some Ibuprofen. I rarely take pain meds, but with a 2 day drive ahead of us, I decided to take the Ibuprofen. Mild discomfort while driving, but not too bad. \n\nLater that evening, about 30 hours from leaving the beach, wife lotion me again with the Aveeno and I took more Ibuprofen. Pain was more than mild, but subsided enough when the Ibuprofen took affect for me to fall asleep. \n\nTuesday morning went about the same as the day before. Up to this point, I thought this was just a normal sunburn pain. Had to take Ibuprofen halfway through the day.\n\nTuesday night (tonight as of this writing), we made it home from Florida. Unloaded the car, did typical stuff you do when getting home from vacation. But, the sunburn pain on my upper back and shoulders was getting really intense. This was about 54 hours after leaving the beach. I told my wife I needed her to put Aveeno lotion on my back, she told me in just a few minutes after she takes care of the kids. Normally I would help her with the kids, but the sunburn pain was beginning to take over my thought process. So I waited a few minutes for her to finish with the kids. \n\nBut the pain was getting more intense by the second. I finally told her to stop with the kids and please put some lotion on my back. So she gently rubbed some Aveeno lotion on my back and arms. It seemed that when she would stop rubbing, this overwhelming intense pain in my upper back and shoulders would begin to overcome me. It was a pain like I had never experienced. If I touched the part where there was pain, it would temporarily go away, like scratching does to an itch. I was starting to loose sanity. The pain sensation would not stop. My wife began looking at me like I was crazy. I had never experienced this in my life. It was so bad, I sent my kids to their rooms, as I did not want them to see me loosing my sanity. I was rolling in pain on the floor, trying to Google what was going on. But I could not even concentrate on my phone long enough to read the Google results.\n\nI felt like I was ready to die! I took 4 Ibuprofen tablets (not sure how many mg that is, but at this point, I didn't care). I knew that lightly touching it provided some very temporary relief (like I compared before as scratching an itch) so I decided to take a shower and hoped I could manage till the Ibuprofen started to take affect. Tried both hot and cold water. Hot seemed to offer the best relief. After a 30 minute shower, I could feel the Ibuprofen beginning to do its job. \n\nAs I was Googling for solutions, medical sites were worthless! They all sited this was a rare condition with little scientific study. But after scrolling through a few sites, I ran across a blog [Excruciatin Pinprick Pain Days After Sunburn](https://medium.com/@RantNinja/excruciating-pinprick-pain-days-after-sunburn-e2f22d414481) and eventually to this Reddit. \n\nAs of right now, I'd say my Hell's Itch pain is at a manageable 4 on a 1 to 10 pain scale with the Ibuprofen. I'll update this post to further document my journey on the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life.",

I got moderately burned on my back and shoulders, and it stung like a normal sunburn on Tuesday and Wednesday night. On Thursday I went for another 30 minute swim in the sea - this time wearing suncream and a t-shirt. The swim was lovely, but when I got out the itch began. I've never felt anything like it before, it was so unpleasant, I wanted to tear my skin off.\n\nMy wife applied various creams including after-sun, a moisturizer, and vaseline, which didn't seem to help. I then went for a 5 hour long cold bath - this seemed to stop the itch, but as soon as I got out it came back. Then I found this subreddit. I took Ibuprofen and anti-histamine (loratadine, which is all I had) and had a long hot shower.

Normally I don't have someone help me put on sunblock because I usually buy aerosol sunblock that you can spray easily yourself - but I didn't have any at the time because I couldn't take it through my carryon luggage.\n\nFirst couple days it was just sensitive, we put on aloe gel on the burn area. I took a lukewarm shower yesterday and this needle itchyness started. It's enough to drive me crazy at times when it's at its peak (ebbs and flows) and when I woke up at 3 am I couldn't fall back asleep until 6 am when I passed out from exhaustion. I must have a mild version because I can still think fairly clearly and mostly operate normally, but the needle itchy stabbing is crazy, I've never felt it before. Usually sunburns are more like a mosquito bite itch. The weird thing is I mostly feel the needles on my upper and lower back where I'm *not* burnt, I'm not sure if that's due to not putting aloe gel on that portion of my back or what. Putting aloe gel on now doesn't seem to make it better or worse. The most effective thing so far is light pressure, such as laying on my back or laying against the back of a chair (which I'm doing as I write this right now).\n\nAfter doing some research and finding this sub, I took 2 zyrtec and 2 ibuprofen, and will take 2 benadryl at night, hopefully that helps me sleep and reduces the itchyness. I will update when it's over and I can say what worked/didn't in my anecdotal experience.\n\nUpdate: Slept pretty well at night (finally) and woke up to the itch mostly gone. Opted not to take any antihistamines after doing some research and not wanting to give myself antihistamine poisoning.

Well I recently read about using Jojoba Oil and a few drops of tea tree oil to put on the infected area, and what do you know, it worked!\n\nI was having a conversation with my other stripper friend the other day, and told her how great it worked for me. We are always exchanging beauty tips of the sort. When someone approached us (we were at a bar/restaurant) and told me I was a monster for being a part of an MLM and told my friend that I wasn’t really her friend by trying to sell my scam products. I’m 8 months pregnant, very anti-mlm, and I’m prone to panic attacks especially when I feel misunderstood. I tried to get a word in but she was going on this crazy rant about “people like me”, that I should be ashamed of myself, that she could smell my oils as soon as she walked in (I don’t even wear perfume), and I realized I was never going to get to speak. I let her finish her rant and was hoping she would walk away and be done with it. I saw her say something to a staff member while pointing to our table, but never heard anything past that. My friend and I were speechless. \n\nLuckily, I was able to find humor in the situation because I follow this group and am very aware of the hate toward MLMs. We ended up laughing it off but I was quite upset because I don’t believe the way she handled that was appropriate. The blatant lying (about smelling my oils) and refusal to listen (just to find out I wasn’t selling anything) was infuriating. I’m all for educating about MLM’s and can’t stand them as much as anyone on this sub, but that was completely uncalled for.

    "body": "**If you don't want to read this story, there's a TL;DR at the end**\n\nSo I've been battling with seborrheic dermatitis since I was a little girl. Long story short, my younger brother threw some of our mother's fragrances and essential oils into my scalp (and his own). This was when I was around 8 or 9. I'm 21 now.\n\nMy mother always combated it my mixing some Nizoral (ketoconazole 1% OTC shampoo) with regular kids shampoo. If it was really bad, she'd use the Nizoral whole. She'd use regular products to style my hair (edge control, Luster's Pink Olive Oil, etc) and I'd be good to go. I could use anything on my scalp without issue. As I got older, I used the Nizoral less and less because my scalp was nice and healthy.\n\nThen by the time I hit 16/17, my seborrheic dermatitis started flaring up like hell. I'd wash it like usual and it'll flake up within two or three day of washing. At the worst points, it'll start flaking as soon as my scalp dried.\n\nI tried all the common dandruff shampoos on the market. Head and Shoulders (zinc pyrithione), T Gel (coal tar), T Sal (salicylic acid), and Nizoral. I used each one alone for several months, then tried to alternate between them. I left them on from 5-10 minutes before rinsing. I'd double wash.\n\nI switched to a SLS free shampoo (Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo). I used a clarifying shampoo (Suave Daily Clarifying). I used all of these shampoos in various combinations.\n\nI went no shampoo; I'd only \"wash\" with water. I tried different water temperatures. I tried filtered, distilled, spring water. Then, I went to using ACV (apple cider vinegar) as shampoo. I tried ACV and baking soda. During senior year of high school, I went to my graduation rehearsal smelling like ketchup because I'd washed my hair with ACV that morning. \n\nI tried washing my hair every day. It would keep the flakes at bay, but it was a tedious process to wash my hair every day and wait for it to dry. It also stripped the hell outta my hair. It wasn't practical. Sometimes I'd have to go to sleep with wet hair. Then, I switched to only washing in the morning.\n\nI tried hot oil treatments: olive oil, coconut oil, mineral oil,  and castor oil either by themselves or in various mixes. I tried to leave in the hot oil treatments, I tried them before washing, I tried them after washing.\n\nI scrubbed my scalp with tea tree oil. I tried various \"dandruff\" shampoos and conditioners. \n\nThen, I finally went to to the dermatologist this year. I was prescribed 2% Ketoconazole shampoo and 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide oil. I used them as prescribed (leave the shampoo on for 5 minutes, wash every 3 days, use the oil after washing). My dandruff got better. I thought it was fixed after I finished the bottle. I switched back to the otc ketoconazole shampoo, and the dandruff returned. I was damned. \n\n*Cue MCT oil*\n\nMCT oil (Medium-chain triglyceride) is derived from coconut oil. *Wait a minute*, you're probably thinking. *Isn't coconut oil bad for dandruff? Won't it only feed the yeast?* Not MCT oil! Sciency science has shown that malassezia  yeast (what causes seborrheic dermatitis) can't metabolize the fatty acids in medium-chain triglycerides. [Basically, we're in the clear to use MCT oil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10507598)\n\nSo, after washing my hair with the Nizoral, I apply MCT oil to my entire scalp. I hadn't washed my hair in about two weeks, and I noticed only minimal flaking. As in, I only noticed one flake large enough to pick off, and then a few sparse flakes if I scratched hard enough.\n\n**td;lr**\n\n**MCT oil has fixed my dandruff.**\n\n**I tried a lot of methods to fix this issue. Now, I just wash my hair with Nizoral and oil my scalp with MCT oil afterwards. I'm good to go.**",

        "body": "THANK YOU FOR THIS! I've been suffering from SD for the past 4-5 years, went for a Brazilian keratin treatment and the hairdresser applied it onto my scalp :-|\nIt tingled, but I have high pain tolerance, so I wasn't too bothered.\nThat was until I started becoming allergic to shampoo, and my scalp had acne on it, small to medium sized burning bumps.\n\nLike you, I've also tried 'organic all-natural' shampoos (Moroccan Method, Himalaya, Dermaveen, Dr.Bronner's baby, Burt's bees baby shampoo, Aubrey Organics, god knows what else. FYI I was aware that I'm allergic to fragrance, so most of the stuff I tried were fragrance free and I also tried to avoid essential oils), ACV rinse, JUST WATER, Free & Clear shampoo, coconut oil scalp masks, black soap, and when one day my scalp was actually warm to the touch and burning on the inside, I finally went to the dermatologist. She prescribed me Polytar, which didn't really work for the dandruff, but it calmed my scalp. Did a patch test which shows that I'm allergic to formaldehyde!!! I did read that the Brazilian keratin treatment had formaldehyde in it. (I was also prescribed a scalp lotion called Elosone, which was nice but too lazy to put it on, and a shitload of strong antihistamines which made me very very depressed, so I stopped taking it)\n\nPolytar stopped production about a year I was into it, and I've tried pine tar and other types of coal tar shampoos since. I've been on the routine of alternating between [DHS zinc shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/DHS-300960729165-Zinc-Shampoo-16oz/dp/B0046JOT4O?th=1) and [MG 217 shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/MG217-Psoriasis-Medicated-Conditioning-Formula/dp/B009ZBMVHU) a couple of years ago, this reduced my dandruff about 70%. I only feel the bumps 10% of the time now and it's *nowhere* near as painful as it was. \n\nThat said, I've also been taking [turmeric pills](http://www.vitahealth.com.my/product/proddetail.aspx?act=PI&PID=86) which helps A LOT. I'm usually very sceptical, but my doctor-surgeon parents prescribed it to my sister who has RA, and tried to cook more turmeric-based meals due to the anti-inflammatory property, so I thought I had nothing to lose anyway. WHOO HEY side effects: skin cleared up, no more scalp burning and acne, and 95% dandruff gone (the dandruff is back because I switched to a lower dosage turmeric pill -____-)\n\nCan't wait to get my hands on MCT oil! Coconut oil doesn't even penetrate into my hair and skin so I had a bad impression on it. *continues thanking profusely*\n\nEdit: Fixed abbreviation",

Dosage is 1,000 IU's per 25lbs of bodyweight. Vitamin D can reduce the over proliferation and turnover of skin cells. Sulfur and selenium are very effective topically as well as internally. Thyroid glandular supplementation or T3 if TSH is over 3. So many things can be done to win the battle of Seb derm. and psoriasis. Having adequate water and lower inflammatory foods is always the best prevention, of course. The nuke that I've found is topical DMSO(50-90%) if it's malassezia overgrowth.

I would also recommend a basic moisturizer (Cetaphil or Cerave are both good options). You’ll also want to utilize sunscreen on a daily basis.

She is always itching her scalp and just chalked it up to normalcy or perhaps dead skin, and she’s constantly busy helping other people in the house and doesn’t have much time to take care of herself. As a white person I recognized the bugs when they started appearing on the sheets, but didn’t want to alarm her… I checked today and they are deeply embedded in the loc shaft itself, and everywhere online says this isn’t possible and that they usually stay on the scalp. I even found full bodies INSIDE her locs. She hasn’t had a retwist since last November. I think she’s been suffering for a long time… :( So far we used tea tree oil and olive oil which helped to kill off the live ones, and she’s been showering with very hot water. But how am I meant to get rid of all these eggs when they are so deep inside? I figured asking this community would be the best case… also we do not have the funds to go to a loctician, so please reccomend at home remedies. Thank you everyone, and please be kind.",

Take those and wash them and dry them in an especially hot Setting because lice can’t survive that and if you can’t do that with certain items, keep them away and contained not exposing it to you or her body. (Make sure you do this step as well in case you might have them, it can be really disheartening when you go through this effort, so try to be overly thorough)\n\n2. Get a lice shampoo (probably multiple bottles for the amount of hair) and it will be easier because you can help her get in her locs. The process for me alone was hard but you should focus on the scalp and build some lather, take all that lathered shampoo and try smush it into the locs all the way to the ends. Don’t do it half cocked again when they come back it easy to lose hope. After doing this, rinse really well with just water it doesn’t need to be extra hot, warm is fine. Make sure not to use conditioner after as it interferes with the process. Her hair will be dry after (good thing tho is that itchiness does decrease after just this step doesn’t go away instantly but you will notice less itching). Repeat this process every 3 days until you feel like there completely gone, for me it took 2 weeks.\n\n3. Identify the cause of the lice (ideally you would do this step first but it leads to complacency in the first step and tunnel visioning on certain items). make sure you avoid the cause of the lice and I would recommend using a bonnet when sleeping to help avoid them coming back.\n\nI sincerely hope she can get rid of the lice, I remember how insecure I would feel having them. I hope you guys can get rid of them together and have them never come back. Good Luck 🤞",

What Im seeing doesnt look like lice but rather club hairs (shed hairs that have skin from the hair follice on one end) that can sometimes look white and can be all along the loc shaft. If the hair and scalp isnt properly moisturized the scalp can itch alot and these club hairs can be very visible. Club hair can be very visible even if you do everything right though because its just shed hair.\n\nThe way to tell the difference between lice vs club hairs is to look using a magnifying glass. Club hairs are different then lice. Google for the difference\n\nIf it is in fact lice your partner could try lice treatments and you could use lots of extra product to supersaturate the loc. You need much more product when treating locs. And the locs may have to be treated several times.

I've never had lice, so I haven't done it myself, but it's worked for my friend and her kids, both locked and unlocked. \n\n***Tools needed: lice shampoo, coconut oil, neem oil, tea tree oil, multiple plastic bags with no holes because it must be air-tight, apple Cider Vinegar, a loc Brush***\n\n*note: change bed sheets every day and wash in super hot water.*\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. Use a lice shampoo of your choice. Lather rinse repeat. \n\n2. Mix 1 cup coconut with 2 tablespoons neem oil and several drops of tea tree oil. Apply all over scalp and edges and backs of ears and nape of neck. \n\n3. Tie bag tight so no air can enter. \n\n4. Sleep overnight. Can go to work or whatever the next day if necessary, keep bag on as is and then wrap up with a decorative scarf. Most places will give you a couple of sick days to avoid spreading the plague to other employees, though\n\n5. The next evening, wash hair well with a normal shampoo and then the lice shampoo. \n\n6. Apply more of the oil mixture onto the scalp. \n\n7. This time, drench locs in Apple Cider Vinegar.\n\n8. Tie bag and allow to soak overnight. \n\n9. The next day, rinse well and then wash with lice shampoo. Allow to dry totally. \n\n10. Go outside and go upside down and shake hair out vigorously. The vinegar undoes their sticky residue, so you should be able to brush off the nits and bugs. \n\n11. Row by row, loc by loc, still outside or in a place that has no fabric or covered in drop cloths for easy cleanup, use loc brush.  This will help loosen the rest.\n\n12. The next day, you want to repeat the steps. My friend repeats this for 2 weeks. It's about 4 cycles.",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure.

    "body": "Hey everyone, \n\nI wanted to post about my experience on Tretinoin Gel 0.01% to hopefully help out some other skincare newbies like me! I've been a lurker on SCA for about 7 months and this is my first real post! Skip to the bottom for my routine.\n\n**Tips/Tricks for Tretinoin Use**\n\n1. Start with a low concentration - when I first started I was given 0.01% tretinoin gel. I asked for the gel because I know the cream has some comedogenic ingredients and my skin is very prone to clogging. First I was really worried because my dose was so low. This stuff is potent. Even at the lowest concentration (0.01%) my skin has improved a lot. Also, I didn't experience too much dryness or irritation and I was able to use the tretinoin every night.\n\n2. Start slow. The first week I used tretinoin every 2nd day and my skin reacted fine. The next week I went up to using it every night, as my doctor reacted. That being said, I take about one night off a week and my skin seems to like the break. Taking more than 1 night off a week doesn't seem to help for me. YMMV.\n\n3. Vaseline is your BEST FRIEND. It feels gross the first few times you slather your face in Vaseline at night but it is so worth it for how plump and soft your face feels the next morning. In order to help swelling of pimples during my purging, I mixed a TINY bit of tea tree oil into my vaseline. \n\n4. Try to find a routine that doesn't break you out BEFORE starting tretinoin. Once you start purging, it can be really tough to differentiate purging from a break out, so it's really helpful to be sure that your products aren't breaking you out. I switched rosehip oil brands during my purging state and the newer rosehip oil contained tocopheryl acetate which broke me out like crazy. It took almost a week for me to realize that it was the product breaking me out and not just purging.\n\n5. DO NOT PICK ON TRETINOIN. Seriously. I always found that pimples take much longer to go away if you don't extract them. Extraction seems to speed up the healing process. However this is NOT true on Tretinoin. Your skin is very fragile and pimples take much longer to disappear if you pick than if you just leave them. You also end up making a much bigger mess by picking because of how easily your skin will break.\n\n6. Your acne is severe enough. For years I never went to a doctor for my acne because I thought my acne was too mild. Thanks to SCA I asked my GP for Tretinoin. I really wish I had done this sooner.\n\n7. Purging is short (a few weeks to a few months). The better skin you will have at the end will last MUCH longer. It's worth it to push through the purge. :)\n\n**My Experience/Routine**\n\nMy skin type: Normal-Dry, Dehydrated, Clogs easily, Mild Acne\n\nWhen I first started tretinoin I looked everywhere for a timeline of how long it took it work. I'll post my timeline here to help everyone out. YMMV.\n\nWeek 1: My skin looked amazing. Pimples cleared up. I got super excited and thought maybe I would be lucky enough to skip purging. LOL.\n\nWeek 2: Started to see some mild purging. Closed comedones that were deep under the surface started to look larger as they came up to the surface. Skin was slightly red and sensitive.\n\nWeek 3: Purging got worse, especially on my cheeks (where I normally have the most pimples). More closed comedones surfaced. I was getting lots of dry skin coming off during OCM. Thankfully Vaseline prevented flaking skin. I was able to use makeup throughout the whole purge stage. A silicone-based moisturizer/primer helped makeup go on smoothly. It also got ridiculously cold where I live (-42 Celsius in Canada). The combination of purging and the extreme cold caused my skin to get a bit dry and red. Nothing too bad though.\n\nWeek 4: This is when the tocopherol acetate incident occured. Lots of new breakouts from this ingredient so hard to tell how severe my purging actually was.\n\nWeek 5: Started to see huge improvement! My cheeks cleared up a lot. I also noticed lots of improvements in skin texture (soft and smooth). \n\nWeek 6: Continuing to see improvement. I don't have any active pimples, my cheeks, nose and forehead look great. Deep closed comedones on my chin are just about to surface so I expect another small round of purging just on my chin.\n\n**My Routine**\n\nAM\n\n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Foaming Cleanser\n\n* Benton Snail Bee Essence\n\n* PureHeals Propolis Ampoule\n\n* The Face Shop Chia Seed Moisture Holding Cream\n\n* BB Cream and Makeup\n\nPM\n\n* OCM with pure mineral oil (In Canada at Loblaws you can buy Teddy's choice unscented mineral oil)\n\n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Foaming Cleanser\n\n* Wait 30 mins\n\n* Tretinoin 0.01% Gel\n\n* Wait 30 mins - 1 hr\n\n* Benton Snail Bee Essence\n\n* PureHeals Propolis Ampoule\n\n* The Face Shop Chia Seed Moisture Holding Cream\n\n* Vaseline (sometimes mixed with a tiny bit of TTO)",

I just randomly started reading the directions for my Tazorac cream the other day and it said to moisturize BEFORE putting on the cream.

My doctor gave me similar instructions to yours: every other night for 2 weeks, then switch to every night. I followed the instructions and had super flaky, red, hypersensitive skin for a while. I eventually scaled it back to about twice a week for a few months, then every other night once my moisture barrier had healed from that and other damage. The Tretinoin was still effective for me over time with scaled-back usage. Just thought I'd throw it out there for other sensitive skinned folks.",

I went to the one with the best reviews, walked in and asked for a downsize. \nStrike one: He told me it was a keloid\nStrike two: He told me to use tea tree oil to treat it as he’s “heard it can help” \nStrike 3: He had no titanium labrets to change it to it \n\nAs if all of this wasn’t enough, I knew I wasn’t going to stay after he told me he didn’t have titanium but I continued to sit there to be nice... I asked him to at least tell me what size jewelry I should order and he couldn’t tell me what gauge I had or the length I should change it to. \nHe went on to tell me that the health inspector was just there today and his sterilizing equipment wasn’t in code YIKES!!! \nTHEN he went on to complain that sterilizing is a pain in the butt. Um what?!!! \n\nFinally, now this is the kicker.. he pulled out an earring from the ones he pierces with... also not in separate packages so not sterile at all!... and he proceeded to tell me that it was probably titanium and someone he previously pierced left it there so he sterilized it and WAS GOING TO TRY TO GIVE IT TO ME!!\n\nDONT BE AFRAID TO LEAVE IF YOU DON’T THINK IT’LL BE BENEFICIAL OR SANITARY!!!",

    "body": "I am a hairstylist. I have been for almost four years now. I've seen my share of messed up cuts, over-processed colors, and totally fucked eyebrow waxes. There's not much that surprises me when it comes to hair, or so I thought so until last week.  \nMy day started like any other day. It was a rainy Saturday morning. My salon opens at 9, and I had my weekend regulars waiting for me when I opened up. I did two men's cuts and a bang trim for a lady. At about 10:30, I was able to run back to the break room and grab a cup of coffee before my rush hit.  \nAs I was waiting for the Keurig to finish brewing my cup, I heard the door open followed by footsteps. I came out to the main area to greet the customer who came in. It was an older woman and a boy about ten or eleven.  \nThey must have been walking because they looked soaked to the bone. As I approached them, I noticed their clothes were dirty and ragged. The boy's shoes were worn. I could see a hole starting at the toe of his shoe.  \n\"Hello! What can I do for you all?\" I asked as I walked to the counter to enter them in the computer system. As I approached, the unmistakable aromas of cigarettes and stale body odor filled my nostrils. I swallowed back a gag. \n\"Haircut.\" The woman replied. Her teeth rotten stumps poking out of her gums. Her face was wrinkled leather, tanned and speckled with liver spots.  \n\"For both of you?\"  \n\"Naw, just him.\"   \nThe boy had on a gray hoodie, the sleeves and arm holes stained almost black. His dirty blonde hair looked as though he hadn't washed it in a week or more. It hung in his eyes. He stared at his feet.  \n\"Awesome! What's your name, buddy?\"  \n\"His name is Lazarus.\"  \n\"What a unique name! Come on back, Lazarus. Let me get your hair washed and we will get started.\"  \n \"No. We don't need it washed,\" the woman said. The boy's hair was obviously unclean. I had to find a reason to get him back to the shampoo bowl.   \n\"It's standard procedure for hair that's past the collar,\" I quickly replied. \"We cut hair when it's wet. It's just easier.\"   \nThe woman seemed to be agitated, but didn't say anything. I took that as a signal to proceed.   \n\"Come on back, buddy!\" I said in my cheeriest voice, trying to smooth over the awkwardness. The boy got up and I led him back to the shampoo bowls.   \n\"Do you care to take your jacket off?\"  \n\"He doesn't want to take it off.\" The woman said.  \nAt this point, her answering for the boy had become beyond weird. He also hadn't looked up the entire time.  \n\"I just don't want to get his hoodie any wetter than it already is.\" \nThe woman looked at me, not saying anything. The longer she stared, the more uncomfortable I became. The boy just stood, head tilted down, eyes locked on his feet.  \n\"He's autistic. Taking his coat off makes him anxious.\"  \n\"Oh! No problem! I can work around that.\" I opened the cabinet above the shampoo station and grabbed a cape. \"Have a seat, Lazarus.\"  \nThe boy shuffled his feet over to the chair, turned around and sat down. I fastened the cape around his neck, trying to not make it obvious that I was scanning his head for lice. I'm not a judgmental person, I've just worked in the industry long enough to know what to look for.  \nThe boy leaned back and placed his neck into the groove in the bowl. I ran my hand along the nape of his neck and gently pulled the rest of his hair into the bowl. \n\"He, uh... He's got a spot. A place there in the back of his head. He had surgery.\"  \nI turned the water on and waited for It to warm up. \"What kind of surgery did you have, Lazarus?\" \n\"It was, um, a tumor. I mean-uh, a cyst,\" the woman replied, making her way back to where the boy and I were. Cysts are a pretty common occurrence, and I didn't give the comment second thought.  \n\"Is that water temperature okay, buddy?\"  \nSilence. Lazarus laid there with his eyes shut, flinching as micro droplets of water landed above his brow. I felt the water again just to make sure. It felt comfortable to me, so I proceeded with the service. I gathered his overgrown bangs and smoothed them back with the rest of his hair, running the faucet along his hairline, careful not to get water in his face. His forehead was home to a scattering of blackheads. Some red and irritated.  \n\"How often does he wash his hair?\" I asked the woman, now standing virtually right beside me.  \n\"As often as he will let me,\" she said.  \n\"I see some acne here. I think once we get those bangs off his forehead, and if he will keep his hair clean, that will help clear up the bumps.\"  \nAgain, I was greeted with silence. The woman just looked at me. At that point, I decided it was best to not speak unless I had to. I was seriously creeped out.   \nI squirted a handful of melaleuca shampoo. Melaleuca is otherwise known as tea tree oil. It smells minty and gives a cooling sensation when used. That was just what this little guy needed. I knew his greasy scalp would thank me after using it. \n\"This is going to make your head feel tingly, Lazarus.\"  \nI rubbed my hands together and began working the shampoo into a lather in Lazarus' head. He never spoke. Never opened his eyes. The occasional flinch was the only movement he made.  \nI massaged the top of his scalp, and worked my way around to his temples and sides of his head. I made my way around to the back of his head. My thumb slipped into a hair filled hole in the back of the child's head. My stomach dropped. It clicked. That was the place he woman was talking about. There was an indenting in the kid's head that was at least 1.5 inches deep just above his neckline. It felt as though it was wide enough to fit three fingers into.  \nI'm not the best at hiding emotions. My face shows everything I feel. The woman had to have seen my expression of utter shock and disgust.  \nI regained my composure. *It's only a scar,* I told myself. I began to work the lather into the hair-lined crevice. The hair inside felt more coarse than the hair covering Lazarus' head. I massaged and filled the hole with more suds. I wondered how long it had been since this part of the boy's head has been shampooed. \nAfter I was satisfied with my work, I turned the water back on and began to rinse, making my way from front to back. Something in the suds caught my eye. My instincts were right. An adult louse floated atop an unpopped soap bubble.  \n\"Ma'am, I'm afraid I don't be able to finish the service.\"  \n\"Huh?\"  \n\"I'm sorry, but I'm not going to be able to perform Lazarus haircut.\"   I looked down to finish rinsing the boy's hair. State regulations require that we go no further once evidence of an infestation has been found, but I couldn't let the child leave with soap still in his hair. I directed the stream of water into the soapy hole in the back of his head.   \nWhat I saw next is something like I've never seen before in my life. There were lice upon lice, they looked like they were flowing out of the hole in his head. I screamed and jumped back. A lifetime in the industry couldn't have prepared me for that.   \nBefore the scream escaped my throat, the woman had already grabbed the boy by the arm and jerked him to his feet. She pulled home to the door, stomping the whole way. She slung the door open and pulled the boy outside into the rain, the sole on his left foot flopping. Just like that they were gone.   \nI looked down into the sink. There were what looked to be thousands upon thousands of insects, crawling over each other and through the soap suds. There were several on my hands. I turned the water temperature lever all the way to the right. Steam billowed out of the sink. I gritted my teeth and sprayed my hands; left then right. \nI opened the cabinet and grabbed a bottle of Barbacide. I fumbled for the sink stopper, plugged the drain, and poured half the bottle into the shampoo bowl.   \n\"I'm early!\" called a voice from the door. Anne Fuller was fifteen minutes early.   \n\"Anne, I'm so sorry. I'm going to have to reschedule your appointment. I just had the worst case of head lice I have ever seen. I'm going to need the rest of the day to clean and sanitize everything.\"  \n\"LICE!\"  \nJust what I needed. Anne is a hypochondriac with a flair for the dramatic.  \n\"It's not a huge deal. I just don't want to risk anyone else picking it up. When do you want to reschedule?\"  \n\"You just give me a call when you are sure there's no more left. I'd hate to be the one to give my grandkids the damn lice! Oh, I'm itching all over!\"  \n\"You'll be fine, Anne. I'll give you a call Monday morning.\"  \n\nI spent the rest of Saturday cleaning, bleaching, washing, and sanitizing. At 4:00, I was finally satisfied with my efforts. I went to the break room, sat down at the table, and looked at over my cold coffee I had brewed earlier in the day. I placed my elbows on the table and put my head in my hands.   I opened my eyes and there were two small bugs on the table in front of me.  \nNo.  \nI shook my hair.  \nAnother fell out.  \n\n",

    "body": "Long post ahead. I've tried to jot every basic thing that I've learnt. I've a used a para or two from a post by Aayu (her dad owns reddit btw) because I thought she phrased it good. I've included about things that I personally had experience with for this to be authentic but the word is \"mostly\" tho. So I hope this helps you. If you think I've misinformed anything, comment it down below.\n\nGetting started in Skincare can be overwhelming, what ingredients do what, what all are safe, what all are soothing, in what order should they be layered, at what frequency are they supposed to be used. Basically, there are too many questions, too much stuff to learn, and too little experience. So, I’ll tell you all about the things I’ve learned during the last 10+ months and if you can avoid the mistakes I’ve done, this article would have served its purpose and can rest in peace.\n\nA little disclaimer: while I’d like to think of myself as a person that does quite decent research no matter what the subject, I’d like you to take my advice with a pinch of salt. Do your own research thoroughly before you add a product into your routine.\n\r\nSo, since this is a dummies guide I’ll try and help you make a routine for yourself. I’ll add my advice at the end, based on experience and I hope this would be your greater take away as the rest info can be found anywhere online. And by no means do I mean you guys are dummies btw.\n\r\nFirstly, let’s address why skincare? As much as we’d like our life to be a perfect bubble, we know that it isn’t the case. Skincare can help every single type of skin. Your skin breaks out? Sure, we can do something about it, you get dry patches on your skin? Sure, we can manage that too, you have no problem with skin whatsoever? We can help your skin be that way till your friends are all old and wrinkly. The idea of skincare is just to provide what it needs for it to remain in a zen state by keeping it happy.\n\r\nYour skin can just do fine with as basic a routine as Cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Rest all is needed for that extra push if you will. Skin, as fascinating and self-sufficient a thing it is, sometimes needs help to function properly.\r\nLet’s tackle this baffling thing that skincare is by focusing on one product at a time.\n\r\nI loved this paragraph that has been put together by AsainBeauty on Reddit.\n\r\n>Understanding what works for you and making informed purchases are a bit of a chicken-and-egg conundrum seeing as you won’t know your skin until you start using a routine, and you won’t know what to purchase until you know your skin! That being said, there are a lot of products out there that work for the majority of people and maybe safe initial purchases, based on your skin type and skin concerns. There may be a perfect product out there for you, but it may take some time to find it as you will have to figure out what specific ingredients your skin likes, which ones it can’t deal with, and which ones are just meh.\n\r\n##***Cleanser***\r\nWe all know that our face similar to our body needs washing too. So, whenever you’re choosing a cleanser make sure it is as gentle as it can be. It shouldn’t be over stripping no matter what. If you have a squeaky clean face after you wash your face and you feel like “ oh my face seems to be pretty clean now, in your face dirt and bacteria ha!, I won’t let you become a zit on my face today” then you’re in trouble.\r\nAs we know our skin, being an intelligent thing that it is, normally produces oil for preserving itself. But when your face is over cleaned, if that’s a word, your skin rings the emergency alarm and asks for more oil production. So now you might feel like your face is greasy all day long. If you’re a dry skin person then guess what you’re in for more trouble. So, it’s important to choose something that doesn’t strip away your natural oil. I’d advise staying away from the whole anti-acne facewash lines we have, as none of them actually benefit you. Your facewashe should have a pH between 4.5 to 7. pH of products is important for maintaining skin barrier integrity, your skin has an acid mantle (protective barrier on the surface of skin composed of sweat, skin oils, and dead skin cells) that gives it its pH value. This mantle is a thin layer on your skin that protects you from bacteria, virus, fungi making it soft and supple, disrupting this layer can cause effects like inflammation, dermatitis, dry and dehydrated skin. Pollution, pathogens, cleansers, soaps and even water might disrupt your mantle, so it’s important for your cleanser to have a low pH so that it doesn’t make your skin squeaky clean. I know I just complicated the shit out for something like a cleanser, but don’t worry you’ll find a ton of recommendations for cleansers in that pH range.\n\r\nAnd 60 seconds should be the max time you should spend washing your face.\n\r\nYour typical face cleansers are actually used as a second cleanser. There is actually an oil-based cleanser that people use to remove the dirt, make-up, pollution, sunscreen at the end of the day. You can’t actually use oil for this purpose as there’s a risk of it remaining on the skin, even after the second cleanse, and therefore clogging your pores. Oil Cleansers or micellar water or cleansing balms are the better choices for first cleansing as they have emulsifiers that breakdown the oil and therefore helping you remove dirt and makeup along with oil. You might actually be fine without incorporating the first cleanser but many people often report that it actually made a difference, helping them.\r\nYou can skip cleansers in the morning and it might actually benefit you, remember how we talked about stripping your face of Its natural oils.\n\r\nSome loved and affordable products: Cetaphil Gentle cleanser, Simple refreshing Facewash.\n\r\n##***Moisturizer***\r\nThis is just more of a trial and error sort of thing. Just choosing a moisturizer with non-comedogenic ingredients (pore-clogging ingredients) would be fine. Oily skin people can like gel textured moisturizers, dry skinned people can benefit from something thick. Typically, the thicker the product, the more moisturizing it is. If you’re oily I’d advise you to stay away from all-natural moisturizers as they usually have too many oils in them and they might clog your pores and you might end up with closed comedones (or clogged pores). There are three things in moisturizers emollients, occlusives, humectants. Emollients provide your skin with required moisturization helping your lipid barrier (your skin has lipids and ceramides and all kinds of stuff) therefore keeping it healthy, Oils, shea butter, ceramides are examples of emollients you can find. Humectants bring moisture to your skin from air thus preventing your skin from getting dry, Glycerin and hyaluronic acid are two main used Humectants. Occlusives prevent water loss from your skin, oils, silicones, dimethicone, mineral oils are examples of occlusives you can usually find in products. These three in a moisturizer can help your skin restore its skin barrier therefore keeping it healthy and happy while minimizing the possibility for irritation.\r\nThings to consider when evaluating how well your moisturizer works:\r\n•\tDoes it leave your skin feeling bouncy and supple? Happy and healthy, not dry and tight, is what a good moisturizer is aiming for.\r\n•\tHow long does that moisturized feeling last? If it only lasts an hour or two, you may want to find a different moisturizer! Perhaps try a thicker moisturizer, like a cream or a balm.\r\nIf your moisturizer is gentle enough, doesn’t break you out, and does what it’s supposed to do, that’s awesome! Go ahead and enjoy it as part of your skincare routine :). If it turns out that your product irritates your skin, gives you acne, or doesn’t do what it should, it might be time to try a different one!\n\r\n##***Sunscreen***\r\nIt’s the most important step period. Whatever you might be doing to your skin, if you aren’t using sunscreen it would all be a waste.\n\r\nSunscreen has the following benefits:\r\n•\tReduces the risk of skin cancer\r\n•\tPrevents hyperpigmentation\r\n•\tReduces signs of aging\r\n•\tProtects against signs of photodamage (fine lines, etc.)\r\n•\tPrevents burns (dark-skinned people aren’t affected much)\n\r\nThings to remember before buying sunscreen:\r\n1. The more the SPF the better it is.\r\n2. It should be waterproof\r\n3. It shouldn’t break you out obviously\r\n4. I’d advise you to stay away from the whole natural line again.\r\n5. If you have dark skin, avoid sunscreens with high percentages of physical filters (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) as they’ll lend a white cast to your skin. Chemical sunscreens are your best bet.\r\n6. If you have sensitive skin, you may prefer to look for an all physical sunscreen or a physical/chemical combination sunscreen — chemical filters (Oxybenzone, Avobenzone, typically organic ingredients) may cause stinging and irritation for some people.\n7. The higher the Pa+++ rating the better protection you get.\n\r\nKorean Sunscreens (from CosRx and Purito perhaps) are great, they tend to be moisturizing while providing an adequate amount of sun protection\n\r\nThis is it for people that usually have healthy skin or normal skin, from here on you can make your skin better but you’d have to be careful with giving your skin that extra push for dealing with aging, pigmentation, scarring, etc. I’m all up for it, if I can better myself in any way possible, and achieving great things always involves a tad bit of risk as you’d be treading in unfamiliar territory. You can minimalize the risk by studying more about it and all things worth having require effort now, don’t they? I’m just making it sound dramatic because I messed up and I don’t want you to mess up.\n\r\nAfter following a basic routine for a few months and building a healthy skin barrier, you can start adding actives to your routine that benefit you and up your skincare game a notch. But do not enter the actives zone unless you’ve found a good Cleanser, moisturizer, and Sunscreen routine. After nailing your basic routine wait a month or two before introducing a new product and introduce a single product at a time. Be patient skincare takes time to show any results.\n\r\n##*Let’s talk actives now.*\n\r\n***AHAs:*** Alpha hydroxy acids or it is called, are exfoliating agents that work on surface-level helping you clear out tiny bumps on your skin (CCs). AHAs brighten your skin too helping with hyperpigmentation as they work on the surface level. Even though using acids on your skin sounds terrifying, don’t worry much they are well-researched ingredients and do wonders to your skin. Glycolic acid, Lactic acid (Milder), Mandelic acid (Milder) are commonly found ingredients.\n\r\n***BHAs:*** BHAs are oil-soluble ingredients so they work at the pore level. The soak up the oil clogging the pore that was about to become a pimple. These help people with acne a lot. Salicylic acid, betaine salicylate (Milder) are commonly found ingredients.\n\r\n***PHAs:*** PHAs are really mild ingredients and can be very well treated by people with sensitive skin.\r\nAll these ingredients are exfoliating ingredients that are naturally derived (from almonds, sugarcane, beets, etc;) and can be found in various formulations and products like toners, essence, moisturizers, sometimes cleansers (but these make very less difference as they don’t sit on your face longer). Start with the smallest percentage you can find and start introducing it once a week. No matter what the product says, don’t start anything with the recommended usage. Start bringing it into your routine by using it once a week for a month or so and then increase it to twice a week. You can really irritate your skin if you aren’t careful enough. Be patient, they’ll help you.\n\r\n***Over exfoliation:*** This is a thing and if you happen to do this, that is exfoliate more than you are supposed to, your skin is going to freak the F out. You’ll damage your skin barrier, deal with more breakouts, your skin will remain red for long periods of time so don’t overuse a product that you have never used before. (I’ve had to deal with this btw)\n\r\n***Niacinamide:*** This is an active form of vitamin B3 that helps with pigmentation, sebum production and therefore reducing the size of your pores. This ingredient is really well tolerated by everyone and often is referred to as a holy grail ingredient.\n\r\nNow the I haven’t had experience with ingredients like vitamin C, Retinoids, Azelaic acid, and others yet and so I can’t speak from personal experience but research them thoroughly if you’d want t get into them. They can make your situation worse if you don’t use them carefully. Since I’m a dummy too I’d want to stay away from them for now.\n\r\n***Purging:*** Also learn about purging. Whenever you’re introducing any actives your skin becomes worse before it gets better (worse as in you’ll deal with more than you usually do, so it changes from person to person). Purging is only possible if you are using products with active exfoliants, such as AHAs, BHAs, scrubs, peels, or retinoids. Why? Because exfoliation causes your skin to push the blockages inside of it out to the surface. Therefore, you can’t really “purge” from using a new moisturizer or new sunscreen. If you feel like you are “purging” after using a new moisturizer (or new product without any actives), you are probably just breaking out from the product. This usually lasts for a few weeks. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UD2eRiflNI) to know more.\r\n\r\nAlso, here’s a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/expanding_your_routine) on adding products I found recently that might help you.\n\r\n##***Skin Concerns***\r\nFirst knowing what skin type you have, helps a lot. Go through this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vic-EMOivpA) and then you can understand what might help your skin.\r\n\r\nLet’s get through skin concerns now and let’s begin with the most common issue “Acne”.\n\r\nOily skin people usually have to deal with acne compared to dry skin people. The frustrating thing about acne is there isn’t a single thing you can point out to be the potential cause. There are literally a ton of factors that can trigger acne. So, first, let’s understand why you breakout.\r\nOur skin is made up of pores right and these pores usually have hair follicles, and there are sebaceous glands in these pores that produce oil to nourish your skin and the follicle. But we being humans we shed skin cells quite often and this is called skin cell turnover (about 50% of the dust around you comprises of dead skin cells). Sometimes when too much oil is produced or too many dead skin cells are shed our pores usually make a cocktail of oil and dead skin cells blocking our pores and these are clogged pores. There’s this bacteria called p.acne that enters this cocktail sometimes to party, and when our body detects this invasion it sends white blood cells to fight them off and it becomes this pus-filled pimple. Lack of sleep, stress, hormones, food, etc. can also trigger acne from inside messing up the oil production and skin cell turnover.\n\r\n###***Regulating Sebum Production:***\r\n1. Look out for ingredients like Niacinamide, green tea.\r\n2. Moisturize your skin so your skin doesn’t have to.\r\n3. Use a cleanser that isn’t over stripping.\r\n4. Include facial oils to lock in the moisture, it really can be a game-changer. Look out for oils with high linoleic acid like Rosehip oil or squalene as they are light on the skin. (oils high in oleic acid can help dry skin by providing sufficient nourishment as they tend to be rich).\n\r\n###***Managing dead skin:***\r\n***Exfoliants:*** Exfoliation is the way to help our skin with managing its skin cell turnover. You might be familiar with scrubs we usually find in the market. Scrubs are labeled under physical exfoliation. Even though people have been using physical exfoliation for a long time, it is actually proven to be not skin-friendly. The grains in scrubs usually cause micro-tears in your skin and might aggravate aging. Also, avoid scrubs if you have breakouts on your face, or maybe just avoid the region you have the breakout. If it’s cut open it might lead to further inflammation, pigmentation and makes you more susceptible to have another breakout. If you are choosing physical exfoliation make sure the grains are as tiny as possible. I actually find chemical exfoliators beneficial and safe. About which I’ve added in the Actives section.\r\n***Pigmentation:***\r\nThere’ two types of Pigmentation. One is PIE the other is PIH. PIE is the red spot you usually have after the pimple situation. It is usually red as vessels below the skin are damaged. If you further irritate your skin or expose it to sunlight your skin triggers melanocytes to produce more melanin to save keratinocytes, therefore resulting in PIH. This is the dark spot that you see after the pimple situation.\r\nPigmentation takes months to heal so your best bet is to prevent it from happening. So, what can you do to prevent it? Firstly, stop picking at your pimples. It just irritates your skin and more irritation equals more damage which equals more recovery time. Don’t go under sunlight if you don’t have sunscreen on. It is generally advised to wear sunscreen even though you are indoors. If you don’t wear sunscreen with enough SPF, there’s no point in doing any sort of treatment for those spots. It would all just be a moo point. So, wear sunscreen kids.\n\r\nFor reduction of pigmentation, you can add niacinamide, AHAs, Vitamin C, azelaic acid to your routine. But sunscreen first.\n\r\n###***Dry skinned beauties:*** \nDry skinned people are usually more susceptible to aging so, it’s really important to hydrate and moisturize your skin. You can add ingredients like Hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and choose moisturizers that are usually thick in consistency. Also, add toners and essences for hydration. You can also lookup slugging online. Follow Charlotte Palermino on Instagram for advice.\n\r\n#***Advice from experience***\r\nI had to learn these things the hard way as I f’d up way too much and I literally gambled with my skin, which I strongly advise you against btw. I was just an idiot honestly, hope you take away these things.\n\r\n1. Asian beauty over everything: This is just a personal preference actually as they usually tend to be really really mild and beginner-friendly.\n\r\n2. Keep your skin happy. Do not irritate it no matter what. If you find that something is irritating your skin dump it no matter how much you’ve paid for it or just use it on your body. Also, keep your routine really simple. The more products you add the more you are susceptible to irritation and the less you’ll know what might have caused it.\n\r\n3. Don’t underestimate the damage products can do. Introduce any sort of product with caution, always stay on the back foot. Introduce anything in small amounts. You don’t need a ton of ingredients and products to have healthy skin, keep it simple, and only introduce products according to needs.\n\r\n4. Always always always start with the least potent product you can find, to help your skin get used to it.\n\r\n5. No essential oils. Essential oils do more bad than good usually. They might trigger serious irritation, speed up aging. No tea tree oil topical application and all, trust me on this. There were way better ingredients out there that you can experiment with.\n\r\n6. No fragrance can be the way to go if you can find it. Usually, companies don’t disclose the ingredients they’ve used for fragrance and so some ingredient present in there might trigger irritation.\n\r\n7. If you find a red spot you see before the pimple pops up, it usually means something irritated your skin and now it is Inflamed. Spot treating it with pure aloe vera gel helps a ton. You can try wow 99% aloe gel (the only product I trust enough from wow btw).\n\r\n8. STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE.\n\r\n9. Pimple popping isn’t worth the shit you have to deal with later at all.\n\r\n10. Give your product some time. Sometimes it might not be the product that irritated your skin so don’t jump on that trigger quick.\n\r\n11. No product is going to change your skin overnight, there is no miracle product out there. So, stop being impatient and using it more than you can handle. There is nothing called overnight transformation. No face mask will resolve all your issues. Rome was not built in a day. Skincare is an everyday habit, consistency is a must. Sometimes breakouts/purging can cause you a lot of anxiety. This can make you go overboard and cause more harm than good. Please be patient with your skin and trust the process.\n\r\n12. Don’t be too harsh on yourself, dealing with acne can be hard and takes a toll on our mental health. Just remember it doesn’t define you and you can do something about it.\n\r\n13. With great power comes great responsibility. The ingredients you find people mentioning online that made a difference for them can be really good but if you don’t use them carefully, you might have to deal with more.\n\r\n14. Skincare is a marathon, not a race. Remember that the efforts you’re putting in will benefit you in long term.\n\r\n15. Start reading the ingredients list, you’ll eventually know why there is a specific ingredient in there with time. Use https://incidecoder.com/ to read the ingredient label before purchasing a product.\n\r\n16. Only move to the next product if you’re sure that the current one you’re using doesn’t irritate you.\n\r\n17. Listen to your skin, not to reviews not to YouTubers. Monitor & observe your skin closely. If some advice is producing negative results even after consistent efforts, no matter how many people claim the advice is working for them, drop it, and vice versa. Learn to observe what causes your skin to react positively/negatively. People are paid to make reviews online if you have a channel on YouTube or they sed products free of cost for them to review (barter) so don’t take reviews too seriously unless you trust the source. (primarily wow and mama earth).\n\r\n18. NO DIY. Some natural things that are safe to put on your face are honey, aloe vera, tomato masks now and then for brightening(it has lactic acid in it), and you can spot treat pimples with a mixture of turmeric and milk. Don’t overdo any of these either.\n\r\n19. Sleep early ( I can’t seem to do this but it literally changes your skin game), stay hydrated, change pillow covers often, wash your towels, so basically make sure everything that comes into contact with your skin is clean.\n\r\n20. We are all different. Our skin is not the same. Our environment is not the same. Our genes are not the same. What may be too much for me maybe too little for you and, vice-versa. Please patch-test before you try any new product.\n\r\n21. Skincare YouTubers and Instagrammers: Beauty Within, Liah Yoo, James Welsh, Cassandra Bankson, Hyram, Lab muffin, Samapti Banerjee, Charlotte Palermino, Gothamista, these are some people that I follow.\n\r\nEnjoy the process, enjoy taking time for yourself. Happy skincare people.\n\r\nCredits: Reddit: r/skincareaddicts, r/Asianbeauty, r/indianskincareaddicts.\n\nEdit: Adding a previous post of mine\n\nSkincare is a journey, so here's some things that help improve your skin quite a bit.\n\n**1. Sleep:**  Sleep is such an affecting factor when I look back. When I was in college I used to sleep at around 4-5 am (just being a normal millennial I guess) and my skin was bad most of the time, there were several other factors that contributed to it too but sleep was definitely one. I realised this recently when I had been in a motorcycle accident and had to have surgery. After the surgery I used to sleep at around 12-1 am and during the initial stages of my recovery and my skin rarely if ever broke out. So yeah even though it's hard to put your phone down missing out on watching those food videos and all just remind yourself you need to have better at any cost.\n\n**2. Pillow covers and Bed sheets:** If you've ever heard any Youtuber talk about this trust them it's true. When I had the accident I told you about I broke my collarbone, So I couldn't turn around when I'm asleep so my face was never in contact with the bed during the night and as a result my face was clear. I was able to pin this down when I started recovering. I  could sleep on my right side (collarbone is broken on the left side) after a while and in a few days my face started to break out on my right side. It was weird kind of, no spot on my left side but a few pimples on my right. So yes Bed sheets and pillow covers do matter. I don't use a pillow but I don't change the bedsheet regularly being the lazy 21 yr old I am, So I try sleeping on my back most of the time. But this isn't effective all the time, so sheets do matter.\n\n**3. Water:** Come on now what problem do you have with drinking water, just drink plenty of water everyday and stay hydrated. You have literally nothing to lose and everything to gain so just drink your damn water.\n\n**4. Digestion and Bowel movement:** Include more fibre into your diet for better digestion. Have a big glass of warm  water after you wake up empty stomach, it really helps. A healthy gut results in healthy skin.\n\n**5. Diet:** Stay away from sugar, unhealthy fats, Dairy products. Include healthy fats that are rich in omega 3 like walnuts, egg yolks, flax and chia seeds, and sea food if you're a non vegetarian. My skin quality was always poor , I get strech marks even with the slightest change in my body, so I started adding omega 3 religiously although I don't know if it's made any difference.\n\n( Maintain moderation in diet and you'll be fine)\n\n**6. Don't touch your face:** It's so hard not to do this but this might be a game changer. No matter how much you want to touch the pimple that's gonna pop out in a day or two refrain from doing it. If you have to touch because it's itching or for some other reason wash your hands properly before hand. I've become too conscious of this recently, I use my right index finger for whenever I need to touch my face. So I avoid touching anything with this finger and it kind of seperates itself on it's own whenever I'm using my hands. Wash your hands at all costs before touching your face.\n\n**7. Keep your hair clean:** This way you can reduce the acne around your hair line.\n\n**8. Don't irritate your skin:** Learning to listen to your skin a great skill imo. I never understand if the product is bad or it's just purging and I end up irritating my skin most of the time. I don't understand when my skin is agitated , might be because I don't observe enough, but don't over use anything and stress your skin, any product takes a bit time to show any result. Skin care is a marathon kind of thing, results won't appear instantly so embrace this journey and keep learning :-)\n**9. Your facial oil is good:** It's just produced to retain the moisture on your face. Don't strip it away to get a squeaky clean feeling after you wash your face, this'll just result in more oil production and as a result P. acne gets more feed. \n\n**10. Use a Clean Towel:** It's comes in contact with your face so there's no need to stress on how important it is for your towels to be clean. Or if you have the patience just air dry your face.\n\n>*So focus on getting your basics right because if you don't get these right no amount of skin care products can help.*",

    "body": "Many of you have asked about my process over the last few months, so I figured I’d finally write something to that effect. This is *in general* of course, every video is different.\n\nI have a running list of suggested topics and ideas, but oftentimes, I am thinking at least a video or two ahead. While working on the Healthcare video, I’d occasionally think of a story I wanted to tell in my Veterans video, so I would write it down and hope the notes make sense a week or two from now – it doesn’t always work out that way unfortunately. \n\nBy the time I’m actually ready to work on that topic, I usually have a decent idea of what the video will be about, but again, that isn’t always the case and sometimes I have to start from zero. The Armenian Genocide is a great example – that was on my list forever. After I finished the Marco Polo video, I wasn’t sure what to do next. So I consulted my list, figured it would be a good time to do that topic, and got to work. I’ll only hit a topic if I think I can bring something new, I have a different perspective from what I’ve seen, or the video I want to make just doesn’t exist yet. I’m not interested in rehashing the same topic someone else has already done – occasionally it happens, but again, I like to think I come at it from some other angle.\n\nI very rarely pick a topic that I know nothing about already. I usually have some sort of base knowledge or a skeleton to work with. I start asking myself questions, what do I personally want to know about this topic? What do I think is important to know? Take the healthcare video for example. What is the difference between an HMO and PPO? Do British people really pay more in taxes like I’ve always heard? Where is the line where not having insurance is actually cheaper? This video was somewhat unique because I had to change focus halfway through – I really was figuring out how much $3000 stitches would cost under an HMO, under a PPO, under Medicare. But every time it was a huge, often overlapping range and I realized I needed to rethink my strategy.\n\nOften, the hardest part of the research and outline process is figuring out what NOT to include. For the MLM video, I deep dove into a dozen or so MLMs, figuring out what they sell, how they profit, what their rank and bonus structure is, all of that. But I couldn’t make a video talking about a dozen different companies – and many of them are similar enough. So I made a list of each MLM and what they have that makes them unique. Herbalife recruits people mostly so they can get the discount themselves. Young Living does the same, but to a religious extreme, and it replaces all your normal products, not just your morning protein shake. Tupperware is actually legitimate and legal. Stuff like that. I threw out all the research I did on companies like Cutco/Vector, Mary Kay, Scentsy, and a few others.\n\nIn my research, I try to answer those questions and try to understand what THEY are saying – not what others are saying about them. For the MLM video, I didn’t watch people bashing MLMs (I had seen that for years at this point). I watched them. I listened to what they say to each other, how they talk about it, what the company tells its distributors. I did a similar thing for the Scientology and Sovereign Citizens videos – by the end, I could watch one of their insane ramblings or secret interviews and understand just about every codeword or business lingo they use. If I don’t, I pause it and look it up. Watching Tom Cruise, whoa he just said he lives and breathes KSW, what is that… \\*types\\* oh okay it’s the policy LRH wrote about defending Scientology at all times – “Keep Scientology Working.”\n\nThat’s generally how the process works. The closest time window I can give you is that it takes about a week of research for every ten minutes of final footage – so a 20 minute video is two weeks, a 30 minute video three, etc.\n\nEither during the research process or while I’m brainstorming the next video – while working on the current video – I will start thinking about what I want the video to physically look like. Am I using costumes? Makeup? Props? If I need to buy anything, or special order uniform name tags or something, I try to get on that as quickly as possible. There have been several occasions where I’ve had to delay filming because a prop didn’t arrive on time.\n\nI write in three phases. The initial rough draft, which can be written in one sitting if I’m really motivated, or spread across 2-3 days, where I just get the main points out there and in a decent flow. Then I comb over it again, fixing any tense issues, making sure it all flows into each other, and adding in any anecdotes or clarifications that I wanted to include but didn’t the first time. Then I usually share the script with a few people – whether they be people in my discord, other youtubers, or people I think know much more about that topic than me. For Dante, I asked an actual pastor and religious scholar to look it over. For Feminism, I had multiple LGBT creators take a look.\n\nWriting usually takes 2-3 days in total, maybe a week if it’s an exceptionally large or complicated script. Filming can be anywhere from 1-3 days depending on how many costume or location changes there are.\n\nI do all of this myself, the set is an actual room in my apartment so it’s not always set up or clean. I mean, it’s liveably clean, but it’s not “let’s film a youtube video for thousands of people” clean. I’ve gotten to the point that I have a page in my notebook with all of the measurements for where the lights and camera should be, so that I can quickly set it up and be reasonably sure it will look correct. Although I’m still working on that – during my Veterans video, the lighting was perfect when I was on Camera Right, but the shadows made my eyes look strange when I was on Camera Left. Something most of you probably didn’t notice at all. I’ve been putting more effort into the set lately, with lit up shelves behind me that I try to put relevant props on. The posters are changing to things I’ve recently referenced and are special non-reflective frames. Little things like that which don’t add to the content, but still serve as a little extra.\n\nI don’t use a teleprompter – although I do have one. The only video I used it for was Slavery’s Scar – and it was so painfully obvious that I was reading that I deleted all of the footage and started over in the style that I still use to this day. I look at my phone, read a sentence or two, look at the camera and say it, rinse and repeat. I film all of the segments where I’m sitting in the center of the frame, then all the left, then all the right. Unless there are costume, makeup, or prop changes, that messes with the order. The first thing I film is often the conclusion of the video.\n\nI can film about 1000 words an hour and my voice usually gives out around 4000-5000. Most of my scripts lately are 6000+, which means at least two days of filming. I generally know how long a video will be by the word count – I speak around 200 words a minute in my youtuber voice. So a 1500 word script would be \\~7:30, a 6500 word script would be about 32:30.\n\nA video is made three times. When you write it, when you film it, and when you edit it. I post my final scripts to Patreon, with all of the highlights and script comments that tell me where to sit, if I’m holding anything, etc. But many people have pointed out that it doesn’t always match the final product. Maybe when I’m saying it out loud, “should” sounds more correct than “could.” Or I realize I need another sentence in here because of an anecdote I forgot about until just now. The sentences about the Blood Chit being unclassified and getting rid of it off camera, for example. Or, while I’m editing, I might realize that a paragraph is really out of place, changes the tone of the video, and either needs to be moved or removed. There was a whole segment about nomenclature and what the difference between an F-16, F/A-18, and A-10 are which ended up being cut.\n\nEditing is where most of the magic happens – usually when I get to this point all of the jokes I wrote are no longer funny. But now that I can add the sound effect, or image, or music stop, it’s funny again. Editing likewise takes place in three phases. The first phase is by far the worst, longest, and most mind numbing. I have to go through the 2-3 hours of footage, put them in order, and cut together the right takes. I’ve gotten to the point where I can usually tell if a take is good while I’m saying it, so I don’t have nearly as many bloopers as I used to – I usually only say a line once or twice. But occasionally, Writer-Me thinks that a sentence like “If you were a republican” will be easy to say at Youtube speed, and he is sorely mistaken. That step takes at least a day. Listening to myself over and over, no colors, no music, trying to figure out if the take where I emphasize THIS word is better than the one where I emphasize this WORD.\n\nThe next step is a lot more fun – when I get to add the pictures, text, jokes, and effects. If the rough cut of me talking is the meat, this is the potatoes. I have a number of templates made for different text at different sizes and positions, so I don’t need to reinvent the wheel every time, but in just about every video there’s something I need to make special. Whether it’s a corner text box with three lines of text or the sizing I usually use covers my face. The third pass is the music, which is more complicated than just throwing something in an audio track. I cut the music when something funny happens, when something serious happens, or when I’m showing a clip of something else. I’ll also shift the music around if the natural tempo picks up in a place where I don’t want it to. This entire process takes 1-2 hours for every final minute of footage, the Veterans Day video took around 40 hours to edit across three days.\n\nAround this time I’ll film the ferrets playing or doing something cute for the end card, get all my patron names, write all of those in order and delete/change people who don’t want their names in there at all, and watch my video several times in order to make sure the timings and spellings are all okay. I used to be better about this, but I’d upload the video to Patreon for them to review and spot mistakes. If the mistake is something big, like a tax calculation being wrong early one, I will take the video down and fix it. If it’s something small, a misplaced apostrophe for example, I’ll usually only fix it if there’s something else as well. Rendering and uploading takes 3-4 hours, so a mistake needs to be worthwhile.\n\nAll of my videos have mistakes in them, it’s unavoidable. I can check things a hundred times, ask experts, have my patrons see it, and something will always slip through. The CW5 rank in my Veterans video is out of date. Blue Cross is a non-profit insurance company. Tea tree oil is a disinfectant – you can find better disinfectant in a gas station bathroom, but it is a disinfectant nonetheless. How severe these mistakes are changes on the viewer… most of you probably don’t think those are worth fixing. But if you are a retired Chief Warrant Officer who works at Blue Cross, you probably think I’m just the worst person on the planet.\n\nI don’t do premieres, I just release the video. Which isn’t as simple as just pressing a button. I upload the video unlisted and let it process so HD is available. If I have time to sort out any monetization issues, I try to, but that doesn’t always work. The Armenian Genocide video is permanently demonetized. The Veterans Day video was demonetized on Veterans Day, but then remonetized later. I add the end screen, which I shift around depending on what footage of the ferrets I have, I add cards referencing past videos (or cards on old videos pointing to this one), and the captions. Since I have the script and it’s mostly word for word, as I edit it along with my video, it’s pretty simple to copy paste it into Youtube’s auto-transcribe feature. I add the tags, hashtags, and all of that relevant stuff, make a thumbnail, and it’s ready.\n\nOnce the video is out, I make sure it’s posted to all my social media and start interacting with you. Whether in the comments on Youtube, twitter, reddit, or wherever, I try to stay engaged with the audience for the first day – answering questions, responding to feedback, all of that. I taper it off over the next few days, take a few days to not think about Youtube, and then I repeat the entire cycle all over again.\n\nAll of this gets more complicated if I’m working with someone on a guest segment or getting people to read quotes – or if I’m doing the same. You might have seen me pop up on some other channels in the last few weeks (check my “Appearances Elsewhere” playlist) and even filming small segments like that takes a few hours of work.\n\nI was also surprised to find out how much work a Youtuber needs to do outside of just making videos. Maintaining connections to other youtubers, keeping up with their work, responding to feedback, sponsorships, appearances, travel… reading other youtubers’ scripts, staying active in the creator community, responding to your emails (which I can only do a small fraction of), posting to twitter and Instagram, all of that is “work.” It’s how I pay the bills. So while it may seem like a fun life, and it definitely is most of the time, it’s also a busy life.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and support me through all these months. I’m ready to take a few days off and then repeat the cycle.",

    "body": "Sorry if this is long, I'm just so excited and had to share what I did. \n\n35/F hormonal acne around my chin, mouth, nose, horribly oily skin. I normally get lots of little whiteheads but at least 1-2 a month, I'll get the mother zit. The underground, even with makeup, no stopping that bitch, ruins your face for at least a week, scar for a month mother zit. \n\nWell I wake up on Monday and I can feel a little bump coming. I think bloody hell, I have a family reunion Saturday. Which means this thing is going to peak by Thursday or Friday. From that point forward I go in full effect stop the alien from attacking mode. Here's what I did: \n\nMonday: \nRoutine as normal, wash, tone, but immediately a thin layer of BP on my chin before moisturizer. I try my hardest not to touch it to see how it's progressing. Mon night, normal routine, but before bed make a mound of 10% BP on it. \n\nTuesday: \nIt's bigger. Ugh. She's growing larger. Add Stridex to my morning routine, Thin layer of BP, moisturizer and makeup like normal. Tuesday night. We're still growing. Ugh. Face mask time. Mound of Queen Helen for about 3 hours. Wash, mound of BP. \n\nWednesday:\nShe is angry now. She is big and red and if I came anywhere near her to squeeze, it will be full blown WW3. Morning Stridex, BP, makeup as normal, or as normal as I could with a monster on me. I tried desperately not to touch her but I had to keep feeling the growth throughout the day. Wednesday night... This is where the tides change and I stop myself from digging in!!! \nI immediately get home from work and wash my face. There is a very small whitehead now but still underground. DO. NOT. SQUEEZE!!!! Whatever you do, for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT SQUEEZE, do not try to pick, do not put any pressure on it period. Instead, I get a tiny pin, soak it in some alcohol and lance right into the white. I stick my tongue inside my mouth and push behind it. Some goo comes out. I wipe it with Stridex, burns but we're good. I go out about my evening. Bedtime, wash again and mound on BP. \n\nThursday: \nStill small whitehead, majorly red and swollen and painful.  DO NOT SQUEEZE! I repeat, DO NOT SQUEEZE! Back to the pin method. Right into the whitehead, tongue in my mouth pushing. Stridex but this time instead of BP I go for tea tree oil because it's starting to get crusty and dry. Not a good look. Thursday night, she is ready!!  She's a little harder or firmer now. Pin her again and a warm compress. She's ready for extraction. Now, and only now is she ready for some slight squeezing. I said a prayer and squeezed slightly. If nothing was going to happen, I would have stopped immediately, abort mission. Instead - crack! Explosion on the mirror! She's free!!!  At this point go into recovery mode. Stridex and ice to lower swelling. Once the oozing stops and it closes up after 2 hours or so calms down, wash again, warm compress, mound of BP. \n\nFriday:\nI woke up to a flattened, slightly scabbed little red girl. She was defeated. Tonight, back to normal routine and by tomorrow for the party, maybe a very small but flat scab. \n\nI have never been happier. The takeaway from this is truly, do not squeeze if it's not ready. I've never actually waited one out and dried it up enough to have it squeezable eventually. I am now going to pin poke every damn thing instead of squeezing the fuck out of my face ever again. There were 2 days of ugliness with a raised lump that I could cover with concealer slightly vs a shit ton of ugliness, crusty, red, aggressive, embarrassingness. \n\nVictory is mine.  ",

To my eyes and from my experience (Medical Esthetician & Master Esthetics Instructor), this appears to be something called \"exfoliative keratolysis\". Although annoying and frustrating, it's an ultimately relatively harmless phenomenon that occurs where the outermost or uppermost layers of the skin (stratum corneum) and the secondary layer (stratum lucidum) present on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet begin to separate from the lower layers resulting in a shedding snakeskin like manner. I usually experience this myself about once a year or so....some years it's really prominent and others less so. It's, again, unsightly, but rather harmless unless you start pulling at the skin which can potentially cause damage.",

    "body": "  \n\nAll throughout my adolescence, I struggled with acne. It consumed my face, covering my skin with angry red welts and disgusting formations of skin and pus. I saw the way peoples’ eyes lingered on it as they walked past, judging me, thinking I was dirty. The worst of it ringed my mouth and forehead, pushing the skin into painful blisters and cysts. Serious acne isn’t just incredibly mentally taxing – it’s physically painful too.\n\nNaturally, my self-confidence was shot to bits during my teenage years. Highschool was a very lonely time for me. I hadn’t learned to approach people because the few times I had tried, I was met with at best, reluctance and scepticism and at worst, ridicule and insults. Believe me, I tried every ‘remedy’ there is out there, but all the creams and the gels and the medications did nothing to soothe the acne that was ruining not just my face but my life.\n\nI made it through high school, friendless and seriously lacking in social skills but otherwise relatively unscathed. I tried to accept the way I looked, to tell myself that it would disappear soon. I hoped fervently that one day I would awaken with a face free from acne, that as I became an adult this plague of sores would leave my life. Sadly, in a way, I was right.\n\nI just finished my second year of college. For the first time since I was 12, I have somewhat of a social life, in the form of my best friend Jae-Eun. He looked through my appearance, never once commented on the way my skin looks or on how I obviously don’t take care of myself, as so many classmates in school had been kind enough to tell me, repeatedly. \n\nWe became fast friends and bonded over our hard but rewarding studies. We kept to ourselves and focused on our work, spending our free time gaming or taking walks through the city in the dead of night. It felt easy to be friends with Jae, and that made me wonder; how would it feel to get along easily with everyone, to not get judged before one word leaves your mouth? My first year of college was the happiest I’d been in a long time, but I did feel that something was missing.\n\nMy acne was still raging throughout that first year but as fall of sophomore year rolled around, it began to subside. You can imagine how ecstatic I felt as I watched the redness leech from my face, as I witnessed the cysts deflate.\n\nThe elation was, however, brief. If I had thought the acne was atrocious, what lay in its wake was even worse. My face was incredibly pitted and scarred, more than I had ever imagined. There were great craters on my face, punctures and pockmarks and potholes. The scar tissue that lined my face made it looks as if rats had chewed my face in my sleep. I’m a skinny guy, so whereas the acne had just blanketed my face, the scars and indentations it left emphasised the hollows in my cheeks. I looked old and sick and wrong and I hated every goddamn dent that the acne had left on my face.\n\nI became obsessed with the scars, convincing myself that they were the root of all my problems. I tried to cover the scars and dark spots with makeup, but it did next to nothing to hide the pitted texture of the skin. I know next to nothing about makeup though – maybe that’s why the shades I chose made me look like death warmed up. I tried everything then, creams and tea tree oil and slathering my face with coconut oil before I slept, but all that lead to was me waking greasy and depressed, with no change in the scars.\n\nA few nights ago, I told Jae, in a fit of desperation, how deeply my scars were affecting me. He looked me in the eyes for a moment, as if coming to a decision. He nodded slightly to himself and then said somewhat sheepishly, “I know what you can do.”\n\nHe told me about a kind of South Korean shaman, a baksu, a man who could fix any ailment. I respected Jae too much to show my disbelief but as he continued, telling me about how the man had cured his aunt of her foot problems and his cousin of something or other, I began to tell myself that it wouldn’t hurt to try. His rates were cheap, and he lived only a few subway stops away. At this point I was so desperate to look normal that I would have done next to anything, so I went ahead and let Jae schedule a meeting with this man who would supposedly cure me. \n\nThe meeting was relatively uneventful – his apartment was ordinary and unimpressive. I sat in a rather hard chair and told him of my issues. He listened intently, not uttering a word until he was sure I was finished. Now, I don’t know exactly what I was expecting, but what he recommended I do certainly wasn’t it: “Find one cockroach. Put on pillow before you sleep. When you wake up, skin is smooth.” He nodded once before standing up to usher me out of his home. He almost had to push me out because I was becoming more and more irate, having hoped for some brilliant home remedy and being instead told to sleep next to vermin.\n\nI was pissed the entire way home, mentally tired and angry and disappointed. I sat outside on the steps that lead to my accommodation, trying to relax, to tell myself that I was stupid to get my hopes up. Suddenly I saw a cockroach scuttle across the step below me (unfortunately not an uncommon sight in my city). I lifted a foot to crush it before reconsidering – Jae, who I trust more than anyone, had been insistent that this guy was the real deal, that he really helped people. I sighed and picked up the insect.\n\nThat was last night. Laying the still cockroach on my pillow, I felt more stupid than I ever have before, but I also felt incredibly drained, which is probably why I did it. I soon fell sound asleep.\n\nI awoke this morning, trying to block out the fact that I would probably be dealing with a roach infestation soon. Dumb, stupid, even moronic – they don’t even come close to describing how I felt. That was until I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror as I rose from my bed and elation rushed through my veins. My skin, it was clear! It had worked! I could not believe my eyes – this was the best thing to ever happen to me!\n\nI went to the mirror for a closer inspection, to revel in the newfound smoothness of my skin. Except what I saw there is an image that has been seared onto my brain, something more repulsive than I ever could have imagined.\n\nMy scars had not miraculously disappeared. Instead, each pockmark, each crater, had been filled with tiny, tiny cockroach eggs.",

I tried everything, from balls, to wiping them down with some antibacterial substances (tea tree oil).  I even froze them overnight, but eventually the smell came back.  The bacterial colonies were pretty entrenched.  So I realized I would probably have to go with prolonged heat.  But the oven was too hot.  Gee... if only there was some instrument that precisely controlled the temperature for prolonged amounts of time....\n\nSo I put newspaper in my shoes, lightly vacuum sealed them.  Do it lightly, otherwise your shoes will deform and mold that way under the heat.  And I sous vided them at like 180 for a day!  Voila!  No more smelly!",

If you live in a hot climate like I do, this gets them pretty hot, plus it dries them out, plus UV tends to kill germs.\n\nNot sure if it hits pasteurization temperature, but I wouldn't be shocked if it does since the high temperature is measured in the shade, so if it hits 100F for the high, it could be a lot hotter directly in the summer sun.",

I took trazadone for about 3 months until it got worse and I quit cold turkey. I was also taking Vitamin b12 to help mitigate this, only to find out that it was making it worse. \n\nI tried everything. Different skin care products, tea tree oil, cutting dairy, cutting alcohol, cutting sugar. Nothing was working, and it seemed like everyday a new cyst would appear on my jawline, with no end in sight. \n\nSo I got a red light therapy mask and it has changed my life. I got one off Amazon about 3 weeks ago.\n\nThe first pic is from the night before the mask, the second pic is about 3 days in, and the last pic was just taken.

    "body": "I run a festival camping event every year (obviously not this year lol!) and EVERY YEAR, without fail I manage to destroy my feet and end up limping and in pain for weeks afterwards which has made me think about the importance of knowing how to look after your feet in a survival situation.\n\nI always plan to have extra shoes and lots of socks and wellingtons for the morning on the damp field but somehow I'm always SO busy that I rush in to organise things and end up getting wet feet and not taking the time to change until its too late and its so easy to do, just a few hours in damp shoes or socks and the feet get very soft and then you start getting pain and blisters and damage and eventually infections can develop.\n\nWhen you're concentrating on survival then you will be relying on your feet (probably more than usual) so its a good idea I reckon to have a certain level of fitness and tolerance for being on your feet all day and also to have the right equipment at hand such as good quality shoes and very good socks with lots of spares if you can.\n\nYou can buy rubber shoe coverings for trainers etc too.\n\nAfter last year my husband bought me some foot powder, several pairs of excellent hiking socks that support the feet and wick away moisture and are thick enough to protect against blisters as well as some extra trainers and some hiking boots.\n\nIts a small thing but I think its important as its so easy to overlook this consideration and to be either, unprepared or to neglect yourself and push through resulting in difficulties walking a few hours later.\n\nIts only through being in the position to experience things like this that we can realise the problems that could arise so regular hiking and camping can help highlight things like this to enable you to address problems prior to a true emergency situation.\n\nIn a SHTF situation, if you have no supplies left, then here are some things that have antifungal properties which may help with foot care to prevent or treat fungal infections before they get bad.\n\n1.Tea tree oil...not available naturally in the UK but its cheap and readily available and you could buy a large store in easily.\n\n2. Garlic\n\n3.Hydrogen peroxide\n\n4.Talc to keep feet dry.\n\n5. Alder buds.\n\nAlder grows most places and the small cones/bud type things that grow on it can be mixed with hot water to make a very strong looking tea with astringent and antibacterial properties that I think might also help in a push.\n\nAdditionally sheep's wool can be bought as a medical supply or gathered wild where it falls (check for ticks and wash it of course if its wild wool). Wool can be used to cushion around and between toes and sore spots inside your socks too.\n\nGaffer tape/duct tape is also amazing for blisters as it sticks much better than a plaster (make sure you cover the blister first sith sonething so that the tape doesn't stick directly to the damaged skin!). I used to use duct tape all the time at work inside my safety boots as it really stuck well and made me able to walk despite the inevitable awful blisters from breaking in new boots.\n\nAnd regarding breaking boots in, it would be  beneficial to have all your footwear broken in already if possibly so that you didn't have to do it in an emergency.\n\nSo thats my little thought on the importance of the oft, overlooked issue of footcare! I'm sure all the military bods here will already know about this but for everyone else it might be food for thought :-)\n\nEdit. Thankyou for the kind souls who gave me an award 😍😁",

Strengthening feet is pretty effortless and, while there may be an adjustment period, it is over quickly once strength starts building. \n\nBarefooting also helped me develop observation and coordination skills to avoid hazards rather than just trusting my shoe and walking wherever.

I had no intention of buying anything.  Apparently all other invitees backed out).  They had lotion for us to try that had tea tree oil in it, and though the other guest said she was allergic to tea tree oil she tried it anyway as the consultants insisted it was super mild and wouldn't irritate her skin.  5 minutes later her hands were turning red and feeling like they were on fire.  Cue blank awkward stares from all the consultants because their perfect product was not so perfect and God knows they don't have any real technical know-how to address any problems.  One even started talking like the woman was making it up, claiming she had \"never heard of tea tree oil being an allergen before\" and other BS.  She even said she wanted to put a drop of undiluted tea tree essential oil on the poor woman's skin to see if there would be a reaction!  Like this person was her personal science experiment.  Finally I asked if they had any coconut oil because if you have a reaction to essential oils the best way to treat it is to dilute it with an oil like coconut or even olive oil in a pinch.  They had some and it made her hands feel a lot better, and she said to me, thank God you were here!  She left real quick and pissed off after that.  And I had to sit there and listen to the pitch and BS all by myself.  Ugh.  (Disclaimer: I have been to many MLM parties and many are good experiences.  I would never join an MLM company myself, of course, but in general I have had good experiences... Except this time)",

I have been struggling with FA on my back and chest since the winter months (probably from working out in long sleeve shirts and staying in my workout clothes too long). It was getting sooo bad and my usual acne toolkit (acids, retinoids, etc) was not working. \nSummer was coming and I started researching new things. It sounded like FA so I started washing with head and shoulders, then Nizoral and using jock itch cream. I saw some improvements from that but it never went away fully and with some hormonal fluctuations I had two days where it was the worst it’s ever been, which was also two days before leaving to go on a camping trip with friends.   On the day before leaving for my trip I picked up witch hazel toner and TTO, diluted 7 drops per 1 oz. I sprayed it on before bed and I’m not kidding that I went from 20+ angry little red bumps on my chest to zero inflammation/clear skin, my back was 90% better too. I can’t thank you enough! I wonder if the 2+ weeks of shampoo and cream too or if it was just the TTO? I guess time will tell. Thank you again!",

So I decided to take a nice hot shower before going on a family trip; this is one of those long maintenance showers you take because you know the car ride with a screaming child will be miserable. While in the shower, I notice that my wife has a nice tea tree shampoo in the hanging rack above the sprayer. Here's where the tifu happens; I think to myself, \"what better way to deep clean the ol' growth forest?\" I lather a big handful into my hair and then give the boys a good scrub down. It was only after the icy fist of doom gripped my satchel that I thought to read the bottle.\n\n*\"indulge in a burst of freshness with this blend infused with tea tree oil, peppermint and witch hazel. And invigorate your senses with a minty-tingle and discover hair that is shiny and healthy looking\"*\n\nI also applied it to my armpits along that same line of logic. As I'm writing this, my pits are catching on fire. Dreading putting on deodorant...\n\nTl;dr scrubbed pits n' nuts with tingly tea tree shampoo and am feelin' the burn.",

Herbal medicine has changed my life and reversed so many aspects of my chronic lyme disease and toxicity.\n\nI live in California, and it seems like many people are unaware of the fact that the California Board of Pharmacy has brought forth new proposed regulations which would prohibit compounding pharmacies from producing a long list of legal substances, several of which are herbal. This list includes glutathione, vit B12 as methylcobalamin, tea tree oil, ALA, curcurmin, NAD+, Artemisinin, and so many more. \n\nOut of state compounding pharmacies would be forbidden from selling to California as well, which makes it even more horrifying.

    "body": "This is going to be a long post detailing everything I've learned about eczema over the past few years.  I hope that it helps someone else.  I also hope that people who have similar disease modalities teach me something (so please comment!).\n\n---\nDIAGNOSIS:  I was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis at 30.  As a kid, I had dry skin issues that cleared up, but not eczema. \n\nI was diagnosed by 2 separate dermatologists.  Reasons include family history of eczema / asthma, lifelong dry skin issues, hyper-linearity in the palms, infra-orbital folds (dennie-morgan folds) beneath the eyes... These are all things that a non-eczema person may have, but taken together with recurrent dermatitis and the diagnosis is atopic.  \n\nThis means is that the root cause is believed to be genetic, and is the result of a filaggrin deficiency in the skin matrix.  The deficiency leads to a weakened skin barrier.  Really atopic dermatitis should be thought of as 'weakened skin barrier disease'.  This causes several things to happen.  1) Moisture is lost more readily.  2) Skin deforms and cracks more easily, particularly around areas where it is flexed commonly -- the joints.  3) Things outside of you, penetrate your skin more easily and trigger an immune response. \n\nWhy didn't I get eczema as a teenager or in my 20s?  As I've learned, skin is weakest as a baby / small child (hence youthful breakouts of dry skin), strongest in teenage years / early 20s, and then weakens as you get older.  So it makes sense for it to erupt in my 30s.  Sadly it may get worse with time.   \n\nI went to an allergist and did a skin prick test just to be sure, and the only things I had an allergic reaction to were dust and roaches.  I don't believe that exposure to dust or roaches drive my symptoms, although dust may exacerbate some issues.  \n\n---\nWHY DIAGNOSIS IS SO IMPORTANT -- There are many people on this sub who never state their diagnosis.  This is so ridiculous.  Frankly I think everyone posting any piece of advice should be required to label their particular flavor of eczema with a flair or 'undiagnosed' if they are not sure. \n\nHere are a few other things that can cause exzema that are NOT genetic:\n\n1) Hypo or Hyperthyroidism -- this is going to marked by a sluggish or overactive metabolism and will have a host of other symptoms.  Once you treat the underlying thyroid issue, eczema most likely to go away. \n\n2) Contact Dermatitis -- Contact with very specific substances / chemicals will cause an IMMEDIATE breakout.  Food Allergies could almost be considered a subset of contact dermatitis except with food.   \n\n3) Parasitic Dermatitis -- what it sounds like.\n\n4) Viral Dermatitis \n\nThere are numerous underlying causes of dermatitis.  Before you offer advice or take advice, you really need to understand what the underlying dermatitis is of the person you are sharing information with. \n\nIn my case, I am 90% atopic, though I may have a 10% contact dermatitis issue with dust.  It's also important not to assume that only 1 thing drives your eczema. \n\n---\nTYPES OF ATOPIC DERMATITIS:\nMost (but not all) of you probably have atopic dermatitis.  If you don't know for sure, get a real diagnosis from a dermatologist otherwise you may be wasting a lot of time chasing treatments that won't work for you. \n\nWithin the atopic dermatitis space, there are several underlying mechanisms for the disease. \n\nIn atopic people there often seems to be some kind of microbiome disruption.  Underlying causes not fully understood, but one aspect of it deals with sweating.  Normal people sweat more easily than atopic people, and their sweat is packed with certain kinds of peptides that kill bacteria. \n\nAtopic people have a delayed onset of sweating during exercise, and sweat less at rest, and their bodies don't release as many of these anti-microbial peptides. \n\nIn atopic people, one of three common disease modalities take place:\n\n1) 60% Staph aureas -- pattern:  non-specific all over body, often around arms / legs.  Often associated with fissure-ing, oozing, crusting of skin.  If your skin discharges a fluid, most likely staph driven.  \n\n2) 30% Malasezzia -- pattern: eczema particularly targeting the face or head.  Basic strategy:  topical antifungals / oral antifungals.  \n\n3) 10% -- Airborne Proteins -- pattern:  facial dermatitis or the 'inverse tee-shirt'... areas of your body not covered by clothing are exposed to environmental allergens.  Often associated with asthma.  Basic strategy is to wash face and exposed body a lot, cover with moisturizer after each washing.  Reduce exposure to known allergens (i.e. dust).    \n\nIt's worth mentioning that there are a lot of people on this sub who seem to believe that food causes their dermatitis.  I've gone to my local university library to research this among other things, and in the case of most atopic patients food allergies do not seem to play a role.  \n\nI don't want to take away from anyone that cured their dermatitis by changing their diet, but it's possible that they weren't atopic to begin with.  It's also possible that somehow eating a different diet changed the microbiome on their skin -- which may or may not work for you if that person lived in a completely different climate / environment / geographic area or has different gut flora with a different sort of prevalence of various bacteria. \n\nI'm personally skeptical of a food based solution for atopic dermatitis (but would love to hear any comments on this from known atopic people).\n\n---\nSTAPH DRIVEN ATOPIC DERMATITIS\n\nI'm going to focus on staph, because it's what I have and what I know.  At this point, most of you probably have this as well -- but a significant percentage (almost half) do not have this variant of the disease.   \n\nDisease vector as follows:  You get dry or fissured skin because of your genetically weakened skin barrier.  Staph Aureaus, naturally present on your skin, gets into these cracks and fissures.  They generate something called super-antigens -- which is basically a disproportionately large immune response.  This triggers an intense itch.  Scratching ensues.  Fissures / dry skin becomes worse.  Staph colonizes even more.  It's a terrible feedback loop. \n\nMy current thesis right now is that the key to beating staph driven eczema is removing as many avenues to your skin that the staph has as possible.\n\n---\nTREATMENT\n\nI would love to tell you that I've solved this and am living happily symptom free.  I am not.  Like most of you, I live most of the the time with a constant annoying itch all over, and occasional flare-ups that push past annoyance into genuinely problematic, but which often resolve themselves within a week or two.\n\nThis part of the post details my current strategies for staph driven eczema, it may evolve. I certainly hope to learn more from other people's experiences in the comments. \n\n---\nMOISTURIZERS -- I haven't found there to be a huge difference between different types of moisturizer.  I've tried Cetaphil, Cerave, Eucerin, Aveeno, Triderm, Gold Bond, Vaseline, Coconut Oil, Burt's Beeswax, Argan Oil, probably a couple others... All of them are effective to some extent.  Some are like 20 - 30% more effective than others, but none of these are any kind of smoking gun that will magically cure the underlying disease. \n\nA lot of research has pointed to ceramide based moisturizers as being the best solution for repairing the deficient skin barrier in atopic people.  Ceramides mimic the natural lipids found in your skin, so the idea is that your skin can use them to repair itself.  Almost all of the research has been conducted on a moisturizer called 'Epiceram' which is prescription only and is very expensive.  Cerave has the closest formula to Epiceram, which is why it's often prescribed by dermatologists. \n\nI've personally found Cerave to cause serious dryness in areas where I previously did not have dryness.  I have only my anecdotal situation to report, but I think my skin develops a dependency on Cerave and stops producing its own natural oils whenever I use it.  Dryness kept escalating to a ridiculous point, and I have basically stopped using it after a few months each time I tried it.  I also will sweat a milky white fluid out hours later if I'm exercising, which is gross, if I use Cerave. I didn't have these problems with other moisturizers.\n \nPersonally I've found Cetaphil to be the best of the above without causing dryness dependencies, and minimizing the amount of weird sweat.  \n\nOne problem though with any of the above moisturizers is that if you use your hands to scoop it out of jar, you've basically just colonized your moisturizer with Staph.  You may think it's not a big deal, but research studies have shown that after a few days as much as 20% of your moisturizer is colonized... \n\nThis means you are RUBBING STAPH into your weakened skin barrier if you are using these large tubs.  I know... I did the same thing myself for a while. \n\nSo one hard rule of moisturizers -- you must use one with a hand pump, or you must use a moisturizer that is naturally anti-bacterial. \n\nThese days I try to use virgin coconut oil, which has properties that kill Staph (and Malassezia).  \n\nOther natural oils (tea tree oil, oregano oil) also kill staph as shown by research. \n\nCurrently I use virgin coconut oil on my body and argan oil on my face.  This way at least I know I'm not rubbing staph into my skin.  \n\nI find it does not keep me as well moisturized throughout the day as cetaphil, so I may switch back to cetaphil with a hand pump at some point.\n\n---\nOTHER PREVENTION\n\n3 MINUTE RULE:  As many of you know, after showering it's important to get moisturizing coverage within 3 minutes to keep water on your skin and get optimal clinical results.  Difficult to do with a hand pump, so also why I'm using coconut oil at the moment. \n\nSHOWER FILTER:  This is cheap ($30), very easy to install, and supposedly has shown improved clinical results in some people.  Your water may expose you to some proteins that penetrate your skin and cause eczema.  A shower filter can eliminate this. \n\nFREQUENCY OF SHOWERING: Jury is out on whether to shower as little as possible, or shower a lot and moisturize (to lock in moisture).  Studies have shown little difference in practice.  Find what works for you. \n\nHYPOALLERGENIC LAUNDRY DETERGENT:  duh.  And don't use any kind of fabric softeners, not even the sheets, which have other chemicals.  Stick to cotton and avoid synthetic fabrics, or ones washed in chemicals (non-iron shirts). \n\nTOWELS, SHEETS, BEDCLOTHES:  Must be washed at least once / week.  If you remove staph from your body, but go to bed in staph infected clothes and bedsheets, you are just reinfecting yourself.  I too viewed this as optional at one point, and am beginning to get in a routine where I wash these more regularly. \n  \nSALT WATER:  One day when I was kayaking, I noticed that my arms had completely cleared up.  It was the strangest thing, because my legs were still flared up with eczema.  I've since learned that salt water somehow also kills staph. \n\nI happen to live very close to the ocean, so it's possible for me to take a dip at the beach without too much inconvenience.  I try to go at least once per week, often more. \n\nI have also bought sea salts for bathing, and have now started to take salt water baths.\n\nWhen I initially go in the water, it's ok, but after a few minutes, it's as if someone has poured gasoline on all my eczema spots.  It burns.  Once I get out, wash the salt out, and towel off, it's like something else. \n\nI am completely symptom free for like 12 hours or more.  I've noticed huge red spots completely disappear after jumping in the salt water.\n\nI have come across a few controlled studies that found salt water reduced eczema in mice.  What I think is happening here is that the salt water is able to penetrate much deeper layers of skin than your normal anti-bacterial ointments such as coconut oil.  Being fully immersed in salt water for say 20 minutes, really starts to kill the staph. \n\nI've only been doing regular salt water baths for a few weeks, but I've noticed a difference in my flare ups, and plan to continue doing them until I see any adverse effects.  \n\nFREQUENCY: Since your environment always has staph, it's important to remember, that the staph is always attempting to recolonize your body.  So you can't just do something like wash your sheets once and call it a day.  You also can't take a salt water bath, but then hop into your old staph covered bed clothes.  You have to keep up the fight by engaging in your routine with a regular frequency, and hitting all your disease vectors on the same night. \n\nSo if you take a salt water bath on a tuesday, you have got to wash your sheets / bath towels on the same day.  \n\nIt is my hope that after a few more months of salt water, followed with washing linens, bedtime clothes, and using coconut oil as my go to moisturizer, I may have my eczema under tighter control. \n\nOther treatments:  There are a lot of other treatments that people on this sub have tried.  I've never tried stuff like UV light theraphy, or probiotic creams... so can't comment on that.  One thing that has looked promising is potassium permanganate baths, which someone else commented helped them immensely.  It's prescribed by dermatologists in the worst case of hand eczema.  It's something I would bring up to my dermatologist if I need to visit again. \n\n---\nTOPICAL STERIODS DO NOT WORK LONG TERM\n\nTreating eczema with topical steroids is in a sense like treating pneumonia with prednisone.  It alleviates the symptoms, and from the perspective of the patient seems to treat the symptoms, but in reality it does absolutely nothing for the underlying causes, and actually makes them worse. \n\nWhat topical steroids do is weaken the immune system.  So the immune response to the various bacteria / fungus penetrating the microbiome goes away -- the redness, the itchiness, the oozing... \n\nBut the topical steroids worsen skin barrier significantly, and since the immune system is impaired, the bacteria / fungus penetrates deeper.  And so after the initial improvement, the long-term symptoms actually become worse. \n\n---\nR/ECZEMA\n\nI'm glad that this sub exists, but I'm generally disappointed with the quality of content.  We need to up our game ppl and stop posting stupid memes about our skin care routines.  Save that for r/skincareaddiction.  We can do so much better.   \n\nState your particular diagnosis or thesis as to what causes your eczema.  If you are not sure, start there and let people on this sub help point you to root causes. \n\nI'd be interested in what other treatments staph driven atopic people use. \n\nAlso very interested in people in their 40s, 50s, 60s... ?  Does it get worse as you get older?  Do skin infections get more persistent?  Interested to know how disease progresses (or if you have found techniques to manage it) for others who have staph driven eczema.\n\nThanks for reading this... Hope it helped someone. \n\nTLDR -- yeah, no way.  Each section has headers, hopefully useful for those who don't have time to read this entire post. ",

I can't use elidel or protopic because of serious side effects. So far, I've been able to mostly heal a terrible flare by washing my face with distilled water, and using skin care products filled with ceramides, niacinamide, and centella asiatica. All three of these ingredients have a decent amount of evidence demonstrating their efficacy on atopic skin. What I can't seem to do, however, is end the flare. I've been mostly successful at this when I use steroids, and I'm wondering if a short (2-3 day) course of topical steroids might help clear up the last few patches.",

I will share my experience.\n\nDiagnosed since .. basically from birth. Diagnosed atopic dermatitis (of the staph variety apparently) and ichthyosis vulgarous(very dry, scaly, flaky skin all over my body). My eczema is mild now but in the past it has been worse. I still have random itches around my body often but not intense itches and consistent red patches. \n\nI would like to counter the idea that topical steriods don't help (/are evil and should be avoided) by using something you stated - it's a feedback loop. Stop the loop, and you can stop it from getting worse. When I notice a red patch forming, I put some ts on and it generally goes away. Not to say it should be used daily and all over. Only as a means to break the loop early. For mild cases like mine I think it does help. I rarely need it.\n\nRelated to your salt water anectdote - bleach or vinegar baths will work as well. I tried vinegar on my own and my derm suggested bleach... Either way it will kill bacteria on the skin and it seems to help - it even soothed a very bad flareup/infection I had at the time. I don't have any personal experience with salt water helping.. any time I've gone to the beach, I get horrible sunburn so I wouldn't know.\n\nI find the I get more itchy if I forget to take my daily allergy medicine, so maybe I have contact dermatitis as well. I haven't noticed anything related to diet. I have noticed stress can make it worse. And I definitely have noticed I can't sweat as easily as everyone else and I have a tendency to overheat, or I get itchy skin prickles when I should be sweating. I never knew that could be particularly linked to eczema - though it can be from ichthyosis too. I guess I just have a double whammy there.",

I'm currently going through topical steroid withdrawal, as a previous GP prescribed steroid cream to put on my FACE, which (along with Prednisone) cleared me up.

So now I'm trying to quit all the meds and let my skin heal naturally, which I know will be a long process and the skin around my lips is actually much worse than before, which now I know is due to steroid withdrawal.\n\nLooking to combat this with diet (I am vegan but need to cut WAY back on my sugar intake) and natural creams. Currently using Bio Oil to spot treat as it seems to help. It comes in a dropper bottle, so I don't have to infect the supply - I'm glad you mentioned that because it never would have occurred to me!

I've spent hundreds of hours reading about my specific eczema, and you hit on many of the key points.\n\nYou mention Contact Dermatitis, but referred to it as an immediate reaction. Most of the research I've done suggests that an immediate reaction happens when it's an irritant, but a true allergy will trigger a delayed reaction. It's referred to as Allergic Contact Dermatitis. It's a Type IV allergy with a delayed response - several hours to days - which is typically diagnosed with a patch test.  \n\nI don't see that you had patch testing done. The testing you mentioned was for Type I allergens - molds, trees, food. Have you considered it? I went to several dermatologists/allergists before I found one that did the more extensive patch testing and identified over 15 allergens. Unfortunately, many of the allergens forced me to make significant changes in my diet, since many of the chemicals/ingredients occur naturally in food. Although diet changes might not help atopic dermatitis, it can definitely be a game changer for allergic contact dermatitis. It also explained why many of the \"favorite creams & steroids\" were causing me issues - I was allergic to some of their ingredients.\n\nPatch Testing\nhttps://www.chemotechnique.se/patch-testing/\n\nExplanation of Allergic Contact Dermatitis vs Irritant Contact Dermatitis\nhttps://www.the-dermatologist.com/sites/default/files/Regional%20Atlas%20of%20Contact%20Dermatitis%20Book_lr.pdf",

My specialist put me on an aziothioprine (immunosuppressant) to minimize the body’s immune response to allergens passing through the skin barrier.  We ramped up the dosage over 6 months, stayed at the high dosage for about 18 months and then ramped down completely off the drug.  Within a couple months or so of starting, the severity for my itching went from an 8 down to a zero.  It’s been 2-3 years since I’ve been completely off the medication now, and my itching hasn’t come back.  Over time my skin feels slightly dryer, but for all intents and purposes it’s now virtually gone.

    "body": " Not strictly skin care but I know many people suffer from regular cold sores and as someone who gets probably 2 to 3 cold sores a year I’ve actually come up with a decent treatment which either lets the sore heal much quicker or even prevents them from blistering and recedes within a day or two.\n\nI’ve tried quite a few things over the years so here is my experience:\n\nFirst thing, be prepared. When you feel a cold sore is coming on and the tingling starts you need everything required to treat it ***immediately***. You don’t want to be waiting 8 hours until you finish work to get to the pharmacy. So ensure you have Zovirax on-hand pretty much anywhere you go, keep a tube at home and at work/in your car so there is always one within reach.\n\nOnce you feel the tingling, you need to be applying Aciclovir cream immediately, the sooner the better. The guidance is every few hours but you want to be putting a new dose on every 20 MINUTES! Seriously, this antiviral cream can send a cold sore packing before it even starts so don’t skimp on it.\n\nIf the cold sore looks like it is going to keep developing regardless, then make sure you are taking 3-4g of lysine powder a day in 1g doses throughout. You can buy this for about £7 on Amazon for 100g. What I also do is apply some tea tree oil a few times a day using a cotton bud too as an additional treatment to the aciclovir cream.\n\nWhat I’ve discovered is that contrary to what you may read you DO NOT want the blister to pop and you don’t want it to dry out either. Skin heals quicker in a moist environment so at night I applied something like sudocrem with a bit of vaseline over it so it can stay quite moist for the duration you are asleep. \n\nFollowing the above normally means my cold sores never pop into an unsightly scab which takes probably 2 weejs to heal. I find I can go through the cycle within about a week now.\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that the next few weeks after a cold sores you are in high risk of getting another, I often get another a few weeks after the first. So you should stay vigilant during this time, restock on any creams you’ve used up, keep taking a low dose (1g a day) of lysine and monitor the site of the prior sore for any re-emergence. Any slight tingle, then start applying the aciclovir again. Don't risk it coming back. I’ve managed to stop some re-emerging at all by doing the above.\n\nOf course try and take multivitamins and eat a healthy diet, lots fo water etc. Burt you should be doing that anyway ;) and yes the best treatment is prevention so wear sunscreen/lip balm with spf.\n\nSome other things people try and recommend are honey, green tea, normal tea but I found these never really had much effect. \n\nI have also tried applying cold sores patches (which are just hydrocolloid patches) but I find these never stay on as I am trying to keep the lip moist with creams this never works for me.\n\nOf course all of the above is just on my experience, you may have your own tips and tricks which work better for you!",

As soon as a tingle started get the stick thing out and keep on at it until you feel that it isn't getting any bigger/tingling anymore.

        "body": "I have gotten them for years & this is how I get them to be completely gone within 4 days after the bumps have already formed & this skips the scabbing phase as well & shrinks it until it’s gone. Ideally you want to catch it before blisters happen, but if you wake up & it’s too late, this works for me. I AM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL THIS IS JUST WHAT I DO.\n\n1.\t⁠⁠Acyclovir prescription is A MUST. Take 2000MG immediately & then another 2000MG 12 hours later. Note: I do this for TWO days in a row just to be safe. I got a 90-day script from my doc since I get them frequently & have them on hand as needed.\n\n2.\t⁠⁠Immediately take 2000MG of Lysine (I take 2000MG 3x/day on day 1) then 1000MG 3x/day for every day after. You will most likely get diarrhea from the Day 1 lysine intake (very watery so stay by a toilet), but I would much rather have diarrhea for a day than a raging cold sore.\n\n3.\t⁠⁠Every night put on a Mederma Cold Sore Patch before bed. They last for 12 hours & work wonders with a much quicker healing process. You can even use it during the day if you want.\n\n4.\t⁠⁠If the cold core is really bad, then during the day you can soak a q-tip with tea tree oil and apply 3x/day. I use pure tea tree oil & don’t care about the pain because I hate them so much I want them gone immediately.\n\n5.\t⁠Get Vitamin C tablets with elderberry & echinacea and Zinc tablets to consume while you have an active outbreak to give your immune system the extra boost it needs.\n\n6.\t⁠Ice, ice, ice on Day 1 as much as possible.\n\nNOTE: They are EXTREMELY CONTAGIOUS & you can pass them to your partner easily. Don’t do oral or kiss while you have any sign of one or even feel one coming on. Also, don’t use a towel on your face that you would use on your body just to be safe.\n\nTips: Avoid chocolate, nuts, wheat, and any other foods high in arginine (avoid in general if you get them frequently, and especially when you have an active cold sore). Also wear SPF chapstick constantly when you’re in the sun and never let your lips get chapped. Sun and cold wind cause outbreaks…as well as partying, no sleep, hormones, and stress. Good luck!!",

Your doctor or dentist can prescribe acyclovir tablet 400 mg which you can take 2 as soon as you feel the tingling but best way is to know your body and when you've had a long tiring day/night either due to stress, insomnia/lack of sleep, intense physical activity, drinking, cold, sun exposure then just take your tablet which is a very effective preventive measure. Although I know it's not easy/affordable to see a doctor in some countries for a cold sore that has not developed yet or for something that can be treated with OTC cream.

I was in my early twenties, cutting through from a grocery store back to a friend’s house, jumped a chain link fence and one of the sharp tops went into my palm. I kept saying I was fine. I was. One of those sharp cuts that don’t really hurt. But my friend wanted to clean it and she had tea tree oil, first Id ever really heard of it, so she cleaned it and then we all drank lots of Gentleman Jack that was fairly new at the time. The cut didn’t leave a scar or anything. For some reason that night has always been one of those highlighted nights, like a fixed point in time feeling, and not for any good reason. You can tell from my story it wasn’t a special night. But its just always been a surface memory when it shouldn’t be a very memorable thing at all. \n\nSO, yesterday I looked down and that exact circular cut was fresh on my palm. My immediate thought was of that night. And in general there is not a reasonable explanation for the cut. I was sitting on the couch watching tv. \n\nTime slip!! There is *something* about that night \nthat wont leave me! But this is weird as shit. \n\n\n",

    "body": "Hi everyone :) I have finally achieved beautiful, flawless skin (Thank you SCA!!!!) and thought I would share my tips with you so you can achieve healthy skin too <3 Unfortunately I don't have a B&A picture to show you guys my amazing progress because I was too self conscious to take a picture of my skin when it wasn't perfect. Sorry!\n\nSome info about my skin: \n\n* It's very, very pale, like to the point that no shade of foundation matches my skin :/ It's kind of annoying but I'm still very proud of how pale I am (I look like one of those pale beautiful Korean goddesses who all have perfect skin! Looking Korean is #skincaregoals \\^\\^) \n\n* I also had really bad fungal acne (not diagnosed by a dermatologist though, they don't really know what they're doing and don't think outside the box... can't trust them...) but I finally cured it by cutting mushrooms out of my diet! \n\n* I also had very dehydrated skin but I fixed my damaged moisture barrier by using lots of thin hydrating layers (at least 14 hydrating layers of toner, essence, serum, ampoule each night before my 5 moisturizers). My skin just DRINKS IT IN!\n\nNow let's get started <3\n\n**Tip 1: Sun protection!!!!!!**\n\nSPF is the most important part of any routine because it will prevent your skin from aging. There is nothing worse than wrinkles, not even skin cancer. But if you go out in the sun, you will most likely get skin cancer! There is NO reason to go outside because you can get all your required vitamin D from supplements. No excuses! You can also buy blackout curtains on Amazon and this will help a lot.\n\n My mom is 90 years old but she looks like she's 35 (GOALS!!!) and she's the reason I wear sunscreen every day :) even when I am indoors and during the evening. People laugh at how diligent I am with sunscreen but when they're old and wrinkly and ugly, I'll have the last laugh because my skin will be so smooth and flawless \\^\\^. But make sure to triple cleanse every night before bed; if you don't wash your face before going to bed, your SPF will suffocate your skin and make you break out. Your skin needs to breathe!\n\nGetting a good sunscreen is also important. American sunscreens aren't protective enough so I only use high end brands from South Korea. My current HG sunscreen is called Biore Watery Essence and I highly recommend it. (But apparently there is some controversy about if it's a sunscreen or not, because \"sunscreen\" isn't in the name of the product... Can anyone verify this? :/)\n\n**Tip 2: Healthy lifestyle changes!!**\n\nI cut out dairy, gluten, meat, mushrooms, and sugar from my diet. I also eat all-organic. This has helped improve my fungal acne a lot. Healthy eating is absolutely key to healthy skin! You should also drink at least 8 gallons of water each day, but if you're really serious about skincare, I recommend an IV drip to keep hydrated all day :) My first time using an IV drip was when I had to go to the ER to get my stomach pumped from drinking too much alcohol and when I regained consciousness the next day, my skin looked SO DEWY. So I bought my own IV drip and it is one of the best purchases I've ever made; it has made my skin so plump and bouncy! So much chok chok!\n\nThere are lots of other important lifetstyle changes to make too. You shouldn't use straws or smile, because that can cause smile lines and crow's feet to form. I switch my pillow case every 3 hours each night too, to prevent breaking out from a dirty pillow case. A silk pillow case with at least 600 thread count is the best type you can buy. Sleeping on your back is also important, because sleeping on your side will squish your face and cause more wrinkles. You should also turn your screen brightness setting to the lowest setting, because the light from your computer and phone can also cause aging. You should also avoid smoking because it really ages your skin quickly and causes smile lines from the constant puckering. \n\n**Tip 3: Avoid bad products and ingredients!!**\n\nThis is SO important (but not as important as sunscreen!). You can't use harsh products like St. Ives apricot scrub (more like SATAN IVES, amirite?! Haha!). In fact, all physical exfoliation is off the table, it's just too harsh for the delicate facial skin and will cause micro-tears. Chemical exfoliation is the only way to go and it's much more gentle, such as a 60% glycolic acid toner.\n\nDrugstore products are also bad; they are too cheap and will mess up your skin (but if you're a poor teenager it's okay to use them until you have more money (my 6'5\" boyfriend makes 200k and buys all my skincare stuff, I love him so much)). The only acceptable drugstore product is CeraVe (has anyone else ever heard of it btw?). CeraVe in the tub is pretty amazing and will fix all your problems. Dry skin? Fixed! Acne? Fixed! Wrinkles? Fixed! Broken leg? Fixed! Student debt? Fixed! It really is a miracle product! It's my HG moisturizer but I never see anyone talk about it! XD\n\nYou also have to avoid comedogenic ingredients (like coconut oil) and keep track of any ingredients you might be sensitive to. For example, I'm allergic to fatty alcohols, silicones, oils, fragrance, vaseline, oxybenzone, hyaluronic acid, parabens, and sulfates. You should also avoid products that come in tubs instead of pumps because every time you dip your dirty fingers in the tub, bacteria will start growing in your product and it will also oxidize within 2 weeks. A quick fix for this is to use a spoon or spatula to scoop out the product. Sanitize it with bleach before and after each use to make sure you don't contaminate your products.\n\n**Tip 4: Have a good routine and be consistent!!**\n\nAs I said earlier, it's important to wash your face every night (and also every morning). Even when I get white girl wasted, I always make sure to wash my face before I go to bed and do my 25-step routine. I'm always so proud of myself when I manage to take care of my skin in spite of my alcoholism :) If I am blacked out though, my boyfriend will do my routine for me.\n\nHere's my routine (AM and PM):\n\n1. Get very drunk\n2. La Mer makeup remover (if I wore makeup that day but I'm really pretty so most days I don't wear makeup)\n3. Bioderma micellar water\n4. Drunk Elephant oil cleanser\n5. Clinique foaming cleanser\n6. Direct water flushing\n7. Tretinoin 18%\n8. Estee Lauder vitamin c serum 28%\n9. Paula's Choice BHA 15%\n10. Pixi Glow Tonic 20% AHA (glycolic acid)\n11. La Mer 17% AHA (lactic acid)\n12. Dr. Wu 19% AHA (mandelic acid) (by the way it's important to use each type of AHA because they have different molecule sizes)\n13. Neutrogena benzoyl peroxide 5%\n14. SK-II FTE (7 skins)\n15. Hada Labo hydrating toner (7 skins)\n16. Lancome anti acne snail essence\n17. The Ordinary niacinamide serum\n18. Drunk Elephant tea tree oil ampoule\n19. Innisfree sheet mask with my boyfriend :) <3\n20. Dr Jart ceramidin liquid\n21. Philosophy eye cream\n22. Neutrogena hydrogel cream\n23. Drunk elephant facial oil\n24. CeraVe in the tub\n25. Laneige sleeping mask\n\nI also will redo my whole routine after me and my boyfriend have sex (which is like, all the time!) because I don't want my face to break out. (Btw, my boyfriend doesn't have any skincare routine, like he never washes his face but his skin still looks really good? I don't understand and I'm so jealous T_T.)\n\n**Tip 5: Research!**\n\nWhenever I'm not sure about something, I make sure to do my research by asking internet forums for help! If you're confused about your products, don't be scared to ask \"How do I use these products I just bought?\" or \"Can someone recommend a routine for me?\" or \"Has anyone ever used this product before?\". If there's something growing on your face, you can also post a picture of it and ask \"What's this on my face and how do I get rid of it?\" People on the internet love to help so you don't have to do the research yourself, others will do it for you :)\n\nThe internet is soooo helpful and is an amazing resource. I highly recommend asking your questions on the internet instead of asking a dermatologist because they're not trustworthy. For example, I asked my dermatologist to prescribe me a strong retinoid and she said no because my skin was \"already healthy\"... Doesn't she know that everyone needs actives to prevent aging and keep your skin at maximum healthiness though... I was so surprised because she's supposed to be the best dermatologist in my city but she was an idiot. But a little tip for you guys! Go to a dumber dermatologist and lie to them to get the prescriptions you want :) If anyone is interested, I can post a guide on how to draw realistic looking zits and scars on your face so you can get whichever prescription you want.\n\n\n\nEdit: formatting because I'm a dumb pore :-)",

She’s the kind of guest that makes things more difficult by trying to be ‘no bother’. \n\nFor example we asked her what things she needed to have in the house, toiletries, snacks etc before she arrived and she said she didn’t need anything. Then she needed to get stuff but wouldn’t tell us what it was so we had to go to 3 different stores to get all the things she needed. \n\nWe work full time and have the baby so that was inconvenient.\n\nWe cloth diaper the baby and with all these shopping trips and cooking/prepping for Thanksgiving I am a bit behind on normal laundry (all my clothes are in an unfolded pile right now) so of course MIL needs her laundry done.\n\nShe says she will do it herself but machine is in the nursery so if I let her do it she will probably mess with baby nap schedule, so I will do it but she wants to use her Tide pods that she brought from home (which I am very allergic to) she says she is allergic to our detergent because she had a bad sinus problem when she got to our house caused by the sheets in the guest room. I offer to wash the sheets with her clothes in her detergent and she says no need because she has sprinkled tea tree oil on them so they are fine now??????? \n\nAlso we are trying to be a plastic free home so I don’t really want to use pod detergent in my machine.\n\nThen we got a shipment of shampoo bars in the mail, different kinds from one brand my husband and I wanted to try we had 4 bars and when I went to move them to our bathroom I only found 3, if she wanted to take one to try herself she just needed to ask but now I have to look all around the house to see if I dropped it somewhere. \n\nI keep finding doors and drawers open and shelves rearranged because while my husband and I are working she’s just going through all of our stuff.",

Since I don’t see a spot dedicated to PIE in the sidebar, I compiled some information to share with you guys.\n\n#Post Inflammatory Erythema\n\n**What it is:**\nWhen you have a pimple that swells blood flow to that area is increased to promote healing. This increased blood flow can lead to capillary damage that looks red/pink. It is temporary, and therefore not a true scar. \n\n**How to tell if your red mark is PIE:**\nPush on the red mark for a few seconds and quickly lift your finger. If the area loses color while depressed, then congrats! You have PIE. Alternatively, you could use a clean, clear item to see the mark when depressed (like a disinfected flip cap to an eyeshadow ^I ^may ^have ^done ^this ^before, ^like ^a ^lot).\n\n**Prevention:**\nRoutines/lifestyles/medications that decrease breakouts—obviously not all acne can be prevented.\nNot picking your blemishes!\nKeeping your pimples moisturized and protecting them with hydrocolloid bandages can reduce your chances of developing PIE.\n\n**At Home Treatments**\n\n*What doesn’t work:*\nHarsh cleansers\nHarsh physical exfoliation\nLemon juice\nUndiluted tea tree oil\nUndiluted vitamin E \n\n*What works:*\nTime—These spots usually fade in 3-12 months.\nSunscreen—An absolute must! Ignoring this can increase your odds of the PIE spot turning into a PIH spot.\nVitamin C products—20% concentration of l'ascorbic acid works best.\nRetinoids—increases cell turnover and promotes collagen production. This will make you sun sensitive so be serious about sunscreen!\nChemical exfoliation—a great choice in this instance is azelaic acid, which increases cell turnover and reduces redness. Remember your sunscreen!\nNiacinamide—great anti-inflammatory, 4%+ is most effective concentration, also works well for PIH.\nGreen tea extract/oil—another anti-inflammatory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I suspect that this fish also has lymphocystis, a viral infection. Could be due to the fish's weakened health caused by the worm infection. If there are any other fish that have lived with this little guy they should also be treated with the levamisole. Camallanus worms are live bearing and release live larvae directly into the water. These larvae can live for months in the substrate until they find a host. The worms protruding from the anus are the female worms that are releasing larvae into the water.

    "body": "Foreword: I'm making this post because I commented in a thread a while ago about how I had low-grade, super stubborn fungal acne for a long time and a lot of users replied that they may have it as well (based on symptoms) and it never before occurred to them that it was a fungal, and not bacterial, infection. So, I'm trying to include as much info as possible to help people that may be in the situation that I was before. I apologize in advance that I don't have before and after pics, but I'll link to a blog that does. Please let me know if I've forgotten anything or made any mistakes, and feel free to share your fungal acne stories!\n\nObviously I'm not a doctor so if your symptoms are getting worse or you're in pain or you have anything else that should be sending you to the doctor JUST GET OFF THE INTERNET AND GO TO THE DOCTOR\n\nFirst of all, having fungus on your skin is totally normal (as gross as it sounds) as it is part of the natural flora of your skin composition. The most common type of skin fungus is of course yeast, and as you know (since I think this sub is mainly women) when it grows out of control it can cause a yeast infection, typically in the vagina, where it is warm and moist. The type of fungus that most commonly results in acne-like pustules on your skin is called *Malassezia* and the resulting infection is known as *Pityrosporum folliculitis*. \n\nThe reason why we get yeast infections is because there is not enough \"good\" bacteria present to use up the resources that both bacteria and yeast utilize, so when yeast out-competes \"good\" bacteria, it takes over and wreaks havoc ranging from low-grade irritation all the way to something as severe as seborrheic dermatitis. Other fungal infections you may be familiar with include athletes foot/jock itch, ringworm and tinea versicolor.  \n\n**How can you tell if you have it?**\n\nIf you're willing to go to the doctor/derm, there are tests they can run using live cultures generated from your skin swab. This is the most sure-fire way to get a diagnosis as well as potent prescription anti-fungals. \n\nIf you are an armchair physician like me and don't care about experimenting with OTC creams on your face, you can grab some at-home treatments (listed below) to see if your skin improves.\n\n**Some of the associated symptoms with *Malassezia* overgrowth include:**\n\n* Small pimple-like bumps that have small whiteheads which small amounts of pus will come out of (AFAIK cystic acne is less common but still possible with this type of infection). They typically occur in your T-zone but can appear on cheeks as well and are usually clustered together and around follicles. i.e. it's damn hard to differentiate it between regular acne, and the differences are quite subtle.\n* Rash/pain/tenderness/itching/burning sensation - can lead to seborrheic dermatitis - these are some symptoms that should be sending you to the doctor anyway.\n* Redness\n* Closed comedomes that don't turn into open comedomes and will just crust over if you pick at them.\n* Pimples that don't respond to traditional acne treatment i.e. benzoyl peroxide, and take a long time to disappear.\n\n**What not to use if you suspect fungal acne**\n\nMalassezia and other strains of fungus typically [feed on oils with a fatty acid chain length of 11-24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1198797/pdf/biochemj00724-0062.pdf). This is also why fungal acne often appears in areas where sebum production is higher than other parts of the body. So, obviously avoid using oils that are in this range - [here is a somewhat reliable chart (the URL kinda sketches me out but it seems accurate, but do some more digging if you're not convinced)](http://www.scientificpsychic.com/fitness/fattyacids.html). FWIW coconut oil has a very long chain length and is considered safe for fungus treatment. \n\nEdit: From /u/SnailsonAcid It helps to look up images of the chemical structures of the ingredients in potential products, and counting the number of carbons in a carbon chain. For example, if an ingredient has a carbon chain length of 7, the chemical structure will have something that looks like this VVV. Skin prone to fungal infections have sebum deficient in ceramides. I can't use most bb creams as they often have ingredients with long carbon chains, but have had some success with Liole triple the solution.\n\nAnother thing to avoid is creating an extremely moist environment on your face (which I know goes against everything this sub stands for, but if you want to get rid of fungus you're going to have to be a bit drier than normal for at least a month). This means no occlusives, mainly. You can use a hydrating toner before treatments, but **avoid toners/essences with ferments in them**. Even though it's a ferment filtrate, it can still activate specific receptors on yeast cells that will trigger the growth of more yeast.\n\nAvoid anything containing any types of sugars since yeast eats sugar. I know honey is a potent anti-microbial but I think the amount of sugar in it would negate those effects. \n\nAntibiotics will also increase your risk of getting fungal acne. I strongly believe these are what caused my bout of fungal acne, but sometimes they are an unavoidable part of life. Just be wary that if you do have to take antibiotics, future fungal infections are more likely. \n\n**What to rub all over your face when you have fungal acne**\n\n(obviously **patch test** these things if you haven't used them before because they can induce an allergic reaction or worse. Also, a lot of this is anecdotal and worked for me during my struggle with fungal acne so obviously YMMV.) These are all OTC.\n\n* Aloe (science doesn't know why, but somehow aloe breaks down the protective biofilm of fungus)\n* Plain yoghurt (use as a wash-off mask)\n* Turmeric\n* Zinc (I used The Ordinary niacinamide + zinc, niacinamide won't trigger fungal growth AFAIK. Anything containing zinc is usually good, but check for other fungal triggers in the product)\n* Tea tree oil (general antimicrobial, dilute in a carrier oil)\n* Diluted apple cider vinegar (yeast doesn't do well in an acidic environment, they prefer pH 4-8)\n* Sulphur (I used a zinc/sulphur soap on my face alternately with ketoconazole wash)\n* Ketoconazole (a.k.a.

Drying your clothing in a dryer on \"high\" and disinfecting as much of your skin care bottles and tools with alcohol is also another way to help prevent re-infection.\n\nHere's a link to a blog where a woman had a pervasive and relatively severe fungal acne infection, she has some before pictures that are similar to what I had (although mine didn't get quite that bad). http://longhairedatheart.blogspot.ca/2013/11/yeast-had-caused-my-bad-skin.html",

        "body": "I definitely have this, diagnosed at the derm, and have a little insight. The carbon chain thing you pointed out is super important in finding suitable skincare products. It helps to look up images of the chemical structures of the ingredients in potential products, and counting the number of carbons in a carbon chain. For example, if an ingredient has a carbon chain length of 7, the chemical structure will have something that looks like this VVV. Skin prone to fungal infections have sebum deficient in ceramides. Some products that I've used successfully (after going through a ton!) include albolene (non-AB), BR P50, shark sauce, snowbang, Benton snail bee high content skin, diluted ACV, and eltamd am (non-AB). I can't use most bb creams as they often have ingredients with long carbon chains, but have had some success with Liole triple the solution. Hope this helps anyone who may be struggling with this as it definitely makes skin care much more challenging! \n\nEdit: forgot to mention, MCT/fractionated coconut oil is outside of the carbon chain range and can be safely used!",

        "body": "This was me just this past September. Mine started on my jawline and temples then moved to my neck, chest and upper back. I don't have terribly reactive or acne-prone skin so it was weird to see (especially my neck). The itchiness was my tip off that something was up and different from the pimples I've had before. I sort of diagnosed myself but did see my derm who wasn't positive what it was and when I told him my suspicion he agreed it could be. He gave me a script for Diflucan and said to keep up with everything I was trying. \nI did quite a bit of research, more than I would have had I not gotten involved in this sub (Thank You!!!) which sparked a desire for knowledge of ingredients and such. I found quite a lot on the internet that I didn't really understand but was able to piece some stuff together & just started trying different products/ingredients. \nHead & Shoulders, Selsun Blue & Nizoral: the H&S seemed to work the best for me. I tried them all on my face but also switched using them as body washes. I switched them up because I read the yeast can build a tolerance to things. \n\nSulphur: I found a bar soap, Sal 3, and also a mask (Dr. Gross Collidal Sulpur). Both of these I still use & they work great! (I think the soap has some salicylic acid in it too)\n\nNeem oil & MCT oil: both of these do not have long chains. What I found suggested staying away from all oils that had long chains which includes coconut oil & tea tree oil. The yeast feeds on it as well as fatty alcohol. I still use a diy mixture of these two as my oil cleanser and sometimes I use a few drops towards the end of my routine if my skin is feeling dry. The smell of neem is very strong and very earthy. I'm used to it now but I had to start with a tiny bit mixed with the MCT and just build up to more. I love these and have a hard time seeing myself not using them. \n\nSalicylic acid: great product that I believe helped quite a bit too. I ended up trying a product of my bf and saw a difference. Bought some for myself to put in a spray bottle for my chest & upper back. That's when those little bastards finally started going away!\n\nOnce I realized it was starting to subside I slowly introduced different products back in, partly to see if I would have a flair up and partly because I desperately needed hydration in my skin! So much of the above is quite drying, which really is what I was going for! Dry out the \"food\" for the yeast and get it back to a normal level. I'm still playing around with actives in my routine because of the over-drying I did. If I use them too often I seem to get extra dry & flaky. I did recently see someone post about buffering actives & that is definitely helping.",

        "body": "I did some research and started protocol targeted towards fungal acne, and it finally cured my acne completely. I'm not sure if it was a combination of things, one particular thing, or if it was just mere coincidence, but here's what I did (in chronological order):  \n\n- 50mg doxycycline (antibiotic) 2x a day for 6 months - prescribed first by my Curology derm, then my GP  \n- Curology - 1% clindamycin, 8% Azelaic Acid, **1% Zinc pyrithione** (started on the basic 4/1/4 formula and changed to this)  \n- Head & Shoulders Shampoo (**1% zinc pyrithione**) & Nizoral Shampoo (**1% Ketoconazole**) alternating, follow with regular 2nd cleanser - also use on scalp & hairline in the shower. Do not underestimate these guys - they are actually kind of lovely, non-drying cleansers for the face XD    \n- Deciem The Ordinary 10% Niacinamide, **1% Zinc PCA**  \n- **Tretoin 0.025%** Cream 4x a week (prescribed by my GP) - I believe this was doing the bulk of the work as I started to see drastic improvement immediately  \n- 8 week course of Fluconazole (anti-fungal pills, prescribed by my Curology derm) - not sure if this did anything bc I started it around the same time as the tret, but my acne hasn't come back since I finished the course, even when I didn't use tretinoin or any other acne treatments for a week while traveling  \n\nAnother important thing was that I stopped using all other acne treatments, masks, and sheet masks during this time, aside from the occasional use of a pink powder (sulphur) spot treatment for particularly bad breakouts. My derm recommended I stay away from otc treatments like salicylic acid, retinol, etc. because they may cause more irritation than improvement, which turned out to be the case for me. I cut down to a very minimal routine, aside from the listed above - Re:cipe Slowganic Cleanser > Thayer's Toner > Cerave PM > Cosrx Aloe sunscreen. No oil cleanser, just micellar water to remove makeup. I've also been avoiding oils and alcohol like the plague, as this can aggravate or \"feed\" fungal acne. I've also tried Noble Soap, which was recommended by my Curology derm, but it broke me out in cc's so didn't work for me. I much prefer Head & Shoulders & Nizoral for this.    \n\nAnother important thing that has really been a game changer is to **tie your hair while you sleep** (I do a top bun bc it's more comfortable) - this minimizes the oils from your hair getting on your face during the night, and of course changing/flipping your pillowcases often is important too. This has really helped clear/prevent breakouts on the sides of my face.    \n\nHope this is helpful to somebody!",

My damaged moisture barrier has resulted in me experiencing fungal acne for 4 months now. I find that Nizoral shampoo along with an anti-jock cream like canesten has really helped when I get flare ups, but I don't want to have to rely on these for the rest of my life.  I've also read that resistance can be built up against the active ingredient which would be Ketoconazole and that's worrying to me.\n\nI'm trying to repair my damaged moisture barrier, but I'm really not having luck.  Like you said, ceramides are deficient in the sebum when you're prone to fungal issues so I'm trying to load up on my ceramides. I currently use clinique ddmg, but my skin dries up so quickly after that.  I recently introduced a hyaluronic acid serum that has ceramides from GOW that contains a preservative \"lactobicillus ferment\".  Does anyone know if this will trigger the fungal acne? \n\nI'm also looking at purchasing Meishoku Ceracolla Perfect Gel and ElsaGusa Ceramide Moist Essence.  Anyone with fungal acne used these products before?  It doesn't look like there's ferment in the ingredients, but I could be wrong.  I'll list the ingredients at the bottom of this comment if anyone wants to take a look. It's incredibly frustrating to have to deal with severely dehydrated skin and fungal acne.  One needs a ton of moisture to resolve it and the other one wants none of it.  I have no idea how to approach my problem.  I'm only 23, but my pores look incredibly massive, I have deep wrinkles on my forehead and under my eyes, my skin gets tight and feels like paper immediately after moisturizing, and itches like crazy all due to my dehydration.

I've got a lot of the same things you do, like the Prid. My primary preventarive topical medication is Clindamyacin gel and daily Hiniclens. I also like manuka honey for open wounds. A money saving tip that works for me: I couldn't easily get affordable Manuka honey bandages, so I got a small jar of Manuka Honey from Walmart and use tongue depressors to apply it to the wound, then cover with gauze and bandage. The small jar is still mostly full after a year and honey never expires. Also on the bandage front, the skin in my armpits is so sensitive that I can't put adhesive bandages there without scarring from them (even the sensitive skin ones), so I got silicone bandage tape (from a tip here) and apply it around the edges of gauze pads. Works great for me! In the worst wound situations, panty liners to stick to clothing as a back-up to bandages are my best item for sleeping without getting stains on clothes.",

I really just want to spread the word about this to as many HS sufferers as possible. I’m receiving ZERO compensation for posting this.\n\nSerragold- check out my attached image if the bottle. Every time I felt a flare up (always in the same place- inside of thigh) I pop one of these babies and within 24 hours it’s receding. I haven’t had a flare up in a really long time so it’s possible my being perimenopausal has something to do with it- bonus for getting older! I stumbled upon this many years ago after I was first diagnosed with HS and found it was still relatively unknown. Very effective! If you happen to grab this from Amazon and try it please post about your results! I’d love to know that I’m not the only one this has been effective for.\n\n￼​\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nm3f5jrz13ue1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d6fbc5c645a7e581251d55084c798ea8ad5b570",

    "body": "In August 2021 I had just started a new job and a week later I was thrown into another total Covid lockdown (australia). I had been dating a man for 3 months and it wasn’t working, so I ended it. And most frustratingly, no matter what I tried, my scalp was always flaking, itching, burning, and even bleeding. \n\nI went to Aldi on my lunch break one day, one of the few places that was allowed to open, and they were selling men’s clippers. ‘Fuck it’ I thought, ‘who knows how long this lock down will last?’ I’d tried everything from Head & Shoulders, Tea Tree Oil Shampoo, Tar Shampoo, even Nizoral 2%. So I shaved it all off. \n\nI used Aveeno generously on my scalp once my hair was gone to get it healthy again. As my hair grew I used Nizoral 2% consistently which kept my scalp healthy, but damaged my hair a bit. I used Coco & Eve like a virgin masque as conditioner every wash, and their miracle elixir which helped a bit. \n\nEarlier this year I started using L’Oréal Dream Lengths shampoo and conditioner. Recently my scalp has been a bit inflamed and flaky again so I’m doing some damage control with Nizoral, it makes my hair awfully greasy though. I think moving forward I’ll keep using Dream Lengths and do a few washes with Nizoral whenever my scalp flares up. \n\nIn between washes I have been using rosemary water some evenings with a scalp massage (fresh rosemary boiled in water for 15 min in a spray bottle), Mielle rosemary oil on my scalp the night before I wash, L’Oréal Elvive Extraordinary Oil Jojoba daily, I dust my hair frequently and am very gentle with brushing, I did a couple of applications of K18, I sleep with a satin night cap 95% of the time (I don’t wash them frequently enough though which could be contributing to my scalp issues), I hardly ever use heat tools (I did a blow dry on warm before the last photo because I’m going out tonight), and I’ve stopped using scrunchies completely — I only use claw clips and hair pins. I also used a 0.3mm derma roller on my scalp once a week for about 6 weeks, but stopped because I wasn’t seeing any change and didn’t want to damage my scalp. \n\nMy hair has always been a big part of my identity, and more often than not, a visible warning as to my mental state. I’ve bleached, dyed, chemically straightened, cut bangs both from professionals and at home, but shaving is the last thing I hope to ever do to negatively impact my hair health. Well, except for smoking the occasional cigarette and frequent weed. \n\nI looked fugly with shaved, short, pixie length hair, but I don’t regret it. It was something I’d always thought about, and at the time it was something I needed to do. And now my hair and scalp are fairly healthy and I’m learning how to keep it that way ❤️",

    "body": "I feel like I need to spread the warning on using essential oil on pets because it happened to my poor puppy. So my dog who is 14 years old suddenly showed serious signs of illness a couple weeks ago and I got a call from my mom telling me he needed to see a vet right away. I was shocked to receive the call as my mom never calls me to worry me while I’m at school. Long story short, the vet couldn’t tell us exactly why he was suddenly feeling sick and said it must be bc of his age. I decided to take him to school with me to keep an eye on him and he definitely showed improvement (eating again, wanting to go out for walks)!! However, his conditions were noticeably different/ worsened again when we came home for thanksgiving break. A few days ago, I read a post on facebook about a dog mom using tea tree oil on her puppy and noticing a weird behavior and finding out later that tea tree oil is TOXIC to dogs. I asked my mom about using tea tree oil on Oreo and she said she did in fact put a couple drops in the spray he gets after he goes for a walk to wipe his little feet and on his back for the pesky little ticks and fleas. I believe this was the cause! The vet couldn’t tell us exactly why he was showing signs of confusion and almost depression-like symptoms where he didn’t want to be touched and left alone. I strongly believe he was behaving this way because of the tea tree oil. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT USE IT ON YOUR PETS! Please share and help me get the word out ",

    "body": "Dehydrated skin is not a skin type as much as it is a condition of the skin. It doesn't discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin and can be aggravated by topical skin care as much as lifestyle (binge drinking or smoking, for instance). \n\nIt's hard to describe dehydrated skin, since I feel it can present itself differently in many people. However, in my experience, it's generally skin that appears lackluster and dull, sallow or \"tired,\" and when pulled taut, it almost seems to wrinkle a bit. Dehydrated skin doesn't \"bounce back\" easily and is more prone to congestion (bumps, blackheads) and acne. It generally soaks up moisturizer yet looks oily in spots and feels dry as a bone in others.\n\nThe first thing to consider, and the most obvious, is moisture content. Do you drink adequate amounts of water a day? This doesn't mean chugging water until you feel like a portable kiddie pool, but you should be drinking 4-6 glasses a day. \n\nAnother facet of moisture is how much moisture is around your skin and what is on your skin to drink that moisture up (and hold it to the skin itself). For people in drier environments or simply those of us prone to dry or dehydrated skin, I highly recommend investing in a warm mist humidifier (cold mist must be cleaned more frequently and makes a room feel clammy). I run mine virtually every night, and it makes a noticeable difference in how plump my skin remains throughout the day and night.\n\nYou also want to be paying attention to what kind of ingredients are holding moisture to your skin and how you are using them. I'm talking humectants here, such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and squalene.\n\n[Glycerin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol) is easily the most recognizable and common humectant. It should never be applied straight, though a couple drops can be added to your favourite moisturizer if you feel in need of a boost. It *is* fairly sticky though, so I wouldn't recommend adding more than two drops. On that note, I recommend against doing this during the day, since it can make skin more \"shiny\" and sticky. \n\nGlycerin is found in most skincare products and is widely available. It is also an acne trigger in a small number of people.\n\n[Hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) is a naturally derived ingredient that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. It is very light, thin, and usually is not sticky. It is most commonly found in serums, but is also becoming more widely used in creams and lotions. It is best applied to damp skin (not sopping wet, but not completely patted dry either) during your water-soluable phase. If you're using it as a serum, follow it with a rich moisturizer.\n\nSome people find hyaluronic acid drying. Your mileage may vary.\n\nSome examples of products containing hyaluronic acid:\n\n* SERUM. [Garden of Wisdom Hyaluronic Acid Serums](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/hyaluronic.html) are fabulously light-weight and effective. They are also very reasonably priced. You can purchase a sampler pack to try, which has enough product to last you 1-2 months, depending on usage. I suggest trying the cosmocil CQ blend of preservatives if your skin is sensitive.\n\n* CREAMS AND LOTIONS. [CeraVe](http://www.lovelyskin.com/products.asp?MID=119) products are fabulous if they work well for your skin. I'm sure readers of this subreddit get tired of hearing us talk about CeraVe, but they are reasonably priced, widely available, and contain great skincare ingredients, such as niacinimide, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides ([which may be beneficial for eczema in some people](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18306855)). It is recommended that you spot test CeraVe products if you are acne-prone.\n\n* UK OPTION. [Hydraluron Moisture Booster](http://www.boots.com/en/Hydraluron-Moisture-Booster-From-Indeed-Labs-the-people-who-brought-you-Nanoblur_1262210/) is available from Boots and may be a great choice for people who are not sensitive to algae ingredients and just want a basic, no-frills HA product they can buy from a brick-and-mortar store. I've never used it personally, but it does seem to get rave reviews from people who use it.\n\n[Squalene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squalene) is a natural, organic compound that is usually derived from olives. It's close sister, squalane, is a hydrogenated derivative that has longer shelf life, but she has a lower cost and is therefore more profitable in cosmetic applications. People who have a sensitivity to olives or break out from topical use of olive oil should spot test products with squalene before using. \n\nSome examples of products containing squalene/squalane:\n\n* US OPTION 1. [Solvere](http://www.lovelyskin.com/details.asp?PID=115991&amp;MID=545&amp;PG=1) is a regularly recommended, no-frills moisturizer for those who do well with squalane. \n\n* US OPTION 2/UK OPTION 1. [La Roche-Posay Toleraine Fluid](http://www.dermstore.com/product_Toleriane+Facial+Fluid_677.htm) is a cosmetically elegant, light moisturizer. It applies very light and thin, yet moisturizes beautifully if you have oily or combination skin.\n\n* UK OPTION 2. [Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream](http://www.boots.com/en/Oilatum-Natural-Repair-Face-Cream_9627/) is a fabulous option for UK residents on a tight budget. It is a great little moisturizer that packs quite a punch for roughly £8.\n\nYour success with the various humectants are very individual. Some people prefer hyaluronic acid for their extra moisture while others prefer glycerin. Whatever you choose, keeping extra moisture around will allow your humectants to work to the best of their ability.\n\nThe next thing to consider when aiding dehydrated skin is your product usage. Are you using several topicals that dry or irritate skin? Some examples of irritating ingredients are:\n\n* Salicylic acid\n* Benzoyl peroxide\n* Tea tree oil\n* Topical acne medications (Rx treatments, such as Aczone, Retin-a, Retin-a Micro, Differin, and Tazorac)\n* Sulfur topicals (such as Murad's spot treatment [3%], De la Cruz Sulfur Ointment [10%], and Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask)\n\nIf you're not using any of these ingredients but feel your skin is dehydrated, make sure you're not using a cleanser that strips the skin and makes it feel dry and tight after cleansing (prior to applying moisturizer). *Your skin should never feel this way after cleansing, it is a sign of a damaged skin barrier.* It should feel pleasantly fresh, not squeaky clean. Some common cleansing ingredients and products that cause dry skin in many (but not all) people:\n\n* African black soap\n* Plain ol' bar soap\n* Dr Bronner's soap\n* Acne cleansers, such as Neutrogena's Deep Clean Facial Cleanser or orange bar\n* Cleansers with SLS or SLES, such as Purpose\n* Drying clay masks used too frequently (such as Aztec Secret Indian Clay Mask)\n\nIf you're using an irritating non-RX product, it is advised that you use only one at a time and only once skin is healed and can tolerate it. Even anti-acne products can cause acne if they are irritating the skin and disrupting the skin barrier. Please allow at least one week for your skin to heal if you feel you've overdone it (bland moisturizer, bland cleanser, sunscreen).\n\nIf it's an RX product you're using, please contact your doctor for advice.\n\nFor those of you using a harsh cleanser (*glare*) or one that makes you feel dry and tight after use, I highly recommend you shelve it and try a gentle, non-sudsing cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. This will cleanse the skin without stripping it of its much-needed moisture.\n\nThe most important thing with skincare is listening to your skin and working with it rather than fighting against it's nature. When skin is dehydrated and breaking out, you must treat the disease, not just the symptom. Once you have established a high-moisture, gentle regimen, and your skin has had time to heal (1-2 weeks), you may gradually begin to re-introduce potential irritants such as benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil.\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful and answers questions I see many of you posing every day. Please feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to answer them!\n",

They just suck up moisture, so they are great if you live somewhere where the air is fairly humid, because then they just trap the moisture around your face.

I've seen a lot of people really worried about keloids when in reality they are piercing bumps, and as someone who actually got one of this annoying suckers from a piercing, I'm here to show you what an ACTUAL keloid looks like on its early stages so you can hopefully put your mind at ease :)\n\nFirst, they don't just appear like big bumps. Most of the time the skin just raises in an kind of weird almost unnoticeable way until you notice that hard scar tissue around your ear has raised in a bump that in my experience, is kind of \"plain\" on the upper part, yikes. If you wake up one day with a bump on your ear, **trust me, its not a keloid.**\n\nSecond, its scar tissue, its not full of anything. If your bump is really red full with blood, pus, or anything else, **trust me, its not a keloid.**\n\nThird, they ITCH, for some reason they can be very itchy, and they also grow over time and *they don't shrink, AT ALL,* that's very important. If your bump ever shrinks or you notice it gets better, **trust me, its not a keloid.**\n\nLastly, they don't appear on early stages of a piercing, because its scar tissue overgrowing due to overproduce of collagen and your body doesn't know when to stop. Mine appeared a year and a month after I got my piercing. So if you have a bump in your recent 1 or 2 week piercing, **trust me, its not a keloid.**\n\nLastly, if you still think you have a keloid please visit a dermatologist ASAP and start treatment, unfortunately this things really grow overtime and as I said they don't go down, so the longer your postpone treatment the more difficult it will be to treat it. DON´T TRY ANY HOME REMEDIES LIKE TEA TREE OIL OR ELSE, THAT WILL ONLY IRRITATE IT, and will not help. Trust me, really.\n\nAlso I have some bad news for the people that love at home piercings or visit sketchy places. Although a lot of the factors that have a say on the possibility of getting a keloid are genetic (someone could do everything right and still get one) **bad care and bad piercing procedure could also raise the chances that someone gets a keloid.** That was my case and I have a long horrible story on this piercing (I could make another blogpost about that if someone is interested).\n\nSo take care of your piercings, visit only safe reputable piercings, pay attention to your family keloid history and if you check all this boxes, **it really probably isn't a keloid.**\n\nAnyways, I hope I helped some of you, take care and enjoy safe piercing!",

    "body": "Long post ahead! OG customer here since the brand launched in 2014. Glossier was my introduction to skincare and I do still enjoy many of their products, but I've learned there are so many affordable brands with similar or better formulations. I'm sharing mini reviews of everything I've tried from the brand plus alternatives. Hopefully this will help someone make better spending decisions for Black Friday. :) Feel free to ask any questions!\n\nMy skin type: Normal-ish (hovers between slightly dry to slightly oily)\n\n**SKINCARE**\n\n* Milky Jelly Cleanser - My favorite Glossier product hands down, so moisturizing and gentle! I've used this since launch and haven't looked back.\n   * Alternative: Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser is a great substitute with a much better price point. It's thinner in texture, but equally gentle and moisturizing.\n* Balm Dotcom - I've tried Coconut, Rose, Mint, Mango and Birthday. Flavors are fun but none of them blew me away. Moisturizing effects are mediocre.\n   * Alternative: Lanolips 101 Ointment is similar in pricing but much more effective on very dry lips and cuticles.\n* Priming Moisturizer - I enjoyed using this lightweight moisturizer for a couple years but stopped when I started using tretinoin, as this product also contains retinyl palmitate (Vitamin A).\n   * Alternative: Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion is slightly thinner in texture, but very similar in moisturizing effects with a better price.\n* Priming Moisturizer Rich - I really like how luxurious this feels, I just wish it didn't contain the lavender fragrance. This is amazing in the winter but a little too heavy in the warmer months.\n   * Alternative: Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream is equally comforting but slightly more affordable and has better ingredients for calming and soothing. I enjoy using this one year round.\n* Priming Moisturizer Balance - Not a big fan of this. It doesn't feel very hydrating, and tends to pill under my sunscreens/base makeup.\n   * Alternative: Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion again. It's very lightweight and absorbs quickly even for oily skin.\n* Super Serums - These are severely overpriced, weak formulas even in the new larger size. The ingredient list is fine for sensitive skin, but I hardly got any benefits out of them.\n   * Alternatives for Super Glow: Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Drop, or any from The Ordinary\n   * Alternative for Super Bounce: Hada Labo Gokyujun lotion is more effective, and you get a huge bottle for a fraction of the price.\n   * Alternative for Super Pure: I haven't sought alternatives since I already get niacinamide in my Curology prescription. I've heard good things about The Ordinary's Niacinamide Serum though.\n* Bubblewrap - I really enjoy the texture of this cream, but it's a little overpriced. It moisturizes but doesn't help with dark circles.\n   * Alternative: Freck Beauty So Jelly Eye Jelly is equally moisturizing and you get almost 3x the product for a similar price! This is a hidden gem that people are really sleeping on.\n* Moisturizing Moon Mask - Decently moisturizing when my skin is in good health, but stings a lot when my skin is sensitive.\n   * Alternative: I'm from Honey Mask is more expensive per oz, but the ingredients are so much more effective. So gentle and softening. It's also a lot thicker so I get more uses out of it.\n* Mega Greens Galaxy Pack - This is the more gentle mud mask I've ever tried (not drying at all), but it's not a must-have.\n   * Alternative: I don't have a good alternative for this, sorry! My skin prefers BHA exfoliation to deal with clogged pores.\n* Invisible Shield - I love the texture of this SPF but it's incredibly expensive for such a small bottle.\n   * Alternatives: Purito Centella Unscented Sun (my current favorite) and Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence are great affordable options that don't leave a white cast.\n* Zit Stick - I really dislike the packaging and barely get any use out of this. Honestly feels like a basic spot treatment.\n   * Alternative: The Body Shop's tea tree oil is more effective for me and much more affordable.\n\n**MAKEUP**\n\n* Perfecting Skin Tint - I know a lot of people find this product too sheer and pointless, but I love how sheer it is. It evens out my skin tone without making my hyperpigmentation/melasma look grey, which a lot of foundations do.\n   * Alternative: Mixing L'Oreal Infallible 24H Fresh Wear with some facial oil gives a similar dewy vibe.\n* Stretch Concealer - My HG undereye concealer. I like to swipe on a thick layer and leave it let it to set for a few minutes before blending. This method gives me great coverage with the dew! You can also apply this as a foundation with a small fluffy brush. I've received many compliments about how smooth my skin looks with this on, plus Wowder over it.\n   * Alternative: Maybelline Fit Me is a good hydrating option, but it's much higher coverage and I have a better shade match with Glossier.\n* Cloud Paint - A little product goes a long way, so this is actually great value. My favorite colors are Dusk and Dawn. However, it does lift my concealer so I recommend applying this very very gently if you're concealing any pigmentation on your cheeks. I personally prefer stiffer cream blushes that come in a pan/stick, as they don't disturb my base makeup as much.\n   * I don't have formula dupes but several close color dupes. I'll save these for another post as I have tons of cream blush to swatch!\n* Futuredew - I dabble between this and the Perfecting Skin Tint (they pretty much give the same dewy appearance) but this is much heavier. I only prefer this in very, very cold and dry conditions. In most months, it gets a bit too shiny on top of my skincare and sunscreen.\n   * Alternative: Any rich moisturizer/facial oil\n* Haloscope - Pretty overrated in my opinion. It swatches pretty on my hand, but I can hardly see it on my face especially if I've used a dewy base like Perfecting Skin Tint or Futuredew. I'm also not a fan of how tacky it feels on the skin.\n   * Alternative: Colourpop Super Shock Highlighters come in more shades, various levels of intensity, and are super affordable in contrast.\n* Wowder - I love this, it leaves my skin with a satin finish! It extends the longevity of the dewy base products but not super longwear by any means.\n   * Alternative: None yet\n* Boy Brow - I used to swear by this but sometimes it makes my brow hairs look too wet for my taste. I have very straight and thick eyebrow hairs, and the formula can be easy to overapply.\n   * Alternative: Em Cosmetics Brow Cream is a drier formula and looks more matte, fluffy and subtle. I much prefer the precise brush on this one too.\n* Brow Flick - Does not apply well if you have any lotion/skin tint on your skin. The pen dried up after a couple uses too. Too finnicky to mess with, I prefer pencils.\n   * No alternatives, I just don't like brow tint pens.\n* Lash Slick - Straightens out my lashes big time (even when I use heavy duty lash fixers for Asian lashes). Kind of a pain to remove even with warm water.\n   * Alternative: Maybelline Full n' Soft is my favorite natural looking mascara of all time, but it's not a tubing mascara and smudges a little sometimes.\n* Generation G - I've tried all the colors but Jam. The only one I would repurchase is Cake. The formula is easy to work with, but the darker colors tend to emphasize lip lines.\n   * Alternative: Colourpop Ultra Blotted Lip gives a very similar look, but has a blurring quality that is flattering even on dry lips.\n* Lip Gloss - The clear gloss is the bomb. I even prefer this over the Laneige Sleeping Lip Mask for deep moisturization. The red and holographic ones are pretty, but not as versatile.\n   * Alternative: None yet\n* Skywash - I actually really like these and posted a rainbow eye look here awhile ago. They are super easy to blend on my skin tone (G9), but I can't fully recommend them at regular price.\n   * Alternative: None yet\n\n**My personal top picks:** Milky Jelly Cleanser, Stretch Concealer, Wowder, Lip Gloss",
