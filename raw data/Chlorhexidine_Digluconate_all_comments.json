One of the main points of mango butter is that it has skin soothing/healing properties, but it's not greasy. Honey is very good for skin because of its sugars and antioxidant value. Also, a few studies show that it can be healing for wounds. Royal Jelly, however, does not have any evidence of helping skin a whole lot.*\n\n*Potentially problematic ingredients: The oils in this are great, but the high % olive oil may be bothersome to acne-prone skin types. YMMV.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I couldn't fit more pictures in this post, but the reviews say this is a light gel cream type that absorbs very fast.](https://preview.redd.it/fnpdk02yzl731.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bd89c8b5ffb3adb0019df2bb8a49bfb8f1209a7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm sorry to keep having to make separate posts and spamming everyone.

    "body": "**Age-** 27 y/o Female\n\n**Skin type**\\- Combination. T zone is extremely oily during humid weather. Cheeks are dry/normal. Wheatish skin.\n\nClimate- Continental. Currently hot and humid.\n\n**Reviews-**\n\nHello everyone. I have been planning on doing this comparative review for a really long time but was too lazy to write it all. Finally got the mental energy to sit and write it down.\n\nPlease do note that I tested these sunscreens in different seasons. I have used all of them for more than a month, though for some, the use has not been very regular because of the lockdown. Kindly factor that in however you may want to.**The review is strictly based on my personal experience- so ymmv, will differ for different people. Please do take it with a pinch of salt.**\n\n**1. Neutrogena Ultra sheer dry touch sunblock SPF 50**\\- This is the sunscreen I have used the longest amount of time for. Very budget friendly. Provides adequate protection. However earlier when I was not aware of the three finger rule, I would use the same quantity as I would with a moisturiser- it suited me and gave me a matte finish. However, when I began using the required amount, it dried my skin. Every time.  I no longer use it now. The consistency is a like a cream but it blends okay.Also since it is a chemical sunscreen, I have not faced any white cast issue with this.\n\nIngredients-[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Homosalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/homosalate), [Benzophenone-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/benzophenone-3), [Ethylhexyl Salicylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-salicylate), [Octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), [Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), [Silica](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/silica), [Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/styrene-acrylates-copolymer), [Potassium Cetyl Phosphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-cetyl-phosphate), [Beeswax](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Caprylyl Methicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-methicone), [Cetyl Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-dimethicone), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Sodium Polyacrylate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-polyacrylate), [Behenyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behenyl-alcohol), [Xanthan Gum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xanthan-gum), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Acrylates/​C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c12-22-alkyl-methacrylate-copolymer), [Dimethicone/​PEG-10/​15 Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-peg-10-15-crosspolymer), [Ethylhexyl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-stearate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [BHT](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Chlorhexidine Digluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorhexidine-digluconate), [Ethylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylparaben), [Trideceth-6](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/trideceth-6), [Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diethylhexyl-2-6-naphthalate)\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 650 for 88ml. easily available on e commerce sites like Nykaa, Amazon etc.\n\n**2. Innisfree Daily Mild Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++-** I got this last year during lockdown because this is the only budget friendly Korean sunscreen I knew of then. Really light lotion like texture and sits well on the face without piling. Gives a semi-dewy finish. However felt a little greasy on my face during humid season. Did it protect me adequately? I actually do not know because I wore it outside only a few times. I did not tan but the exposure to sun was not a lot so cannot be sure. Has a nice fragrance but when has that protected us from…anything. It has atleast three sunscreen filters and percentage is mentioned. But I am not sure if they are sufficient? No white cast with this either. I enjoyed using it except for the greasiness (which is not much but can still be felt).\n\n**Ingredients**\\-Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate 3.5%, Ethylhexyl Triazone 3.0%, Methylpropanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine 2.5%, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C20-22 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tromethamine, Fragrance, Carbomer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Fructooligosaccharides, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pullulan, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Tocopherol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, C14-22 Alcohols, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Glucoside, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\n**Price and availability**\\- Rs 700 for 50ml. Usually on discount so can be bought for around Rs 500 too. Can be purchased from Nykaa, Boddess, Amazon etc.\n\n**3. The Blessing Tree Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++-** Currently my HG. I have worn it a lot. Provides adequate protection. Has a lotion like texture but is thicker than the Innisfree one. Provides a demi matte finish. Does not feel greasy to me. Has a weird smell but that’s okay. It does not bother me much. Since it is a hybrid sunscreen, it does give a tiny amount, almost negligible white cast which settles down fast too. **WRP.**\n\n**Ingredients-** Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide Lotion\n\nInactive Ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume\n\n**Price and Availability**\\- Rs 249 for 100ml on Amazon.\n\n**4. Lóreal Paris Aqua Essence UV Perfect Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++-**  Can't speak enough about its amazing consistency and texture. So light and absorbs easily. Haven’t had the opportunity to wear it often since I bought it this year. The first time I wore it, it stung my eyes. The next time it did not sting my eyes but felt greasy because the weather was humid. I dont think the sunscreen is to be blamed for that. It’s major con (and everyone knows that) is the quantity for the price it is sold. No white cast. Might think of repurchasing but not sure about it.\n\nIngredients- Aqua, Alcohol Denat, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Isopropyl Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Tocophérol Acétate, Phenoxyethanol, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, PEG-8 Laurate, Palmitic Acid, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide/​Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Linalool, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Geraniol, Disodium EDTA, Ceteth-10, Potassium Hydroxide, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum/​Fragrance (F.I.L. C161957/​2)\n\n**Price and Availability-** Rs 515 for 30ml. Usually available on a discounted price of 400 something on Nykaa.\n\nVerdict- I will continue purchasing The Blessing Tree sunscreen. This sub introduced me to this budget friendly option and I am so grateful! The other sunscreens mentioned here are also good, never broke me out (my skin is not sensitive so maybe that’s why) so it totally depends on what you are looking for. I am anticipating queries about Oxybenzone and Co ‘s safety- please do read up on it. They are safe. The only issue with older chemical sunscreen filters is their instability. The newer ones are more stable so I’d definitely explore some of the newer filters in the future. **Other than that- it is more important to wear sunscreen, even if it offers very basic protection than to not wear sunscreen at all.** I hope this review will be helpful! Please ask away anything you would like to in the comments. I will try my best to answer them. (I will also post this under the sunscreen thread).",

Since curly hair is perpetually moisture-starved, I got this leave-in a few weeks after it came out.\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nWater, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Cetyl Esters, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-6, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Limonene, Isopropyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Cetrimonium Chloride, Coumarin, Parfum/​Fragrance\n\n**Initial Uses:**\n\nFor the first 3 times I used this, I did as they recommended, i.e. applied it on clean, dry hair at night. It feels a little sticky to touch after application, but that goes away by the morning. After the first use, I did not rinse it off the next morning. It hydrated my hair *very,* my hair was extremely soft. However the amodimethicone in it made my hair kind off frizzy and difficult to manage. For the next 2 washes, I decided to rinse it off in the morning without any shampoo. That ended up working better for me.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. Intensely hydrates.\n2. Has some slip, you could potentially use it as a styling product if you have fine or wavy hair that doesn't like heavy products.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. It has fragrance. Heavy fragrance. *Almost-gave-me-a-headache* fragrance. C*ould-probably-be-used-as-a-perfume-if-you-tried-hard-enough* fragrance.\n\n**How I use it now:**\n\n1. I apply it on wash days as pre-poo. I leave it on for an hour and then wash off.\n2. Also I accidentally spilled some on my forearm once, and turns out it works fine as a lotion lol. So now sometimes I just put some on my arms if they're feeling extra dry. Probably a waste of product to use it like this, but it feels better than just leaving it on the shelf.\n\nAll in all, if you are okay with silicones and fragrance, I would recommend this. However I WNRP myself.",

This pilot study included 40 admitted COVID-19 positive patients (10 in each group). Saliva samples were collected before rinsing and at 30 min, 1, 2 and 3 h after rinsing with: Group 1—0.2% Chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX); Group 2—1.5% Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); Group 3—Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) or Group 4 (control group)—No rinsing. Viral load analysis of saliva samples was assessed by Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR. Mean log10 viral load at different time points was compared to that at baseline in all groups using a random effects linear regression analysis while for comparison between groups linear regression analysis was used. The results showed that all groups had a significantly reduced mean log10 viral load both at 2 (p = 0.036) and 3 (p = 0.041) hours compared to baseline. However, there was no difference in mean log10 viral load between any of the investigated mouthwashes and the control group (non-rinsing) at the evaluated time points. Although a reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the saliva of COVID-19 patients was observed after rinsing with mouthwashes containing 0.2% CHX, 1.5% H2O2, or CPC, the reduction detected was similar to that achieved by the control group at the investigated time points. The findings of this study may suggest that the mechanical action of rinsing/spitting results in reduction of SARS-CoV-2 salivary load.\n\nEdit: sorry for adding the saline rinses to the title — they didn’t test that here, but it is included in the discussion with other comparative studies, and it was the last thing I read so I think it just pulled it in!",

This doesn’t directly address the common-in-ZC-circles practice of prophylactic use shortly after exposure. It’s conceivable that a virucidal wash could have enhanced effectiveness here for one reason or another – purely, um, spitballing, inactivating a virus that replicates versus in part moving it around the mouth where it can infect cells – if it touches it, it’s dead. But again, we know that mechanical removal by flushing with water is best practice for preventing (usually bacterial) infection with wounds – but on the other hand we ideally use soap with that and who tf is gargling soap. \n\n– I’m not entirely against mouthwashes and nasal sprays and can imagine ways they could work prophylactically, I would have to know way more about the exact kinetics of a COVID infection versus the body to speak confidently, but I’m skeptical of stuff at the most exterior level of the body preventing something that’s in the air and winds up in your lungs… it would have to like, be kept out of the lower respiratory tract by structural and immune factors until it overcomes the immune system in the upper respiratory tract. Does that happen? Idk. But regardless I would strongly encourage no one to take a false sense of security with these things or to put much stock in the largely manufacturer-run, poorly designed studies about them.\n\nFwiw, in theory I use CPC mouthwash anyway for gingivitis, but I often slip and don’t do it.

    "body": "About my hair- 2a/2b dry coarse low porosity hair which is a little longer than my waist.\nI have always had a tough time finding a conditioner / mask , any mask loaded with silicones make my hair not clump to form waves and puff out. Matrix hydrasource mask was the only thing that has even come close to my hg but unfortunately they stopped selling the mask on retail basis and it is intended only for saloon purpose and with the pandemic I don't think I will be stepping into a salon anytime soon. So I was looking for an affordable alternative and someone in this sub mentioned this one. Now the coming to ingredients \n\nMatrix biolage hydrasource mask- \nAqua , Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, stearyl alcohol,Cetyl Esters, fragrance,  Phenoxyethanol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis / Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride , sodium citrate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Linalool, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxycitronellal, Amyl Cinnamal. \n\n Loreal total repair 5 masque - \nWater, cetearyl alcohol, mineral oil, dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylmonium methosulphate, cetyl esters, lactic acid, phenoxyethanol , trideceth-6 , chlorhexidine digluconate, limonene, benzyl salicylate, amodimethacone, 2-oleamido-1,3-octadecanediol, fragrance,cetrimonium chloride, butylphenyl methylpropional , Hexyl cinnamal.(they have reformulated since the last time I used it about 2 years ago)\n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\n     Now coming to texture , the loreal one is tad bit thicker than the matrix mask and the slip provided is also lesser than the matrix mask. So I needed about 1.5 times  the amount as matrix one . The shine provided by both are same .They both act similarly when it come to making my waves form and hold. The loreal one is not as moisturising as the Matrix mask , and the frizz is also a little more than matrix mask.  So overall I would say  loreal total repair mask comes close to matrix by about 85%  . And it is costlier than the matrix biolage hydrasource mask, so I will again start my search once this one gets over.",

Is there anything else you would recommend for us ?\n\nAlso if we understood well we should bring back the penis in?

    "body": "So I’ve actually been only shampooing my hair with a sulfate-free shampoo for quite a while without using a conditioner, and just applying argan oil after. I wash my hair in the morning so I don’t really have time to do a two-step routine for my hair, or I’m really too lazy for it. Also I feel like manipulating my hair twice in the shower ends up with more hair on my drainage cap.\n\nBut the thing is I feel like my hair has been breaking and falling quite a bit, which I think is because it’s too dry and not properly conditioned. So I’m actually considering co-washing instead. \n\nI’ve had these two conditioners in my closet for a while that I have not used, and I’ve looked through the ingredients list, would they be ok to use for co-washing?\n\n**[Redken Frizz Dismiss Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/Redken-Dismiss-Conditioner-protection-smoothing/dp/B00UJZRO50)**\n\n> Aqua / Water / Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Paraffinum Liquidum / Mineral Oil / Huile Minerale, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Parfum / Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, PEG / PPG / Polybutylene Glycol-8 / 5 / 3 Glycerin, Pentaclethra Macroloba Oil / Pentaclethra Macroloba Seed Oil, Hexyl Cinnamal, BHT, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n\n\nThis one looks quite fine to me? It seems to be a silicone-free conditioner and I read that Behentrimonium Chloride is quite good to have in a hair cleanser and it doesn’t seem to have any problematic ingredients in the top five.\n\n**[Klorane Conditioner with Pomegranate ](https://www.amazon.com/Klorane-Conditioner-Pomegranate-5-1-fl/dp/B000Q34W0K)**\n\n> Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Alcohol, Ceteareth-33, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Isopropyl Alcohol, Methyparaben, Punica Granatum extract, Red 4 (CI 14700), Trideceth-12\n\n\nIt seems the only problem for this one could be the Amodimethicone? Which I gather from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/?st=JGTIBFB0&sh=8c65316e) that it can be hard to wash off but does not cause a build up. I have briefly looked up the rest of the ingredients and they don’t seem to have serious red flags (except maybe the parabens). Is it still ok to use for cowash?\n\nI plan to shampoo with a sulfate-free shampoo once a week.",

It's marketed for dry and atopy prone skin for both babies and adults. It costs around 6$ for 400ml. Now, my skin is normal leaning to oily but dehydrated a good bit, handles actives really well and I get maybe a couple pimples in a month, so not overly problematic. \n\n\nI'm currently in the market for a nice rich (preferably cheap) moisturizer for my PM routine and I bought this one based on the ingredients and the price, primarily for my month old big leg tattoo but it seems to me there shouldn't be any issues using it on my face as well. I put it on last night after cleansing and a HA face mist and this morning my face felt nice and nourished, no breakouts or whiteheads.\n\n\nSo my question is, what do you think about its ingredients? Do you think it could be harmful to consistently use it in on my face in the PM routine? Here's the ingredients list:\n\n\n**AQUA / WATER • GLYCERIN • PETROLATUM • PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM / MINERAL OIL • NIACINAMIDE • GLYCERYL STEARATE • CETYL ALCOHOL • PEG-40 STEARATE • BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER • CETYL PALMITATE • DIMETHICONE • ASCORBYL PALMITATE • CHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE • CITRIC ACID • CORIANDRUM SATIVUM SEED OIL / CORIANDER SEED OIL • ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM SEED OIL • GLYCINE SOJA OIL / SOYBEAN OIL • PANTHENOL • PRUNUS ARMENIACA KERNEL OIL / APRICOT KERNEL OIL • RIBES NIGRUM SEED OIL / BLACK CURRANT SEED OIL • SORBITAN TRISTEARATE • TOCOPHEROL (F.I.L.

This treatment is only designed to last 6ish weeks, and is not a permanent long term fix.\nAlmost all products sold as a split end “repair” treatment will not actually repair the split ends. They’re most likely smoothing the hair shaft to give the appearance of less split ends, and it washes out when you wash your hair. The emollients concentration in these products is heavy, so they can be very challenging to people with oily hair, because you are essentially adding more oil to the hair.

(When I scheduled a grooming appointment for later this week, they told me it would take them 5 hours, as a team of 2, to de-mat him, so this really isn't possible.)\n\n\\- If I just give him a thorough shampoo and condition, and do a little bit of combing, am I going to destroy his coat past the point of saving it, so that I'll need to shave him after?\n\nI would love to take him to a groomer to do the giardia shampoo and the full comb-through, but can't so as to avoid infecting other dogs.\n\nMy vet isn't familiar with samoyed grooming needs so any input you can share from previous experiences would be so appreciated!",

The T-rake would go through her pretty easy with the detangling shampoo in. Granted, she wasn’t heavily matted.  I would then towel dry, then blow dry her (using a flying pig dog blow dryer) while brushing her with the t-rake and slicker brushes to get the rest of the matting out.\n\nI’m no expert, my girls only 9 months now, but if you can’t get the mats out, I would think as long as you can soak him well enough and then shampoo him and really work it in and let it sit for 10 mins or so, it seems like you would be good.  But definitely get some detangling conditioner if you don’t have any as it helps tremendously (and smells good).\n\nI would be curious to hear other’s opinions on just bathing first and brushing the coat out while it’s wet with the conditioner in.  It did seem to work for me, but again my girls mats were not terrible to start.  Oh, one more thing, don’t try to get all the mats in one day.  You’ll both be miserable.  When I find them I just focus on one area that day and if there are others I try to remember the next day.  That’s why I think you’d be better just bathing him to address the giardia sooner than later.  Hopefully others with more grooming experience chime in.",

Iirc polyquats are even more difficult to remove than amodimethicone, but why bother? These ingredients impart shine and smoothness and are somewhat protective (among other things). Your hair does not contain living cells and does not require nutrients to be delivered into the inner core, nor does it require water inside the hair shaft. In fact, from my research less water in the hair shaft is ideal. So a layer of emollients will do more good than harm imo.\n\n\nObviously buildup will occur after some time, and when this occurs you can always use a clarifying shampoo. I was strictly no sulfates/silicones for a few years for my curly hair. Nowadays knowing the science behind things, I don't understand the movement.",

My shampoo has that same cleanser, and some people describe it as essentially a sulfate while others say it's the most stripping of the non-sulfates but still weaker. If it were me, I would go by how my hair feels. If your hair seems gunky, sticky, or like it won't detangle the way it normally would, you can throw in a suave daily clarifying wash. If not, maybe your hair just likes being coated in silicone (or the shampoo is cleaning adequately) and you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to watch out for is that those heavy silicones tend to prevent oils from getting to your hair, so if you feel like your hair is really dry, or like the texture of it when unconditioned is getting worse, that may be a sign to switch conditioners or at least do a sulfate wash and use a silicone-free deep conditioner before you resume using the amodimethicone one.",

Though sometimes they wouldn't have done that because some ingredients by default can do that but the company didn't put much focus on this effect.

Encapsulation means there’s a particle around a core of the active - eg silicone NPs, chitosan, silica, or a liposome. Liposomal delivery (like our COVID-19 vaccines) is a form of encapsulation.\n\nRegarding your main concern: I don’t think you’ll be able to guess its level of percutaneous absoprtion or biodisponibility just by its classification. \n\nIf you have penetration enhancers (denatured alcohols), this will affect how deep topicals get into the skin. Surfactants will also play a role in drug release on the skin. So these are extrinsic variables.\n\nParticle size, charge/zeta potential, aggregation etc will also play a role in skin distribution and drug release - even with the exact same delivery system.

I didn't use the conditioner since it had wheat protein in it (I'm celiac and I try to avoid putting gluten on my hands, even if it's microscopic), but my friend said she hated the conditioner. (She has curly/kinky hair.) I warned her to be careful if it got on her scalp since AHAs increase photosensitivity. (There was no warning about this on the bottle -- perhaps there's too little % in there?)\n\nAnyone know why L'oreal would bother putting lactic acid in a conditioner? What can AHAs do for hair? Or ceramides, for that matter? I assumed that this was an attempt to capture what's popular in skincare these days, but I knew I had to ask you guys!\n\n**The copy on the bottle reads:** The new Total Repair Extreme collection contains powerful ceramide to help repair broken hair fibers**. This luxurious formula instantly penetrates into the fiber to deeply renew extremely damaged and over-processed hair.\n\nI found this rather vague, even given the standards of beauty copywriting, but maybe I don't read enough shampoo bottles.\n\n**The full ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Behentrimonium Chloride, Parfum/ Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glycerin, Lactic Acid, Arginine, Glutamic Acid, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Serine, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Amyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, 2-oleamido- 1,3-octadecanediol, Alpha-isomethyl Ionone.\n\nAny insight?

I don't think that lactic acid would repair hair, and I think the ceramide would just \"glue\" the split end temporarily back together making it appear less frayed. The lactic acid might be beneficial for exfoliating the scalp, but since AHAs are typically used for skin issues such as acne and closed comedones that don't typically appear on the scalp it seems like it's just a marketing gimmick to me.",

Only two episodes of fever and loss of taste and smell. But the main purpose of this post is that I’ve tried something that possibly was the responsible for getting my taste and smell back.\n\nSo here it goes, after a week without taste and smell I started to gargle with anti bacterial mouthwash named Eludril Classic which is a combination of 2 ingredients; antibacterial Chlorhexidine digluconate (0.1%) and Chlorobutanol (0.5%) 3x times a day and also Strepsils which is also a antibacterial and antiseptic \nin form of pills to suck which contains a combination of two effective antiseptic ingredients: 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol and 1.2mg amylmetacresol.\n\n\nI’m mentioning the composition because I don’t know if this products with this name exists on your country. Here in Portugal and at least in Europe I think they exist under this name. After two days my taste and smell started to get back to normal, worked with me and with a friend of mine.\n\nI can also recommend gargle in between with warm salt water. When you gargle make sure that the liquid touches your throat.\n\nI hope this can help someone else.\n\nStay strong my friends!",

He didn't mention liquen planus and just told me that the mouth in and teeth in general is dirty and that I need to clean it, so I appointed a cleaning session, he also told me to use a tongue brush and a mouthwash, the mouthwash is called Halita mouthwash and has the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Chlorhexidine digluconate 0,05%**    \nWorks  effectively by preventing the formation of oral biofilm and acts in  synergy with CPC, helping to neutralise malodorous gases.  \n>  \n>**Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)**  **0,05%**  \nReduces the build-up of oral biofilm.  \n>  \n>**Zinc lactate**   \nDeactivates malodorous gases, ensuring that they do not emanate or produce negative effects in the oral cavity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will use the mouthwash but im worried about the brush because i've heard that if the white lines become red it can become cancerous so if I use this, it would be like scrapping off scar or something?\n\nIm just very worried, this guy didn't warm me about this. Now I don't know how to go about it. I have uploaded a bunch of pictures from different days here.

As you can see the first days I had the itchy red tip of the tongue,  then it formed the sort of white lines thing.  On  2021/11/01 as you can see it looked pretty clear.  Then a couple of days ago it started again. The tongue has been white for a long time but I delayed going to the dentist, I was just supposing this would clear easily with some mouthwash for candiasis or whatever it was. But then the white and red spots started and now im so scared this can get worse. What do I do? Im scared to make it worse by brushing it off.\n\nWhat sort of doctor do I need to visit? I think dentists may not be experts on this and I need an inmunologist or something. I will try the mouthwash and hope it gets better but im so scared. I take thyroid medication and I wonder if it's related, some autoinmunity. Im from Barcelona please recommend me the best doctors for this. Im scared please help.",

Any other ingredients are (mostly) to make a good story without having too much of an impact on how it actually works. \n\nGlycerin and butylene glycol are humectants that will help hold moisture in the mid-layers of the skin. \n\nSodium silicate, sodium magnesium fluorosilicate, and magnesium aluminium silicate are typically added as texturizers and can help create a powdery sensation upon drying.\n\nDipeptide-2 and palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 are supposedly the actives that should contribute to de-puffing from the eyes. There's not a lot of support for this, and so the mechanism is not known. \n\nDipeptide-2 consists of the dipeptide tyrosine-valine (NH3-VY-COOH) and palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 is a palmityl group connected to the amino end of the tetrapeptide glycine-arginine (CH3-(CH2)14-CO-NH-GQHR-COOH).\n\nThe rest isn't doing too much as far as being super effective.

The pain has reduced slightly but the area is still sore and the tooth feels delicate when pressed. \n\n\n**Original post**\n[UK] A couple of months ago I made this post; https://www.reddit.com/r/dentistry/comments/fr81nx/_/ \n\nThe shorthand version is that I had gum soreness around my back bottom molar, which commenters said was Pericoronitis and I was advised to use Corsodyl Original. This helped eliminate the pain and soreness after 2-3 days. Here is an image of the [previous issue.](https://imgur.com/a/tY7NGz7)\n\nUnfortunately in the last 3-4 days the soreness has returned and looks to have gotten worse over the last day. I don't have Corsodyl Original and it seems to be out of stock in stores, I do have Corsodyl Daily Mouthwash which also has Chlorhexidine Digluconate, but I don't believe it works the same? I have yet to try warm salt water rinses. \n\nI've uploaded an image [here](https://imgur.com/a/ddAqF3e), any help would be appreciated. Google and other Reddit posts makes it feel like it's an abscess? As there is a sizeable bump that has formed, which wasn't the case last time. The area feels soft to the touch, and is pretty painful. There is a toothache type pain if i rest my teeth together on that side, or if I try to eat on that side which I have been avoided for the past few days.\n\nNot sure why this has happened again as since the first occasion, I have taken up flossing using dental harps alongside my regular brushing twice a day for two minutes and using mouthwash. \n\nI currently cannot see a dentist as they are closed over the weekend but will call up this coming Monday. Unfortunately my regular checkup appointment had to be cancelled due to the pandemic so I could not have this checked up on the previous and less severe occasion. Any help and advice would be really helpful, I am very worried as to what this could mean.",

Dental infections are not to be taken lightly due to the possibility of spreading to other teeth, jaw, and in rare occasions to the brain, spinal cord. If you have swelling of your face make sure to ice it 2x daily and take some ibuprofen as long as you don't have any kidney issues. If the inside of your throat starts to swell go to the ER. Your dentist will give you some antibiotics and take an xray. Sounds like either a root canal or an extraction if the infection is large on the xrays. I would suggest if it's super painful to call other dentists in your area that take your insurance and try to get an appointment with them.",

So...I should have known better...BUT I added multiple products into my routine and now I don't know which one is breaking me out :(\n\nLittle info: I *think* I have combo skin but not totally sure.  My skin is never super dry or super oily.  But very acne prone in my T-zone (and sometimes a little oily) and then sometimes I have dry patches on my cheeks and around my nostrils.\n\nOk, anyway, so these are the products I've recently added:\n\nThe first is **IT Cosmetic's \"Your Skin but Better\" CC cream (SPF 50)**.  I bought this 3 days ago; I have used it 4 times.  I absolutely fell in love with it right away.  Perfect color match, love the coverage, and that it has SPF.\n\n\nHere is the ingredients list:\n\n\n*Water, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Magnesium Sulfate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Laurate, Stearic Acid, Calcium Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium Edta, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Niacinamide, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Cholesterol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Water, Lactobacillus/Honeysuckle Flower/Licorice Root/Morus Alba Root/Pueraria Lobata Root/Schizandra Chinensis Fruit/Scutellaria Baicalensis Root/Sophora Japonica Flower Extract Ferment Filtrate, Perfluorohexane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chrysanthemum Indicum Flower Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Perfluorodecalin, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sprout Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Pentafluoropropane, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Steareth-20, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Colloidal Oatmeal, Hydrolyzed Silk, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Tocopherol, Thiamine Hcl, Riboflavin, Retinyl Palmitate, Pantothenic Acid, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Niacin, Folic Acid, Chrysin, Carnitine Hcl, Biotin, Ascorbic Acid, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Chlorhexidine Digluconate. May Contain: Iron Oxides (Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499).*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next new product is **Jack Black Epic Moisture MP10 Nourishing Oil**  I've used a sample of this twice now.  2 days ago, I used my DE Babyfacial, which I also recently bought but I've used several samples of this before so I know it's not the culprit.  I do know, however, that the DE Marula Oil that they give you with the babyfacial *does* break me out so I didn't use it after the facial, like they suggest.  Instead, I grabbed the Jack Black sample and I loved it so much! It sunk in right away and just felt so good.  I did this at night then went to bed.  I then used it a second time, yesterday, during the day. BTW, yesterday is the day I noticed my break out.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate, Jojoba Esters, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Citrillus Ianatus (Watemelon) Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Prunus Insititia Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Fragrance (Parfum), Ascorbyl Palmitate, Retinyl Palmitate, Schinziophyton Rautanenii (Manketti) Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Citral, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third product I added is **Marc Jacob's Dew Drops Coconut Gel Highlighter**  I've only used this twice.  I wasn't a big fan.  \n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, Mica, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Tromethamine, Parfum/Fragrance, Lecithin, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Dimethiconol, Simethicone, Hexylene Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta, Tocopherol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Diisostearyl Malate, Butylene Glycol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Panthenol, Withania Somnifera Root Extract, Silica, Isostearyl Alcohol, Malic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Tin Oxide, Coumarin, Linalool, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491), Carmine (Ci 75470).*\n\n\n\nSooo, obviously I'm hoping that the MJ Highlighter is the culprit, since it's the most expensive and my least favorite. But, I have a feeling it's one of the first two :(\n\n\nIf you need any additional info, let me know! I'd love to figure out what it is that caused the breakout so I can continue to use the other products that don't break me out.",

For the last 6-7 years (SD since 20 years) I've been using a cream with Ectoin in it for my face -in different countries as well- and it just works without anything else. [Here is the GScholar search for Ectoin](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=ectoin+&btnG=), and before that for like 3-4 years I used Coresatin cream in Turkey, which was already posted long time ago once by someone but doesn't mention the active ingredient is Chlorhexidine digluconate 0.04% as the packaging says. So [here is the GScholar link](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=chlorhexidine+digluconate&oq=chlorhexidine+diglu) for that molecule.\n\nMy SD started periodical, and i managed mostly but not doing anything - moisturizers, very rarely corticosteroids (1-2 a year), but since about 12-13 years it's basically constant if I don't use anything. So sometimes I stop Ectoin cream (stupid I know) but then it takes slightly longer than c-steroids for it to take care of it, like 5-6 days, a week tops from the biggest flare; total red face. \n\nAlso, you can message me if there's anything more you'd like to know.\n\nPs. For scalp I use Vichy Green Selenium one and rarely a Strong selenium one from pharmacy. Short hair helps a lot too.\n\nPs2. As a chemist, I feel obliged to emphasize the rules of the subreddit and say this is my anecdote and I can only hope it works on everyone's condition, but wondering is there anyone else?\n\n*Does anyone 🤦🏻‍♂️",

He didn't mention liquen planus and just told me that the mouth in and teeth in general is dirty and that I need to clean it, just mentioned the generic \"geographical tongue\" thing, so I appointed a cleaning session, he also told me to use a tongue brush and a mouthwash, the mouthwash is called Halita mouthwash and has the following:  \n\n\n>**Chlorhexidine digluconate 0,05%**  \nWorks  effectively by preventing the formation of oral biofilm and acts in synergy with CPC, helping to neutralise malodorous gases.  \n**Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)** **0,05%**  \nReduces the build-up of oral biofilm.  \n**Zinc lactate**  \nDeactivates malodorous gases, ensuring that they do not emanate or produce negative effects in the oral cavity.\n\nI  will use the mouthwash but im worried about the brush because i've heard that if the white lines become red it can become cancerous so if I  use this, it would be like scrapping off scar or something?\n\nIm just very worried, this guy didn't warm me about this. Now I don't know how to go about it. I have uploaded a bunch of pictures from different  days here.

As you can see the first days I had the itchy red tip of the tongue, then it formed the sort of white lines thing. On 2021/11/01 as you can see it looked pretty clear. Then a couple of days ago it started again. The tongue has been white for a long time but I delayed going to the dentist, I was just supposing this would clear easily with some  mouthwash for candiasis or whatever it was. But then the white and red spots started and now im so scared this can get worse. What do I do? Im scared to make it worse by brushing it off.\n\nWhat sort of doctor do I need to visit? I think dentists may not be experts on this and I need an inmunologist or something. I will try the mouthwash and hope it gets better but im so scared. I take thyroid medication and I wonder if it's related, some autoinmunity. Im from Barcelona please recommend me the best doctors for this. Im scared please help.",

Been using it for a few weeks. I take a better look at my teeth today and I am shocked how yellowed they've become. A few of them have gone yellow around the gum and I'm now very concerned they'll stay like this. How could this be? I drink less soda, eat less sugary foods, brush as much as always. It has to be this. I poured it down the drain, won't be using it again. No dentists open right now so is there anything I can do to undo the staining? This really does not sit with me.\n\nAlso why we're here, let's discuss why my gums bleed after brushing. I only use a soft strength brush and don't really go that hard. Yet I still bleed. Can gum strength be influenced by having a cold for example?\n\nThanks in advance.",

    "body": "Hello,  \nI would like some assistance with a dermatological issue.  \n\nAt the beginning of 2024, my father took in a stray dog he had been caring for. She underwent medical tests to ensure she was healthy and was later spayed. While she was still living on the streets, she occasionally developed wounds on her body that healed quickly after being treated. However, some areas where wounds had healed remained without hair.  \n\nOne day, my father decided to bathe her using a shampoo containing Chlorhexidine Digluconate and Ketoconazole to see if those alopecic areas would improve. He bathed her every Sunday for three weeks.  \n\nUnfortunately, after this, her skin condition worsened significantly. Her skin became inflamed, and new wounds developed that would not heal.  \n\nSince there have been some cases of leishmaniasis in our region, I decided to perform a serological test, which came back negative. I also conducted cytology exams.  \n\nI gave Prednisolone for 10 days, which resulted in a slight improvement—some wounds became drier. However, by the sixth day of treatment, her condition seemed to worsen again. Alongside this, I used Enrofloxacin for 20 days, but the wounds showed no improvement at all. In fact, 12 hours after discontinuing Enrofloxacin, the wounds worsened further.  \n\nThe photos I am sharing were taken before starting any treatment. I have not used any therapeutic shampoos, and I specifically instructed my father to stop bathing her. However, against my advice, he bathed her on the sixth day of treatment using the same shampoo.  \n\nI also applied an ointment containing sulfadiazine, gentamicin, urea, sulfanilamide, and vitamin A, but there was no noticeable effect.  \n\nMy next step is to perform a biopsy. However, my father is reluctant to agree to this procedure as he fears the wound might not heal after the sample is collected. Since I live far away and cannot visit regularly, I am unsure when I will be able to take her to the clinic for the procedure.  \n\nI would like to know if anyone has any ideas about what this could be and what I might expect after the biopsy.  \n\nI performed a scraping on a non-lesioned area to check for the presence of demodicosis, and fortunately, I didn’t find anything.\nShe uses Simparic (Sarolaner) monthly to prevent parasites.\n\nOne important detail: the shampoo my father used was expired! It had been opened years ago during the treatment of another one of our animals. I am unsure if the shampoo contributed to this problem or if it is merely a coincidence.\n\nHere is the link with the images.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ZYOoDyY",

I mean how much of those can they actually even stuff in there? It is SO LONG it’s insane. Absolutely insane. I am so sick of returning bs products to the mall. I’m just going to send back all this Sephora shit for real, not only bc it interrupts my Obagi Zo line which is miraculous and actually worthwhile... but also bc they pissed me off when I dropped major cash at the VIB sale and they stuffed all my packages full of every sample I didn’t ask for. Random stuff like bare minerals and all kinds of junk. \n\nI think I’m done with Sephora and all this skincare hype, moving onto dermatologist stuff and sticking with it.

    "body": "This seems like a pretty \"safe\" place to ask for feedback.  I'm sure you know what a poopstorm Facebook can be and I would love some honest and constructive feedback.\n\nHere's the TL/DR up front\n\n* Figures and findings from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210060/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210060/) \\- I have a document with footnotes.\n* There is a growing awareness of the importance of sanitizing what we come into contact with.\n* Despite the prevalence of illness causing germs on phones and keyboards in the workplace, stats show that not many people regularly take time to disinfect them. Nobody wants to be sick and the employer doesn't want to lose productivity.\n* 52% clean their keyboard 1-2x a month. 32% clean phone 1-4x  a month. Even for employees who only do 1,000 kph, that's STILL 1,000 times a day they are coming into contact with infected equipment.\n* 92% of cell phones  and 95% of keyboards were contaminated... with “staphylococci”, but “*S. aureus*, coagulase negative staphylococci, bacilli (88% on keyboards) and micrococci were also present.” \n* Cleaning crews, if they do it at all, do it as an afterthought not as a specialty.\n* To me right now, $40k a year is comfortable (after tax).  \n* Low overhead. General liability insurance, supplies, tax.\n* 50k total firms in my MSA so even if I have 10 clients @ $5k a year or one client at $40k a year (doubtful, but to show scalability), I think I can reach $40-50k in the first year.\n* If I grow to 1% of the market, or 500 companies, I would hire workers  and gross an additional $200k for each 1% of the market.\n\n**Background** \n\nWhile many people are working from home, many are required to work in offices.  This pandemic may last a while longer, but on-site workers encounter a multitude of contaminants on their computers and phones that cause them to need to use sick days and nobody wants that.  It’s the worker’s task to maintain their equipment but, as shown below, most don’t and many cleaning crews don’t either.\n\nA study from the NIH in 2018 compared the results of regular disinfecting on 25 keyboards and 25 cell phones and stated that “52%... treat the keyboard on average 1–2 times a month.” This is attributed to the time it takes to disinfect over 101 keys.  “Spills and food deposits encourage the growth of millions of bacteria.” while “Dust can trap moisture and enable...bacteria that are already on the keyboard to flourish.” \n\nFurther, “Thirty-two per cent of respondents clean their mobile with a frequency of 1–4 times per a month…”  As with cell phones, office phones also are used in close proximity to  the “..face, ears, nose, lips, and hands, which are the most common infection gateways.\" and  “...pathogenic bacteria are present on...40% of mobile phones belonging to patients in a hospital and on approximately 20% of mobile phones belonging to...staff.” \n\nIf hospital staff aren’t immune to bacteria compromised electronics, it makes sense that  non-medical electronics users are also susceptible. Because of the number of people coming into offices there is ample opportunity for cross-contamination which can then be brought into people’s homes and infect other residents. \n\n**Types of contaminants - Staph and Strep and Bacilli, oh  MY!**\n\n92% of cell phones  and 95% of keyboards were contaminated... with “staphylococci”, but “*S. aureus*, coagulase negative staphylococci, bacilli (88% on keyboards) and micrococci were also present.”  Also found on the keyboards is yeast and mold which aggravate allergies in people who suffer from them. “Some bacteria can even be infectious in low doses and survive for hours or days in biofilm.”\n\n**Results of regular disinfecting**\n\nWith disinfection wipes that contain active ingredients such as “chlorhexidine digluconate and triclosan the reduction of contamination to zero was achieved in 60.9% of mobile phones, but only in 16.7% of keyboards.”  This is attributed to the  smaller number of surface areas on a phone versus over 100 separate keys leading to “dust and organic substrate” in between keys that act as a host.  This DOESN’T mean that it isn’t worth it to disinfect a keyboard. Staph, Strep, yeast and molds are eliminated 100% after disinfecting down to 31.8 for Bacillus  Even if only 1,000 keystrokes are made per day, that’s 1,000 times the user comes into contact with these contaminants. Yet 48% of respondents only cleaned their keyboard 1-2x a month (and I suspect most of these rounded-up to look better in the survey).\n\n**Proposal/Costs/Revenue expectation/Market**\n\nI just took an old keyboard out of storage and it was filthy.  Took me an hour and 15 minutes to deep clean and disinfect but looks good as new. I'm thinking it would take less than five minutes for regular disinfecting.  \n\nConsidering the importance of disinfecting in the workplace, would there be a market for cleaning and sanitizing keyboards and phones on a regular basis?  It would be labor intensive, so that would be the bulk of the cost. General liability at $50, over 160 work-hours in a month, is 3.1 cents/hr and supplies (Isopropyl 70% and microfiber towels) being another seven cents per hour.  If I can clean 12 keyboards per hour (leaving aside phones), I can gross 20/hr.  Companies will be assured employees are using clean equipment and employees won’t have the hassle of performing the work.\n\nInstead of 1-2x month, I could offer daily or weekly cleaning for up to 100% of the office staff. Of course, it would be more cost-effective to work at a single company for $40k a year but even if I just have ten clients, that would be $4k per client.  Being more expensive to conduct business than just one client, I’d probably have to add in a surcharge of 20% or so.  Conversely, I can market it as a deduction for a bigger contract.\n\nAccording to Thumbtack ([https://www.thumbtack.com/p/commercial-cleaning-prices](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/commercial-cleaning-prices)), the average hourly rate for office cleaning is $39, so $20/hr seems fair.  Also, I live in a city with over 7200 high-tech firms which account for over 160k jobs.  I assume they would use more expensive equipment so I can adjust for the extra maintenance (mechanical vs standard keyboard). There are over 50,000 total firms so finding 10 clients out of that shouldn’t be too difficult.  ([https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/08-06-2019-high-tech-industry#:\\~:text=There%20are%207%2C201%20high%20tech,industries%20compared%20to%2024.7%25%20overall.)](https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/08-06-2019-high-tech-industry#:~:text=There%20are%207%2C201%20high%20tech,industries%20compared%20to%2024.7%25%20overall.))\n\nThis is just projections for membrane (standard) keyboards, not including phones/mechanical boards and what the heck, I'll even sanitize the mouse for free.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/juzoh4)",

    "body": "\nHello everyone, I'm writing this post to discuss the difficult that I found to search a job in Netherlands. I explain you my situation in details. I'm a 28 guy, I studied in Italy ( Ms.c in molecular biology ) until march 2022 with a thesis topic in Medical Microbiology and then I moved in Rotterdam. I applied for Research technician/ Research assistant position ( especially in Leiden or Amsterdam ) but all the companies, research institutes and hospitals refused my job application because I have no experience or often other candidates matches better with the job requirements, in their opinions. I compared the study program between Italy and Netherlands and I figured out that the Italian students make more exams and theory than the Dutch one. So, I tried to applied for a \"simple\" position to climb in a company's rank and make experience here in Netherlands but the recruiter said \"You're overrated for this position, you've got a Ms.c in biology\". I thought that a recruiter can help me better than the others and I contacted directly the HR or the laboratory manager of some company but the answer were always the same \"we do not have an open position and therefore will not be able to assist you further\" without an advice or tips. It's a terrible loop. They didn't call me even for an interview. I feel discouraged because the desire to start after 7 years of study is immense but nobody give a chance after 1 year from my degree. What a new graduate must do to draw attention? Which positions can I apply? I attached a Fac-simile of my resume and cover letter. I hope that someone could give me a tips to improve the CV / cover letter if is necessary or explain me what should I do for sorted out this problem \n\nPersonal Information  \n\nCitizenship: Italian                                                                       Residence: Rotterdam, Netherlands\nMobile phone: x                                                            Email: x  \n \nProfessional Summary:  My expertise is in Molecular and cellular biology, on topics such as microbiology, mycology, and infectious disease. I have practical skills in bacterial/fungi culture, carry out experiments in the development/ treatments of new drugs, molecular biology techniques ( PCR, multiplex RT-PCR, DNA extraction, SDS, ELISA ) and microbiology technique ( antimicrobial sensitivity techniques, mobility assay, and MALDI-TOF ). Also, I have an intermediate level in Matlab. \n\nEducation: \n\n• Master’s Degree in Biology (majoring in Molecular and cellular biology), from University Federico II, (Naples, Italy. 2019 – March 2022): Final grade: 104/110  Thesis: The glucocorticoid PYED-1 disrupts mature biofilms of Candida spp. and inhibits hyphal development in Candida albicans I tested the activity of the corticosteroid PYED-1 ( derivative of deflazacort, anti-inflammatory agent) against Candida species. It’s still used in the laboratory of Federico II to find new treatments. In addition, I tested the resveratrol's activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and how is able to modulate the susceptibility to the chlorhexidine digluconate ( biocide of Acinetobacter baumannii ).\n• Bachelor’s Degree in General and applied Biology from Università Federico II (Naples, Italy, 2015 – 2019)\n• Internship in the Department of \"Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology\" of Federico II University. My duties was to performed a multiplex Real time-PCR for identify the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC). BCC is a group of closely related species which includes opportunistic pathogens causing chronic respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients, or individuals affected by cystic fibrosis. (Naples, Italy, 09/2018 – 12/2018)\n• High School Diploma from Liceo Scientifico Virgilio (Pozzuoli, Italy, 2010 – 2015)  \n•  Language Skills  Italian: mother tongue                                   English: B2 \n\nCOVER LETTER \n\nDear Miss/Mr, My name is x and I'm a recent graduate in Biology ( Ms.c ) at Federico II University. I chose this faculty because it perfectly matches my most important characteristics: the curiosity that has distinguished me since childhood, my passion for science, and the need to see a purpose in what I dedicate myself to. These same reasons and my fascination for microbiology led me to apply for this job. Thank you for taking the time to review my materials and consider me. I decided to focus my Master’s Degree studies ( Ms.c ) on Molecular and cellular biology which have allowed me to extend my knowledge of the function of biological macromolecules and the cellular processes in which they are involved and a solid theoretical preparation in the following sectors: molecular microbiology, biochemistry, and protein engineering; molecular genetics and advanced molecular biology; genomics and computational biology. My experience to test the antifungal/antibacterial activity of the corticosteroid PYED 11hydroxy16α,17αepoxy3,20dione-- 1 (pregnadiene1) against Candida spp. ( Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida k rusei ) and Staphilococcus aureus responsible for most drugresistant infections has given me a real understanding of the importance of the research. In addition, I studied how the natural monomeric stilbenoid resveratrol (RV) was able to modulate the susc eptibility to the chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and benzalkonium chloride (BZK) biocides in Acinetobacter baumannii. This study analyzed a panel of reference strains and clinical isolates of Gramnegative bacteria, Grampositive bacteria, and yeasts tole rant to one or both biocides. Also, I took several laboratories and groups of researchers where I acquired practical experience in PCR, multiplex RTPCR, DNA extraction, SDS, MALDI TOF, and ELISA. Thanks to my project and my university careers path, I learned a lot about a wide range of topics such as working with bacteria/fungi and finding the right way to treat this terrible disease. I spent 2 years in Federico II hospital for my duties and now I am more determined to do something to contribute in the best way I can. At the Department of Medicine Microbiology, I worked as part of a closeknit team of researchers from different disciplines and nationalities. This increased my confidence in communicating my research to those outside my field and improved my int ercultural skills. Furthermore, I understand the difficult of research work. I can maintain focus on my individual tasks, with full knowledge of how they contribute to the overall research goals, no matter how repetitive my tasks are. Unfortunately from my background, many recruiters think that I have specific skills but my Ms.c has allowed me to deepen various aspects of biology.  Indeed, the practical experience isn't at the level of those who studied here in the Netherlands but with an important theoreti cal background, I'll be able to compensate for this gap. I have not interested in salary or position, what matters to me after 7 years of study is growing up in a company and improving my knowledge/handson under the supervision of other researchers. There fore, the chance to start a new path in Netherlands, where I can face new challenges by having the right tools is exactly what I am looking for. In conclusion, the desire to start is immense and I'm convinced that given the opportunity I would be a nice ad dition to a team and a great funny colleague to work with. I‟ll be more than happy to provide any further information if required. Kind regards",

The products are advertised for dry hair and contain ingredients such as glycerin and sodium hyaluronate, typically used as humectants in skincare.\n\nMy understanding of glycerin and sodium hyaluronate is that they are water-based ingredients, so I was sceptical if this is just marketing and if they'd do anything meaningful or simply be washed out.\n\nThe formula does include silicones, so perhaps the active ingredients could be trapped underneath that, but on the other hand, perhaps the silicones would be stopping them from penetrating the hair? (I'm not sure if the glycerol or hyaluronate are the right molecular size to enter the hair shaft in the first place.)\n\nSuppose they could bypass the cuticle would they provide any benefit?\n\nI've been looking at diagrams of hair anatomy and can't tell if dry healthy hair is meant to contain a certain amount of water. Assuming it is, and that a damaged cuticle leads to a reduction of this as water is escaping, leaving hair feeling \"dry\", would such ingredients be able to increase the water content in hair?\n\nIf so, is there such a thing as too much water, where this could help damaged hair, but make healthy hair limp or fragile? \n\n\"Dry\" hair is fragile too, ie. inflexible and prone to snapping, but it's not clear if increasing water content can alleviate this if oils and silicones haven't been enough.\n\nMy understanding of humectants in skincare is that they work by either drawing in water from the air or pulling it up from the skin surface, but neither of those seem to apply here, so are hair humectants doing anything, particularly when used with silicones? Would it maybe make sense to apply silicones afterwards?\n\nThe hair range also includes a leave-in product with a lot more hyaluronate, and oil instead of silicone, but I don't know about penetration when it comes to applying this on dry hair (presumably on a layer of silicones from the conditioner).\n\nI'd love if someone could weigh in on the science here.\n\n--\n\nList of the ingredients in this range for reference:\n\nShampoo:  \nAQUA / WATER • SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE • GLYCOL DISTEARATE • SODIUM CHLORIDE • COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE • DIMETHICONE • CI 60730 / EXT.

HYA and glycerin won’t remain on your hair when washed out, but in a conditioner, they may linger a bit, as most conditioners leave behind a film by design.  It is good to have humectants in a formulation for many reasons.  But not every ingredient in a formulation is going to perform independently as it would if you were using separately.  In other words, in a formulation it does one thing, while if you were put a HYA serum directly on your hair, it would do something else (or have a different effect rather).  \n\nFwiw, you can always a drop or two of HYA or glycerin to your leave-in conditioner if you want more humectants in your hair.",

        "body": "The relationship between hair and water is complicated.  When most people talk about \"moisturizing\" or \"hydrating\" their hair, they're really talking about the benefits of using conditioner, which mostly forms a coating of conditioning agents on the hair that make it softer and smoother rather than adding water.  It's a mis-application of skincare concepts to hair.  Hair is quite different from skin.  If there's too much water in the hair, it actually feels more dry, which is what the moisture bot that this comment will trigger says.  Porous hair, especially if there is chemical or heat or sun or chlorine damage, will usually allow too much water into the hair shaft, so conditioners offer the benefit of decreasing (but not completely blocking) the amount of water that passes through.\n\nHowever there has been a bit of an overcorrection of this idea in some hair science circles to give the impression that hair doesn't benefit from any water at all, and that's not true either.  [This video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1qFlgNSgLp/) is information-dense and just scratches the surface of the topic, and I wish I had additional resources to share but that's all I've found that's made for a general audience.\n\nIn your situation, your hair feels dry (rough/brittle) to you, so it may actually have too much water in it and would benefit from products with oils, silicones and other polymers that help reduce water passing through.  L'Oreal has a big budget for product development and testing, so I trust that their products are good for the hair type they say they are, but exactly how & why may not match what the label says, that's just marketing that is aimed to appeal to customer's *perceptions*, not reflect scientific reality.  It could be the silicones in the product and other ingredients you're not familiar with that offer a lot of the benefits that the product promises.  You might find some of the [LabMuffin Beauty articles/videos on silicones](https://labmuffin.com/?s=silicones) useful, it's important to understand that they don't create an impermeable barrier on the hair to block anything from getting through.\n\nI share the skepticism of the other commenter that humectants in a shampoo would do much for hair, since it's meant to remove stuff from the hair and then is rinsed out.  Conditioners are formulated to stick to the hair, however it's still very possible that the hyaluronic acid is featured mainly for marketing purposes.  There has been a recent fad in marketing to highlight skincare actives in the products, but hair and skin are very different and those actives don't necessarily behave the same way for hair or help hair at all.  Glycerin may be useful if the product leaves it on the hair, but people's experiences with glycerin in hair products vary wildly, because it depends a lot on your local climate and the humidity level of the air around your hair.  It's also possible that glycerin was added to the product to change the product consistency rather than its effect on the hair, or simply because people *associate* it with moisture/hydration even though that's not the role it plays in the product.",

    "body": "I recently did an allergy patch test with my dermatologist. They gave me an app to download called ACDS CAMP and I entered a code that lists my allergens. It uses this data to determine if a product is “safe” or “unsafe”. \n\nSome of the products that I use are on the “UNSAFE” list, but when I look at the ingredients it lists something that is not on my allergen list.\n\nFor example I am allergic to the following:\n1) Chlorhexidine Digluconate, \n2) Methyldibromo Glutaronitrile, \n3) Amidoamine, \n4) Formaldehyde\n5) Compositae Mix (without fragrance), \n6) Nickel Sulfate, \n7) dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA), \n8) Propolis (without fragrance)\n\nWhen checking the ingredients for Eucerin Eczema-Prone Skin Relief Cream, it lists it as unsafe because it contains phenoxyethanol and BenzylAlcohol. These ingredients are not on my allergen list. \n\nAm I missing something? Does anyone have experience with this app and have similar problems?\n",

I also feel like if you're using a product already and you're not having issues in that area keep using it. There's a couple of things that I was using before my patch testing that are in my unsafe list that I'm still using with no issue. \n\nSidenote, I just started a subreddit that is contact allergy specific: r/weCantTouchThis.",

I am thrilled that I have not had any cysts or any (bad) pimples since then however my face is frustratingly really pink and red, a bit dry in places too.\n\nWith this said I just have two quick questions about these two products I've been using for almost all that time now too. I believe them too be gentle and good for sensitive skin. \n\nI do believe the main culprit could be my cleanser which is Eucerin DermatoCLEAN Refreshing Cleansing Gel . I checked on CosDNA and it didn't have anything overly concerning apart Sodium Benzoate at Safety Level 3.\n\nHere are the ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Coco Glucoside, Glyceryl Glucoside, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Trisodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate \n\nIf there is anything there which you might think be upsetting my skin please share!\n\nAs a night time moisturizer I have been using La Roche Posay CICAPLAST BAUME B5. Its a very thick and moisturizing cream I used since I was put on Accutane to combat the dryness which I believe it has done very well, anyway, \n\nhere are the ingredients: AQUA / WATER,\nHYDROGENATED POLYISOBUTENE,\nDIMETHICONE,\nGLYCERIN,\nBUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER,\nPANTHENOL,\nBUTYLENE GLYCOL,\nALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE,\nPROPANEDIOL,\nCETYL PEG/PPG-10/1 DIMETHICONE,\nTRISTEARIN,\nZINC GLUCONATE,\nMADECASSOSIDE,\nMANGANESE GLUCONATE,\nMAGNESIUM SULFATE,\nDISODIUM EDTA,\nCOPPER GLUCONATE,\nACETYLATED GLYCOL STEARATE,\nPOLYGLYCERYL-4 ISOSTEARATE,\nSODIUM BENZOATE,\nPHENOXYETHANOL,\nCHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE,\nCI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE\n\nI am starting to considering going back to the Dermo and get it sorted. When I last visited after finishing she said the redness is normal, but its been almost a year now. Thanks for listening\n\n\nAlso: I may be sensitive or allergic to aspirin. I got blood test at my doctor to test this and I am pending the results. However I do believe I have been avoiding any product falling in that family/chemical tree. ",

I've been dealing  with acne for years, and then recently my skin had been cooperating and  my acne had virtually disappeared aside from one or two hormonal  breakouts every so often. I decided it was one of those things where  time, luck, and a good routine worked spontaneously together. Tbh I  didn't care why my skin was behaving, it was just a huge relief. I'm  sure many of you can relate.\n\nBut recently  I went back to some old products with blind confidence my skin had  permanently improved, and broke out. This is tragic because every single  breakout on my skin scars no matter what I do. But now I'm trying to  educate myself and figure out what ingredients have caused me to break  out. The three products I suspect caused my breakout:\n\n\\-Switched from Cerave Baby lotion (love it, now I'm back to it and scared to change again) to the **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Face Moisturizer**,  Ingredients: Water, Glyceryl Stearate Se, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric  Triglyceride,  Cetyl Alcohol, Collodial Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Squalane,  Urea,  Allantoin, Ceramide Np, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter,  Limnanthes  Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil,   Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf   Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Caprylyl Glycol,   Phenoxyethanol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Leuconostoc/Radish Root   Ferment Filtrate, Edta.\n\n\\-Tried out my **IT Cosmetics CC cream**  that I used a long time ago when my acne was already bad, but now I  realize makes me breakout, Ingredients: ACTIVE INGREDIENTS: TITANIUM  DIOXIDE 9.0% ZINC OXIDE 6.3% INACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, SNAIL  SECRETION FILTRATE, PHENYL  TRIMETHICONE, DIMETHICONE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL,  BUTYLENE GLYCOL  DICAPRYLATE/DICAPRATE, ORBIGNYA OLEIFERA SEED OIL,  BUTYLOCTYL  SALICYLATE, CETYL PEG/PPG-10/1 DIMETHICONE,  CYCLOPENTASILOXANE,  CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE,  POLYGLYCERYL-4 ISOSTEARATE,  DIMETHICONE/VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER,  ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE, HEXYL  LAURATE, STEARIC ACID, CALCIUM STEARATE,  CAPRYLYL GLYCOL,  TRIETHOXYCAPRYLYLSILANE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CITRUS  MEDICA LIMONUM  (LEMON) PEEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, SORBITAN  ISOSTEARATE,  PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRUS AURANTIUM BERGAMIA (BERGAMOT) FRUIT  OIL,  1,2-HEXANEDIOL, DISODIUM EDTA, CITRUS AURANTIUM DULCIS (ORANGE)  PEEL  OIL, CITRUS AURANTIFOLIA (LIME) OIL, VITIS VINIFERA (GRAPE) SEED  OIL,  PUNICA GRANATUM SEED OIL, PINUS SYLVESTRIS LEAF OIL, PERSEA  GRATISSIMA  (AVOCADO) OIL, NIACINAMIDE, CITRUS GRANDIS (GRAPEFRUIT) PEEL  OIL,  CHOLESTEROL, ANTHEMIS NOBILIS FLOWER WATER,  LACTOBACILLUS/HONEYSUCKLE  FLOWER/LICORICE ROOT/MORUS ALBA ROOT/PUERARIA  LOBATA ROOT/SCHIZANDRA  CHINENSIS FRUIT/SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS  ROOT/SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER  EXTRACT FERMENT FILTRATE, PERFLUOROHEXANE,  OLEA EUROPAEA (OLIVE) LEAF  EXTRACT, GLYCERIN, EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS LEAF  OIL, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF  EXTRACT, CHRYSANTHEMUM INDICUM FLOWER  EXTRACT, PUERARIA LOBATA ROOT  EXTRACT, PERFLUORODECALIN, MORUS ALBA  FRUIT EXTRACT, MAGNOLIA KOBUS BARK  EXTRACT, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN)  SPROUT EXTRACT, DIOSPYROS KAKI LEAF  EXTRACT, CINNAMOMUM CASSIA BARK  EXTRACT, ARTEMISIA PRINCEPS LEAF  EXTRACT, PENTAFLUOROPROPANE, CURCUMA  LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT,  STEARETH-20, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID,  COLLOIDAL OATMEAL, HYDROLYZED  SILK, CITRIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE,  POTASSIUM SORBATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS  LEAF EXTRACT, N-HYDROXYSUCCINIMIDE,  HYDROLYZED COLLAGEN,  CAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID, TOCOPHEROL, THIAMINE HCL,  RIBOFLAVIN, RETINYL  PALMITATE, PANTOTHENIC ACID, PALMITOYL  OLIGOPEPTIDE, NIACIN, FOLIC ACID,  CHRYSIN, CARNITINE HCL, BIOTIN,  ASCORBIC ACID, PALMITOYL  TETRAPEPTIDE-7, CHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE. MAY  CONTAIN: IRON OXIDES (CI  77492, CI 77491, CI 77499).\n\n\\-**Aztec Healing Indian Clay w/ apple cider vinegar** to activate it.  Just throwing this in, kind of unrelated. I had this laying around, and after I broke out I  decided to whip it back out for a face detox. I suspect it made things  worse. I've always thought this broke me out, but there's only rave  reviews for it online so I always brushed it off as purging. But can  anyone else relate to ACV or the clay causing breakouts?\n\nAnyway,  I don't see too many similarities in these products. I don't think  I'm sensitive to alcohols, since I use Cerave just fine. Everything I  get is also fragrance free. I can't figure out what these have in common, or what common irritants for acne I'm missing. Any insights?\n\n&#x200B;",

Bơm rửa với NaOCl 3% và EDTA 17% riêng lẻ hoặc kết hợp không làm thay đổi đáng kể sức căng bề mặt răng.\n\n### EDTA với sóng siêu âm\n\nBơm rửa sóng siêu âm với dung dịch EDTA 17% trong 1 phút sẽ có hiệu quả trong việc loại bỏ lớp ngà mùn và mảnh vụn ở vùng chóp của ống tủy.\n\nEDTA hoạt động tốt hơn đáng kể so với NaCl và NaOCl trong việc loại bỏ lớp mùn và ống ngà mở.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dikozmckemc81.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa0cbe95c51123ee2d3e1916b9b5914dcd8603e9\n\n## Chlorhexidine\n\nChlorhexidine digluconate được sử dụng rộng rãi trong việc khử trùng vì hoạt tính kháng khuẩn tuyệt vời của nó. Tuy nhiên, nó hoàn toàn thiếu khả năng hòa tan mô\n\n## Cấu trúc Chlorhexidine (CHX)\n\nDung dịch Chlorhexidine (CHX) là một bis-guanide cation tổng hợp bao gồm hai vòng 4-chlorophenyl đối xứng và hai nhóm biguanide được kết nối bởi chuỗi hexam-ethylene trung tâm.\n\nCHX là một phân tử kỵ nước và ưa béo tích điện dương tương tác với các phospholipid và lipopolysaccharid trên màng tế bào của vi khuẩn và xâm nhập vào tế bào thông qua một số loại cơ chế vận chuyển chủ động hoặc thụ động.\n\n## Lợi ích dung dịch Chlorhexidine\n\nHiệu quả của nó là do sự tương tác giữa điện tích dương của phân tử với các nhóm phosphate tích điện âm trên màng tế bào vi sinh vật, làm thay đổi trạng thái cân bằng thẩm thấu của tế bào.\n\nĐiều này làm tăng tính thấm của màng tế bào, cho phép phân tử CHX xâm nhập vào tế bào vi khuẩn. Sự phá hủy lớp màng mỏng manh này dẫn đến sự rò rỉ của các thành phần nội bào, đặc biệt là các thực thể phosphate như adenosine triphosphat và axit nucleic.\n\nKết quả là, tế bào chất bị đông tụ, dẫn đến giảm rò rỉ; do đó, có một hiệu ứng hai pha đối với tính thấm của màng tế bào. Hoạt động kháng khuẩn CHX phụ thuộc vào độ pH, với phạm vi tối ưu là 5,5–0,7\n\n## Cơ chế hoạt động và tác dụng của Chlorhexidine (CHX)\n\n### Hoạt tính kháng khuẩn\n\nBasson và Tait đã so sánh hiệu quả ex vivo của canxi hydroxit, iodine kali iodide (IKI) và dung dịch Chlorhexidine (CHX) trong việc khử trùng hệ thống ống tủy bị nhiễm vi khuẩn Actinomyces israelii\n\nCác ống tủy đã tiếp xúc với IKI, canxi hydroxit, hoặc CHX 2% trong thời gian 3, 7 và 60 ngày. CHX là chất khử trùng duy nhất có thể loại bỏ A israelii.\n\nOncag và cộng sự đã đánh giá tính chất kháng khuẩn chống lại Enterococcus faecalis của dung dịch NaOCl 5,25%, CHX 2%, và CHX 0,2% kết hợp cetrimide 0,2% sau 5 phút và 48 giờ.\n\nCHX 2% và Cetrexidin® có hiệu quả hơn đáng kể đối với E. faecalis.\n\n#### Kết quả hoạt tính kháng khuẩn\n\nHai nghiên cứu đã khảo sát hoạt tính kháng khuẩn chống lại các tác nhân gây bệnh lý tủy răng ở ba nồng độ (0,2%, 1% và 2%) của hai dạng CHX (gel và chất lỏng) và so sánh chúng với năm mức nồng độ của NaOCl (0,5% , 1%, 2,5%, 4% và 5,25%).\n\nCả công thức gel 2% và dung dịch lỏng CHX 2% đều loại bỏ Staphylococcus aureus và Candida albicans trong vòng 15 giây, trong khi công thức gel tiêu diệt E faecalis trong vòng 1 phút.\n\nTất cả các chất bơm rửa được thử nghiệm đều loại bỏ *Porphyromonas endodontalis*, Porphyromonas gingivalis và *Prevotella intermedia* trong vòng 15 giây.",

Then a couple of days ago it started again. The tongue has been white for a long time but I delayed going to the  dentist, I was just supposing this would clear easily with some  mouthwash for candiasis or whatever it was. But then the white and red  spots started and now im so scared this can get worse. What do I do? Im  scared to make it worse by brushing it off.\n\nWhat  sort of doctor do I need to visit? I think dentists may not be experts on this and I need an inmunologist or something. I will try the mouthwash and hope it gets better but im so scared. I take thyroid  medication and I wonder if it's related, some autoinmunity. Im from Barcelona please recommend me the best doctors for this. Im scared  please help.",

    "body": "This seems like a pretty \"safe\" place to ask for feedback.  I'm sure you know what a poopstorm Facebook can be and I would love some honest and constructive feedback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the TL/DR up front\n\n* Figures and findings from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210060/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210060/) \\- I have a document with footnotes.\n* There is a growing awareness of the importance of sanitizing what we come into contact with.\n* Despite the prevalence of illness causing germs on phones and keyboards in the workplace, stats show that not many people regularly take time to disinfect them. Nobody wants to be sick and the employer doesn't want to lose productivity.\n* 52% clean their keyboard 1-2x a month. 32% clean phone 1-4x  a month. Even for employees who only do 1,000 kph, that's STILL 1,000 times a day they are coming into contact with infected equipment.\n* 92% of cell phones  and 95% of keyboards were contaminated... with “staphylococci”, but “*S. aureus*, coagulase negative staphylococci, bacilli (88% on keyboards) and micrococci were also present.” \n* Cleaning crews, if they do it at all, do it as an afterthought not as a specialty.\n* To me right now, $40k a year is comfortable (after tax).  \n* Low overhead. General liability insurance, supplies, tax.\n* 50k total firms in my MSA so even if I have 10 clients @ $5k a year or one client at $40k a year (doubtful, but to show scalability), I think I can reach $40-50k in the first year.\n* If I grow to 1% of the market, or 500 companies, I would hire workers  and gross an additional $200k for each 1% of the market.\n\n**Background** \n\nWhile many people are working from home, many are required to work in offices.  This pandemic may last a while longer, but on-site workers encounter a multitude of contaminants on their computers and phones that cause them to need to use sick days and nobody wants that.  It’s the worker’s task to maintain their equipment but, as shown below, most don’t and many cleaning crews don’t either.\n\nA study from the NIH in 2018 compared the results of regular disinfecting on 25 keyboards and 25 cell phones and stated that “52%... treat the keyboard on average 1–2 times a month.” This is attributed to the time it takes to disinfect over 101 keys.  “Spills and food deposits encourage the growth of millions of bacteria.” while “Dust can trap moisture and enable...bacteria that are already on the keyboard to flourish.” \n\nFurther, “Thirty-two per cent of respondents clean their mobile with a frequency of 1–4 times per a month…”  As with cell phones, office phones also are used in close proximity to  the “..face, ears, nose, lips, and hands, which are the most common infection gateways.\" and  “...pathogenic bacteria are present on...40% of mobile phones belonging to patients in a hospital and on approximately 20% of mobile phones belonging to...staff.” \n\nIf hospital staff aren’t immune to bacteria compromised electronics, it makes sense that  non-medical electronics users are also susceptible. Because of the number of people coming into offices there is ample opportunity for cross-contamination which can then be brought into people’s homes and infect other residents. \n\n**Types of contaminants - Staph and Strep and Bacilli, oh  MY!**\n\n92% of cell phones  and 95% of keyboards were contaminated... with “staphylococci”, but “*S. aureus*, coagulase negative staphylococci, bacilli (88% on keyboards) and micrococci were also present.”  Also found on the keyboards is yeast and mold which aggravate allergies in people who suffer from them. “Some bacteria can even be infectious in low doses and survive for hours or days in biofilm.”\n\n**Results of regular disinfecting**\n\nWith disinfection wipes that contain active ingredients such as “chlorhexidine digluconate and triclosan the reduction of contamination to zero was achieved in 60.9% of mobile phones, but only in 16.7% of keyboards.”  This is attributed to the  smaller number of surface areas on a phone versus over 100 separate keys leading to “dust and organic substrate” in between keys that act as a host.  This DOESN’T mean that it isn’t worth it to disinfect a keyboard. Staph, Strep, yeast and molds are eliminated 100% after disinfecting down to 31.8 for Bacillus  Even if only 1,000 keystrokes are made per day, that’s 1,000 times the user comes into contact with these contaminants. Yet 48% of respondents only cleaned their keyboard 1-2x a month (and I suspect most of these rounded-up to look better in the survey).\n\n**Proposal/Costs/Revenue expectation/Market**\n\nI just took an old keyboard out of storage and it was filthy.  Took me an hour and 15 minutes to deep clean and disinfect but looks good as new. I'm thinking it would take less than five minutes for regular disinfecting.  \n\nConsidering the importance of disinfecting in the workplace, would there be a market for cleaning and sanitizing keyboards and phones on a regular basis?  It would be labor intensive, so that would be the bulk of the cost. General liability at $50, over 160 work-hours in a month, is 3.1 cents/hr and supplies (Isopropyl 70% and microfiber towels) being another seven cents per hour.  If I can clean 12 keyboards per hour (leaving aside phones), I can gross 20/hr.  Companies will be assured employees are using clean equipment and employees won’t have the hassle of performing the work.\n\nInstead of 1-2x month, I could offer daily or weekly cleaning for up to 100% of the office staff. Of course, it would be more cost-effective to work at a single company for $40k a year but even if I just have ten clients, that would be $4k per client.  Being more expensive to conduct business than just one client, I’d probably have to add in a surcharge of 20% or so.  Conversely, I can market it as a deduction for a bigger contract.\n\nAccording to Thumbtack ([https://www.thumbtack.com/p/commercial-cleaning-prices](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/commercial-cleaning-prices)), the average hourly rate for office cleaning is $39, so $20/hr seems fair.  Also, I live in a city with over 7200 high-tech firms which account for over 160k jobs.  I assume they would use more expensive equipment so I can adjust for the extra maintenance (mechanical vs standard keyboard). There are over 50,000 total firms so finding 10 clients out of that shouldn’t be too difficult.

The other days will have contaminant build-up so they would have to do it themselves or hire me for each workday to get the most sanitization coverage.  \n\nEven with light use at 1,000 kph this is what bacteria on a keyboard looks like.  And, unlike phones, that's not even what comes close to your mouth when you sneeze, eat, etc...\n\n[https://thekeyboardreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uv-light-showing-bacteria-on-keyboard-science-photo.jpg](https://thekeyboardreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/uv-light-showing-bacteria-on-keyboard-science-photo.jpg)\n\nNot trying to cause undue concern.  We actually need bacteria in order to survive.  Without it we wouldn't be able to fight off colds.  Not sure we need Staph or Strep, though.\n\nSummary:\n\nCool! Companies DO do this.  Can only find a handful, but pretty sure I can carve something out of that. \n\nWhy don't more people do it themselves? Fatigue? Work 40+ hours a week and just want to leave after doing the work they are getting paid for and cleaning their equipment isn't in the job description?

It tells me there is a market for it.  Now, just need to get the right mix of clients at a certain price to add up to $40k.  \n\nIf only 1% of the 50k companies would hire someone to do this.  That's 500 companies. If there are 10 companies all competing, that's 50 clients to a cleaning company on average.  If I am one of those 10 companies, I would need to charge around $800/year per client.\n\nI guess my assumption would be the bigger companies are going to charge a premium, but they also provide more services.  I could look for smaller companies and non-profits to get established and make my goal.\n\nThanks for the great questions",

    "body": "I’ve had this very itchy scalp for 2-3 years now. I’ve seen two dermatologists for this and they said it’s folliculitis and seborrheic dermatitis. I’ve tried various treatments.\n\nHere’s what didn’t work:\n\n* Antibiotics: Lymecycline, Doxycycline.\n* Nizoral.\n* Eucerin dermocapillaire.\n* Dermax.\n* Apple cider vinegar.\n* Tea tree oil, this made it worse actually.\n* Salicylic acid.\n* Benzoyl peroxide.\n* Chlorhexidine digluconate, following healthyalmonds routine.\n* Fusidic acid.\n* Betamethasone valerate.\n\nWhat did work:\n\n* Coal tar, this only helps for about two hours then it gets itchy again.\n* Clobetasol propionate steroid shampoo. For four weeks it wasn’t itchy at all however they will not prescribe me more of this saying it can’t be used long term.\n\nAre there any other treatments that could help me? I’ve attached a few images so you can see my scalp. [https://imgur.com/a/JGIxq90](https://imgur.com/a/JGIxq90)",

Been to the vet 3 times already, and also had a microbiology test done (came back negative for any fungus). This has been going on for about a month, most of the time she has a collar on because she can't leave it alone.\n\nShe had three previous sebaceous gland episodes, but generally there was a lump and that the vet had to basically pop and clean, and it happened usually really quickly.\n\nThere's no lump here, and the last vet visit he tried to pop it but didn't work.\n\nThere's no sign of fleas anywhere.\n\nVet gave us a Chlorhexidine Digluconate / Isopropil soap to clean it once a day, been doing that for more than a week.\n\nit's not getting worse, but not getting better either.\n\nDog's about 7y old, mutt, 6.5kg\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QscMKFM](https://imgur.com/a/QscMKFM)\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Approximately 3.5 billion people are suffering from oral diseases today. It may not come as a surprise, but dental conditions like tooth decay, gum diseases and oral cancer can be prevented by simply maintaining oral hygiene. Some measures to ensure good oral health include:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5cs2ev9mmu681.png?width=454&format=png&auto=webp&s=2505c04ac6ef373830247b1526fc9727228c14a2\n\n**1. Brushing** \n\nAs cliched as it may sound, brushing your teeth with a soft or ultra-soft bristled toothbrush two times (in the morning and before going to bed at night) keeps your oral health in good condition. Using a manual or electric toothbrush can help remove the plaque layer from the teeth, whereas an interproximal brush can be used to clean the spaces between teeth that usually remain uncleaned with a regular brush. \n\n**2. Flossing**\n\nTo remove plaque and debris stuck between the teeth, braces and dental fillings, dentists use floss. Floss is nothing but a thread coated with wax. Regular flossing helps reduce gingival bleeding and the risk associated with developing cavities. \n\n**3. Tongue cleaning**\n\nTongue cleaning eliminates bad breath and ensures that your mouth remains clean. Use of metal, plastic scrapers or the non-bristle end of a toothbrush can help keep your tongue clean. \n\n**4. Mouthwash** \n\nMouthwashes are also one of the good ways to ensure oral hygiene. However, mouthwashes are distinguished into two main types. \n\n**1. Cosmetic mouthwash -** Used to eliminate bad breath\n\n**2. Therapeutic mouthwash -** Contains Chlorhexidine Digluconate and helps prevent and treat periodontitis. \n\nIt is important to know that mouthwashes should be diluted with water before their intended use. It has been suggested that consistent use of mouthwashes prevents teeth stains. \n\n**5. Frequent dental check-ups**\n\nTo ensure a healthy oral cavity, it is important to visit your dentist at least once in six months. If in case you experience bleeding gums, swelling, ulcers, pain or change in the appearance of the soft tissues inside the mouth, you should consult a dentist immediately. These signs can indicate a potentially serious problem.\n\n**6. Giving up unhealthy practices** \n\nComplete abstinence from tobacco in all forms (in cigarettes or smokeless) and chewing of areca nuts. Smoking could reduce the quantity of saliva that is secreted and could also make a person prone to developing lung cancer while chewing tobacco and areca nuts are known to lead to oral cancer. Consumption of alcohol should also be limited to two drinks a day. This ensures the secretion of a healthy amount of saliva in the mouth. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reason behind many dental and systemic diseases is a history of inadequate oral care. So, good oral health is a must for overall wellness. Brushing teeth, flossing regularly, using a mouthwash and tongue cleaning ensure oral hygiene. Ideally, one should visit a [**dentist in Sainte-Catherine**](https://www.cliniquedentairepg.ca/en/) twice a year and undergo oral examination and prophylactic cleaning to ensure that the teeth and mouth are in the pink of health.\n\nHenry Brown is the author of this Article: To know more about dentist in Sainte-Catherine please visit the Website: [**Cliniquedentairepg.ca**](https://Cliniquedentairepg.ca)",

They generally test some standard strains, as codified in the guidances listed. If you specifically want to kill rabies, you need to look for a disinfectant that is tested against rabies.  There should be ones marketed toward the veterinary industry that are specifically tested for efficacy against rabies.\n\nViruses on surfaces 'in the wild' are pretty easy to kill.  70% IPA for instance kills the ones you listed, and viruses can't survive long outside a host.  The disinfectant efficacy is usually meant for spills of virus cultures or cleaning areas where sick people or animals may have shed a lot of the virus.",

In December they had to readjust it and even cut into my gum so it would fit better.\n\nAs of today (May 2nd), my gums are red and swollen (the post is very poorly adapted), and I avoid chewing on that side.\nTo make matters worse, my mouth is in bad shape — on the side where I do chew, my gums are receding, and I'm missing a tooth in that area (I use a small acrylic partial denture to cover the space).\n\nA maxillofacial surgeon has already seen me and will soon operate on the right side — they'll place another post-and-crown on the lower arch and remove my wisdom tooth.\n\nLately, all these oral issues are making me feel very tense and stressed, and honestly, eating has become really difficult for me.\n\nRegarding the original post-and-crown, the dentist who did it refuses to take responsibility for redoing it and clearly did a poor job.\n\nI need advice on what I can do about this crown, because the gum around it is very red and inflamed. (I'm also wondering if it would make sense to use chlorhexidine digluconate.)\n",

I need help please](https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1kd3hng/faulty_postandcrown_i_need_help_please/)\n  \n  **Full text:** \n  \nHi everyone, so here's the situation: I got a post-and-crown done back in July, and since then it has fallen out about three times (the first time it came off just hours after getting it done). In December they had to readjust it and even cut into my gum so it would fit better.\n\nAs of today (May 2nd), my gums are red and swollen (the post is very poorly adapted), and I avoid chewing on that side.\nTo make matters worse, my mouth is in bad shape — on the side where I do chew, my gums are receding, and I'm missing a tooth in that area (I use a small acrylic partial denture to cover the space).\n\nA maxillofacial surgeon has already seen me and will soon operate on the right side — they'll place another post-and-crown on the lower arch and remove my wisdom tooth.\n\nLately, all these oral issues are making me feel very tense and stressed, and honestly, eating has become really difficult for me.\n\nRegarding the original post-and-crown, the dentist who did it refuses to take responsibility for redoing it and clearly did a poor job.\n\nI need advice on what I can do about this crown, because the gum around it is very red and inflamed. (I'm also wondering if it would make sense to use chlorhexidine digluconate.)\n\n\n  This is the original text of the post and is an automated service.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Last night in a desperate situation, I used two layers of LRP Lipikar Lotion. The bumps are suddenly much smaller, some have disappeared entirely. What could be the cause of this? I read somewhere that Lipikar has a ferment, but I can’t seem to find that information. Here’s the ingredients:\n\nAQUA / WATER • BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER • GLYCERIN • SORBITAN STEARATE • PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM / MINERAL OIL • NIACINAMIDE • BRASSICA CAMPESTRIS OLEIFERA OIL / GRAPESEED SEED OIL • ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE • DIMETHICONE • CERA ALBA / BEESWAX • SORBITAN TRISTEARATE • CARBOMER • SODIUM HYDROXIDE • POLOXAMER 338 • AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE • DISODIUM EDTA • SUCROSE COCOATE • CAPRYLYL GLYCOL • CITRIC ACID • T-BUTYL ALCOHOL • CETYL PALMITATE • BHT • PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE • CHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE\n\nSo what’s causing this sudden reduction? I don’t want to continue using this since it contains mineral oil and silicones, so I want to find what ingredients help my skin. Any ideas? Thanks!",

Typically, I advise my clients to opt for mild unscented soap, but unfortunately, there aren't many accessible options available where I'm located, especially in bottled form. However, we do have some alternatives like natural glycerin soap or dettol bar soap (although it can be harsh for some individuals even when diluted).\n\nThere is this medical grade antiseptic foaming solution made for post-surgery antibacterial/antifungal purposes. It requires dilution at a ratio of 1:10 and contains Hexamidine, Chlorhexidine digluconate, and Chlorocresol. I'm curious if anyone has used a similar product for tattoo aftercare and would love to hear your thoughts. Personally, I've tested it on my tattoos, as have a few others, and we haven't experienced any issues. In fact, some  have found it milder compared to non-medical grade soaps. However, I couldn't find any definitive answers through my research.\n\nI have several clients who ask if they can use this solution since it's readily available locally and classified as medical grade. To ensure I provide accurate recommendations, I'm seeking additional information and conducting proper testing. While health professionals have suggested it, I'm concerned it may be too harsh. Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated!",

Maybe it's overthinking it, but given the human idiocy one sees in any service industry, any time there are extra steps or instructions involved, an anxious or lazy person can (and will) screw them up. Immediately coming to mind:\n\n* The tattoo newbie who is anxiously overthinking aftercare and assumes more equals better, and who doesn't dilute it nearly enough.\n* The cheap person who wants to stretch it as far as possible and dilutes it too much.\n* The lazy (or just easily overwhelmed) person who can't handle extra steps such as properly measuring dilution and instead just grabs whatever easy (bad choice) soap is to hand.\n* The laissez faire person who just eyeballs ratios in the closest it-looks-clean-so-I'm-sure-it's-fine cup to hand.\n\nIf plain soap is hard to get locally, maybe you can find a source of suitable hotel-size soaps, or mini medical samples, order in bulk, and just give one to clients with the price worked into the tattoo?\n\n\\[Edit: slight correction of extra wording.\\]",

Çoğunlukla titanyum ve titanyum bileşiklerinden oluşan bir yapay diştir. Bu uygulama 30 yıldır devam etmektedir.\n\n[İmplant uygulaması](https://www.dmklinik.com)**ı**sonrası dikkat edilmesi gereken bazı unsurlar vardır. Özellikle işlemden sonra 2 saat boyunca bir şey yiyip içmeniz yasaktır. İmplant işlemi yaptıran kişilerin ilk 24 saat boyunca sıcak içecekler tüketmesi sakıncalıdır. Yalnızca ılık ve soğuk içecekler tüketebilirsiniz. Ayrıca implant işleminden sonra 1 hafta boyunca sıcak yiyecek ve içecekler tüketmemeye özen göstermelisiniz.\n\nİmplant operasyonu geçiren hastalara özel yumuşak diyet listesi verilmektedir. Bu sayede hastanın bir an önce iyileşmesi ve süreci ağrısız geçirmesi amaçlamaktadır. Ağıza atılan dikişler genellikle 7 gün sonunda alınmaktadır. Aynı zamanda doktorunuz gerek görür ise antibiyotik ilaç vermektedir. Genellikle Chlorhexidine Digluconate ağız gargarası kullanımı önerilmektedir.\n\nİmplant operasyonu sonrasında kanamayı durdurmak ve koagülasyonu stimüle etmek için steril bir tampon vasıtası ile baskı uygulanması önerilmektedir. Operasyon sonrası ilk 1 hafta boyunca ara ara kan gelmesi muhtemel bir durumdur. Özellikle sabahları uyandığınızda yastığınızda kan lekeleri görebilirsiniz. Bu sebeple endişe etmenize gerek olmadığınızı belirtmek isteriz. Operasyondan 36 saat sonra ağzınızı 2 hafta süresince tuzlu gargara veya ağız gargarası ile dezenfekte edilmesi sağlanmalıdır. Gargarayı 1 dakika boyunca yapmalısınız. Tükürükten sonra yarım saat boyunca herhangi bir içmeyin ve yemeyin.\n\n**İmplant uygulaması sonrası**ilk 24 saat sonra soğuk uygulama yapılması önerilmektedir. Doktorunuz da sizlere yapmanız ve yapmamanız gereken önemli hususlardan bahsedecektir. Operasyon sonrası ağız içine atılan dikişler hem yaranın hem de hastanın durumuna göre 1 hafta sonra alınmaktadır. Tüm bu uyarılar göz önüne alındığında kısa sürede ağızda iyileşme görülmektedir. Aynı zamanda ağrısız bir süreç geçirmeniz için bu unsurlara dikkat etmeniz gerekmektedir.\n\n[**İmplant Nedir**](http://dmklinik.com/implant-nedir)**?**\n\nİmplant, ağız içerisinde eksik olan dişlerin yerinin tutan yapay diş olarak tanımlanabilir. Eksik dişler hem sağlığı hem de estetik görünümü olumsuz yönde etkilemektedir. Gelişen teknoloji ile birlikte modern tıbbın sıkça kullandığı bir yöntemdir. Bu yöntem sayesinde ağız içerisinde eksik olan dişlerin yerine diş yapılmaktadır. Aynı zamanda diğer diş operasyonlarına göre**implant işlemi**dişlere zarar vermez. Kısacası implant doğal diş gibi rahat bir kullanım sunar. Yemek yerken veya içecek içerken kendi dişiniz gibi hissedeceksiniz.\n\nEtiketler;\n\n[İmplant](https://www.dmklinik.com/), [İmplant Tedavisi Bursa](https://www.dmklinik.com/), [Bursa İmplant Merkezi](https://www.dmklinik.com/), [Estetik Diş Hekimliği](https://www.dmklinik.com/), [DM Klinik](https://www.dmklinik.com/)",

I'm a 28 guy, I studied in Italy ( Ms.c in molecular biology ) until march 2022 with a thesis topic in Medical Microbiology and then I moved in Rotterdam. I applied for Research technician/ Research assistant position ( especially in Leiden or Amsterdam ) but all the companies, research institutes and hospitals refused my job application because I have no experience or often other candidates matches better with the job requirements, in their opinions. I compared the study program between Italy and Netherlands and I figured out that the Italian students make more exams and theory than the Dutch one. So, I tried to applied for a \"simple\" position to climb in a company's rank and make experience here in Netherlands but the recruiter said \"You're overrated for this position, you've got a Ms.c in biology\". I thought that a recruiter can help me better than the others and I contacted directly the HR or the laboratory manager of some company but the answer were always the same \"we do not have an open position and therefore will not be able to assist you further\" without an advice or tips. It's a terrible loop. They didn't call me even for an interview. I feel discouraged because the desire to start after 7 years of study is immense but nobody give a chance after 1 year from my degree. What a new graduate must do to draw attention? Which positions can I apply? I attached a Fac-simile of my resume and cover letter. I hope that someone could give me a tips to improve the CV / cover letter if is necessary or explain me what should I do for sorted out this problem \n\nPersonal Information  \n\nCitizenship: Italian                                                                       Residence: Rotterdam, Netherlands\nMobile phone: x                                                            Email: x  \n \nProfessional Summary:  My expertise is in Molecular and cellular biology, on topics such as microbiology, mycology, and infectious disease. I have practical skills in bacterial/fungi culture, carry out experiments in the development/ treatments of new drugs, molecular biology techniques ( PCR, multiplex RT-PCR, DNA extraction, SDS, ELISA ) and microbiology technique ( antimicrobial sensitivity techniques, mobility assay, and MALDI-TOF ). Also, I have an intermediate level in Matlab. \n\nEducation: \n\n• Master’s Degree in Biology (majoring in Molecular and cellular biology), from University Federico II, (Naples, Italy. 2019 – March 2022): Final grade: 104/110  Thesis: The glucocorticoid PYED-1 disrupts mature biofilms of Candida spp. and inhibits hyphal development in Candida albicans I tested the activity of the corticosteroid PYED-1 ( derivative of deflazacort, anti-inflammatory agent) against Candida species. It’s still used in the laboratory of Federico II to find new treatments. In addition, I tested the resveratrol's activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and how is able to modulate the susceptibility to the chlorhexidine digluconate ( biocide of Acinetobacter baumannii ).\n• Bachelor’s Degree in General and applied Biology from Università Federico II (Naples, Italy, 2015 – 2019)\n• Internship in the Department of \"Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology\" of Federico II University. My duties was to performed a multiplex Real time-PCR for identify the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC). BCC is a group of closely related species which includes opportunistic pathogens causing chronic respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients, or individuals affected by cystic fibrosis. (Naples, Italy, 09/2018 – 12/2018)\n• High School Diploma from Liceo Scientifico Virgilio (Pozzuoli, Italy, 2010 – 2015)  \n•  Language Skills  Italian: mother tongue                                   English: B2 \n\nCOVER LETTER \n\nDear Miss/Mr, My name is x and I'm a recent graduate in Biology ( Ms.c ) at Federico II University. I chose this faculty because it perfectly matches my most important characteristics: the curiosity that has distinguished me since childhood, my passion for science, and the need to see a purpose in what I dedicate myself to. These same reasons and my fascination for microbiology led me to apply for this job. Thank you for taking the time to review my materials and consider me. I decided to focus my Master’s Degree studies ( Ms.c ) on Molecular and cellular biology which have allowed me to extend my knowledge of the function of biological macromolecules and the cellular processes in which they are involved and a solid theoretical preparation in the following sectors: molecular microbiology, biochemistry, and protein engineering; molecular genetics and advanced molecular biology; genomics and computational biology. My experience to test the antifungal/antibacterial activity of the corticosteroid PYED 11hydroxy16α,17αepoxy3,20dione-- 1 (pregnadiene1) against Candida spp. ( Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida k rusei ) and Staphilococcus aureus responsible for most drugresistant infections has given me a real understanding of the importance of the research. In addition, I studied how the natural monomeric stilbenoid resveratrol (RV) was able to modulate the susc eptibility to the chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and benzalkonium chloride (BZK) biocides in Acinetobacter baumannii. This study analyzed a panel of reference strains and clinical isolates of Gramnegative bacteria, Grampositive bacteria, and yeasts tole rant to one or both biocides. Also, I took several laboratories and groups of researchers where I acquired practical experience in PCR, multiplex RTPCR, DNA extraction, SDS, MALDI TOF, and ELISA. Thanks to my project and my university careers path, I learned a lot about a wide range of topics such as working with bacteria/fungi and finding the right way to treat this terrible disease. I spent 2 years in Federico II hospital for my duties and now I am more determined to do something to contribute in the best way I can. At the Department of Medicine Microbiology, I worked as part of a closeknit team of researchers from different disciplines and nationalities. This increased my confidence in communicating my research to those outside my field and improved my int ercultural skills. Furthermore, I understand the difficult of research work. I can maintain focus on my individual tasks, with full knowledge of how they contribute to the overall research goals, no matter how repetitive my tasks are. Unfortunately from my background, many recruiters think that I have specific skills but my Ms.c has allowed me to deepen various aspects of biology.  Indeed, the practical experience isn't at the level of those who studied here in the Netherlands but with an important theoreti cal background, I'll be able to compensate for this gap. I have not interested in salary or position, what matters to me after 7 years of study is growing up in a company and improving my knowledge/handson under the supervision of other researchers. There fore, the chance to start a new path in Netherlands, where I can face new challenges by having the right tools is exactly what I am looking for. In conclusion, the desire to start is immense and I'm convinced that given the opportunity I would be a nice ad dition to a team and a great funny colleague to work with. I‟ll be more than happy to provide any further information if required. Kind regards",

A Medline search was done on June 5, 2022. The terms ‘monkeypoxvirus’, ‘poxvirus’ and ‘orthopoxvirus’ were used in combination with ‘disinfection’.\n\n\\[...\\] Results from an *in vitro* study showed that cultured orthopoxviruses may remain infectious at room temperature on galvanized steel and glass under laboratory conditions for 3 days (89% - 100% relative humidity) or up to 42 days (1% - 10% relative humidity) in the absence of organic load \\[10\\]. Variola virus in crusts obtained from a single smallpox patient with an initial viral load of approximately 2.2 x 108 could remain infectious in a sterile bottle at room temperature for up to 8 weeks at 85% - 90% relative air humidity or for up to 12 weeks in a dessicator \\[11\\]. Disinfection may therefore be relevant in the surrounding of confirmed cases to reduce the potential for viral spread via contaminated surfaces.\n\n* **Ethanol:** Ethanol was effective in suspension tests against the vaccinia virus strain Elstree and the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) in concentrations between 50% and 95% within 1 min even with different types of organic load. \\[...\\] At concentrations of 40% or less, ethanol revealed only poor efficacy against vaccinia viruses (Table I).\n* **Isopropanol:** Iso-propanol was effective against both viruses in concentrations between 40% and 75% within 1 min, mostly shown in the presence of 10% FCS, whereas a concentration of 30% revealed only a partial efficacy within 1 min (Table I). Formulations based on two types of alcohol with a total alcohol concentration between 75% and 77.8% were also very effective in 15 s (Table I).\n* **Hydrogen peroxide:** Hydrogen peroxide was effective in suspension tests against vaccinia virus at 14.4% in 30 s. \\[...\\] The efficacy against vaccinia viruses on artificially contaminated stainless steel carriers was sufficient under dirty test conditions when a solution of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide was applied for 10 min…\n* **Sodium hypochlorite:** Sodium hypochlorite (0.25% and 2.5%) was in addition effective against vaccinia virus under dirty test conditions on artificially contaminated stainless steel carriers in 1 min (Table VI).\n* **Iodine:** Iodine was also effective against vaccinia viruses in concentrations between 0.045% and 1% within 1 min under clean and dirty test conditions (Table IV).\n* **Benzalkonium chloride:** Solutions based on benzalkonium chloride (BAC) at 0.05% and 0.13% were not sufficiently effective in suspension tests against vaccinia viruses within 10 min. Products based on 0.0125% BAC (30 min) and 0.025% BAC (5 min), however, were effective but were tested only in the absence of organic load. A product based on either a ‘quaternary ammonium compound’ at 0.1% (30 min) or BAC at 0.015% (1 min) reduced vaccinia virus sufficiently. Products based on BAC with additional chlorhexidine digluconate or glutaraldehyde were also effective in 1 min in the absence of organic load during testing (Table V).\n* **Chlorhexidine digluconate:** A commercially available antimicrobial soap based on 4% chlorhexidine digluconate reduced the vaccinia virus strain Elstree in suspension tests in 30 s by 1.0 log10 and was not sufficiently effective \\[13\\].\n* **Copper:** The initial viral titer of both viruses (approximately 10\\^6 PFU) was reduced by ≥ 4 log10 within 3 min on \\[a surface made of 99%\\] copper…\n* **UVC light:** UVC light (254 nm) has been described to \\[inactivate\\] aerosolized vaccinia virus strain WR in a benchtop one-pass aerosol chamber in 7.6 s by 0.02 log10 to 2.3 log10. A lower relative air humidity increased the susceptibility of the vaccinia virus to UVC \\[25\\]. Similar results were found with the vaccinia virus Western reserve strain exposed for 10 min in aerosol to UVC light (254 nm). Under steady state conditions a reduction between 0.9 and 2.4 log10 was found with higher values in winter \\[26\\].\n\nOnly very few data were found to describe the efficacy of biocidal agents or disinfectants against the monkeypox virus. Most studies were done with different strains of vaccinia virus which could be inactivated by at least 4 log10 in suspension tests and on artificially contaminated surfaces by 70% ethanol (≤ 1 min), 0.2% peracetic acid (≤ 10 min) and 1% to 10% of a probiotic cleaner (1 h), mostly shown with different types of organic load. Hydrogen peroxide (14.4%) and iodine (0.04% - 1%) were effective in suspension tests, sodium hypochlorite (0.25% - 2.5%), 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.55% orthophthalaldehyde were effective on artificially contaminated surfaces. Glucoprotamin at 0.07%, 0.13% and 0.26% showed an insufficient efficacy on artificially contaminated surfaces and some effect in suspension tests where the limit of detection did not allow to measure a 4 log10 reduction. Benzalkoniumchloride was partly effective depending on its concentration and the exposure time, chlorhexidine digluconate at 4% (30 s) was not sufficiently effective. A surface of 99.9% copper was also very effective against vaccinia virus and monkeypox virus. \n\nOnly one study was found with a direct comparison of the susceptibilties of a vaccinia virus and a monkeypox virus to copper. A similar susceptibility of both viruses was found towards the biocidal agent \\[23\\]. In addition, a comparable susceptibility of the vaccina virus strain Elstree (e.g. ATCC VR-1549, used for decades in disinfectant efficacy testing) and the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA; recently established in disinfectant efficacy testing) to four commercially available disinfectants used in veterinary medicine was shown by Hartnack et al. \\[33\\]. Finally, early experiments showed that the variola virus could be effectively inactivated by 50% to 70% ethanol in 1 min, 40% to 50% iso-propanol in 1 min, 0.1% to 2% sodium hypochlorite in 1 min and 0.5% benzalkonium chloride in 5 min \\[34\\] which corresponds to the results obtained with vaccinia viruses described before. **Based on these data it is reasonable to assume that the different orthopoxviruses have a similar susceptibility to disinfectants**.\n\n\\[...\\] Crusts are an obstacle to determine real life virucidal activity especially when suspension tests reveal favourable results \\[35\\]. In addition, it has been shown that **vaccinia virus embedded in rabbit dermal scabs are more difficult to inactivate. Under these experimental conditions complete viral inactivation, which is not required by a disinfection procedure, was achieved by 2% glutaraldehyde in 1 h, 80% ethanol, 70% iso-propanol and 60% n-propanol in 3 h** whereas a quaternary ammonium compound did not achieve complete viral inactivation in 18 h \\[36\\]. The type and amount of organic load has been established to have a major impact on the efficacy of disinfectants against vaccinia viruses \\[22\\]\\[37\\].\n\n\\[...\\] Another limitation is the lack of efficacy data under practical conditions for many disinfectants, e.g. on artificially contaminated surfaces according to EN 16777 without mechanical action or according to EN 16615 with mechanical wiping. For surface disinfection one study with a glucoprotamin-based disinfectant described that data from suspension tests do not correlate with data from carrier tests indicating that the **efficacy in real life may be substantially lower than in suspension tests** \\[31\\].\n\n\\[...\\] In healthcare it is **important that a disinfectant exerts its virucidal effect in a short contact time especially when volatile biocidal agents such as alcohols are used**. The data obtained with vaccinia viruses indicate that some biocidal agents are sufficiently effective within 1 min depending on their concentration such as alcohols, glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, monocitric acid, sodium hypochlorite, iodine and some formulations with two different biocidal agents. Ozone, a probiotic cleaning agent and benzalkonium chloride mostly required a longer exposure time of up to 1 h which may be too long in the patients surrounding.”",

Bơm rửa với **NaOCl 3%** & **EDTA 17%** lẻ tẻ hoặc phối kết hợp không làm chuyển đổi đáng chú ý sức căng mặt phẳng răng.\n\n### EDTA với sóng siêu âm\n\nBơm rửa sóng siêu âm với dung dịch EDTA 17% trong 1 phút sẽ có hiệu quả trong những công việc vứt bỏ lớp ngà mùn & mảnh vụn ở vùng chóp của đường ống dẫn tủy.\n\nEDTA vận động tốt hơn đáng kể so với NaCl và NaOCl trong các công việc sa thải lớp mùn và ống ngà mở.\n\n## Chlorhexidine\n\n**Chlorhexidine digluconate** được sử dụng quá rộng thoải mái trong việc **khử trùng** vì hoạt tính **kháng khuẩn** tuyệt hảo của chính nó. Tuy nhiên , nó toàn vẹn thiếu kinh nghiệm hòa tan mô\n\n## kết cấu Chlorhexidine (CHX)\n\nDung dịch **Chlorhexidine** (CHX) là 1 trong những bis-guanide cation tổng hợp bao gồm hai vòng 4-chlorophenyl đối xứng & hai nhóm biguanide được kết nối bởi chuỗi hexam-ethylene trung tâm .\n\nCHX là một trong những phân tử kỵ nước & ưa béo năng lực dương liên hệ với những phospholipid và lipopolysaccharid trên màng các cấu trúc tế bào của những con vi khuẩn & xâm nhập vào các cấu trúc tế bào thông qua một số trong những loại cơ chế vận chuyển chủ động hoặc thụ động.\n\n## công dụng dung dịch Chlorhexidine\n\ncông dụng của chính nó là do sự liên hệ giữa điện tích dương của phân tử với những nhóm phosphate năng lượng âm bên trên màng tế bào vi khuẩn, làm chuyển đổi triệu chứng điều độ thẩm thấu của tế bào.\n\nđiều này làm gia tăng tính thấm của màng tế bào , có thể chấp nhận được phân tử CHX xâm nhập vào các tế bào những con vi sinh vật . Sự hủy hoại lớp màng mỏng tanh này dẫn theo sự rò rỉ của các phần tử nội bào, nhất là các phần tử phosphate như adenosine triphosphat và axit nucleic.\n\ncông dụng là, các cấu trúc tế bào chất bị đông tụ, dẫn theo giảm rò rỉ; do đấy, có 1 cảm giác hai pha so với tính thấm của màng các cấu trúc tế bào. Chuyển động kháng khuẩn CHX dính vào độ pH, với phạm vi tốt nhất là 5,5–0,7\n\n📷\n\n## cơ chế vận động & công dụng của Chlorhexidine (CHX)\n\n### Hoạt tính kháng khuẩn\n\nBasson và Tait đã đối chiếu công dụng ex vivo của **canxi hydroxit, iodine kali iodide** (IKI) & **dung dịch Chlorhexidine** (CHX) trong những việc khử trùng khối hệ thống đường ống dẫn tủy bị nhiễm vi khuẩn **Actinomyces israelii**\n\nnhững ống tủy đã tiếp xúc với IKI, canxi hydroxit, hoặc CHX 2% trong khoảng thời gian 3, 7 và 60 ngày.

Now, we DO need some bacteria so we can fight off illness, but staph and strep? Not so much. Plus, clean them today, they will be contaminated tomorrow.  It's an uphill fight. I get that.\n\nThere are a handful of companies here that are general office cleaners but in my personal experience, they never cleaned the phones or keyboards. Empty trash, sure. Vac the floors? Not really in workstations.\n\nReason I am asking is that I am thinking of offering complete keyboard cleaning. Wiping a disinfectant cloth over the keyboard is literally over the keys, and not on the other 4 sides, or the bottom.  It DOES help, but the other sides are still breeding grounds for germs. 92% of cell phones  and 95% of keyboards were contaminated... with “staphylococci”, but “*S. aureus*, coagulase negative staphylococci, bacilli (88% on keyboards) and micrococci were also present.”  \n\nWith disinfection wipes that contain active ingredients such as “chlorhexidine digluconate and triclosan the reduction of contamination to zero was achieved in 60.9% of mobile phones, but only in 16.7% of keyboards.”  This is attributed to the  smaller number of surface areas on a phone versus over 100 separate keys leading to “dust and organic substrate” in between keys that act as a host.\n\nIf it takes two minutes with Isoprophyl and a Q-tip to do the keyboard, phone, mouse. I am sure I can carve out a business making workers' lives easier by providing this service. $2/ for one time a week. $8 for a 5-day week, something along those lines. That's for standard keyboards. Some people spend $100s for keyboards and it may be worth it to pop off the keys  and completely clean it out for $20. \n\nAt $2/one time a week, 10 will take me 20 minutes and get me $20 for half hour work. In a 4 hour day, 5x a week, 52 weeks, that's over $40k to work half-time.  Granted I will have to commute but that's built into the $20/30 minutes instead of the 20 it will take to do the work. \n\nAlso, I live in Austin and there are a lot of businesses located close to each other.",

However, a new study found that as amazing as it is for your health, rinsing your mouth with mouthwash can also help minimize cavities and gum problems.\n\n**What is mouthwash?** \n\nMouthwashes are topical anesthetics that temporarily relieve soreness and inflammation after dental work. A mouthwash consists of a solution formulated to dissolve the surface plaque. It contains either benzalkonium chloride (baking soda) or chlorhexidine digluconate (Hibiclens). The chemical ingredients in these solutions act on bacteria (softly hardening gums, which makes them more susceptible to decay) and help to strengthen teeth.\n\n**Why do we use mouthwash?** \n\nYou might be surprised to hear that the answer is something as simple as the daily brushing and flossing you perform on all your other teeth. Brushing removes plaque, which builds up in the spaces between your teeth, causing them to damage and turn into cavities.\n\n*Mouthwash vs. brushing teeth?* \n\nIt's an age-old debate that many parents and dentists have about the best ways to care for those precious pearly whites. There are several reasons why mouthwash might be the better bet over traditional toothbrushing methods, but their effectiveness varies depending on your specific situation and expectations.\n\nMouthwash is one of the best ways to keep your breath fresh but also ensures you’re not suffering from bad breath. This is because it isn’t as strong as a regular gargle, so it can be more gentle on your gums and teeth while also improving your oral hygiene.\n\n**Do you love a mouthwash that is not only effective but also smells great?**\n\nIf so, then [Swish by Colgate Mild Spearmint Antibacterial Alcohol-Free Mouthwash](https://www.truegether.com/category/health-and-beauty) may just be for you. Your teeth will love the minty flavor of this mouthwash, and your breath will be clean and fresh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u26bqxsqua9b1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=34801eee3732ca9923d40ea96f30c0394f44d468\n\nColgate mouthwash, a product widely known for its quality and excellence has now come up with Swish by Colgate. Swish is a new and innovative product that suits both Indian as well as Western taste buds.

    "body": " \n\nHello there :)\n\nAfter several years of seeing many a doctor, who all failed to see anything remotely wrong, I'm trying to see if y'all would have an idea! It's a bit of a clusterfuck of non-specific symptoms, that are highly invalidating, most of which have lasted for a while. Of course, impossible to know which ones are linked to one another, and which ones aren't, so it's even funnier!\n\nMight be something stupidly simple nobody thought about, might be a crazy zebra. Hopefully someone around here have seen something before and might help \\^\\^'\n\nSo, let's go with a chronology. Please remember, I cannot say if those symptoms are linked.\n\n**- December 2006: Severe chronic cough**  \n***Context***: after a severe pharyngitis, the fever and soreness went away, but the coughing remained forever. The cough is a tickling one around the larynx, as if the valve between the oesophagus and trachea didn't properly close. To make it weirder, the cough only happens when it's cold (autumn/winter/spring or if there's air conditioning). If it's warm, nothing happens. Finally, the coughing fits are quite severe, enough for me to break my own ribs (happened 2 times) and pop blood vessels in the face (happened too many times to count).\n\n**- September-to-December 2012: Right-side joint pain (arm/hand)**  \n***Context***\\*:\\* after quite a long time playing some intense League of Legends (ah, challenger league...), my joints in the right hand started hurting severely, to the point of making playing impossible. The pain is radiating from the Carpometacarpal and Metacarpophalangeal joints of the ring and pinky fingers, as well as the Ulnocarpal joint. It's a constant, deep-feeling, dull ache. It gets worse if there are repeated movements (e.g.: clicking fast, moving back and forth, ...). The constant pain is a 2-3/10 nowadays, and it goes up to a solid 7-8/10 if I have to do those repeated movements.\n\n**- June 2019: Left-side joint pain (arm/hand).**  \n***Context***: Exactly the same as the right-side pain, except it was caused by a whole week of CTRL+C/CTRL+V'ing at work, because I had to help a colleague. The spreading of the pinky finger to press CTRL and the index finger to press C/V ended up causing the same kind of pain I have on the right side. Just like on the right side, it's a constant 2-3/10 pain, that can move up to a 7-8/10 if I use my left hand a lot.\n\n**- March 2021: Left-side neck pain.**  \n***Context***: Once more a dull deep pain that will not disappear. It popped out of nowhere one morning, and is severe enough to radiate all the way to the eye (causing a severe migraine) and down in the shoulder. The general painful area is around the top of the Levator scapulae muscle, although the muscle itself may not be the main cause (it's just \\*this area\\*).\n\n**WHAT WAS DONE AND TRIED:**  \nOf course I saw a broad variety of doctors, here's what was found out (or more like never found out).  \n\\- **COUGHING:**  \nSinus CT scan: negative (no trace of any problem).  \nA broad variety of nasal sprays, such as Azelastine And Fluticasone: no effect on the cough  \nSeveral steroidian and non-steroidian anti-allergics: no effect on the cough  \nPulmonary function test: done in 2007, all good. Another one will be done in 2 weeks, most likely with the same result.  \nAllergic scratch test: no allergies found.  \nNose cleaning apparatus (Rhino horn/Neti pots): no effect on the coughing.  \nActisoufre (sulfur nose spray): some efficiency in calming a coughing fit.  \nChlorhexidine digluconate tabs: some efficiency in calming a coughing fit.  \n*So far, three otorhinolaryngologists have given up.*\n\n**- HAND/ARM PAINS:**  \nEchography looking for tendinitis in the wrist, elbow and shoulder: nothing to see, all good.  \nElectromyogram: results are perfect.  \nMRI of both hands: all looks perfect so far, no trace of arthritis.  \nMRI of the neck and brain: no trace of disc hernias or brain tumors.  \nAngiogram: checked the arm, for a potential Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. All good, circulation's fine.  \nNSAIDs: no effect. Tried ibuprofene, diclofenac (tablets & gel), ketoprofene, prednisolone, to no avail.  \nMuscle relaxants: no effect. Tried methocarbamol (gel & tablets).  \nParacetamol: mild effect.  \n\"Just some rest\": no effect. While resting the hands and arms does lower the pain, the pain never goes below 2/10. Also, using them AT ALL will make the pain flare back up, no matter how long they had rested in the first place.  \nKinesitherapy: No effect.  \nHeat: definitely helps and lowers the pain level dramatically (but it has to be really warm, like 30+°C)  \n*So far, two internists and three rheumatologists have flat-out given up, saying \"it's just like that sometimes\".*\n\n**- NECK PAIN:**  \nMuscle relaxants: no effect.  \nCelecoxib: extremely effective, but only for a short period of time (after \\~3 months, it has no effect).  \nKetoprofene: extremely effective (but causes several lovely digestive issues that become hard to live with after more than a week).  \nMRI: no trace of hernia or ankylosing spondylitis.  \n*For the moment, one rheumatologist has ended up dismissing it as \"just a torticollis\". I'm not aware of any torticollis that reacts to Celecoxib and lasts for over 6 months but y'know.*\n\n**PATIENT HISTORY:**  \nDiabetic (type 1), since 1991. Well balanced, HBA1C evolves around \\~5.6% and \\~6.2%. Treated via standard basal/bolus (Tresiba/Fiasp pens).  \nBenign thyroid nodule, removed in 2017. T3, T4 and TSH levels are just fine. No specific medication taken.  \nMild autism/ADD combo. No specific medication taken (except a fuckton of coke zero / tea for the caffeine in order to be vaguely functional).  \nAppendicitis in 2001. Was quite severely infected, but now it's gone.  \nSleep apnea. Treated with a breathing thing that is making nights even more annoying.  \nAdenoidectomy at 2 years old, following a (hell of a) lot of ear infections.\n\nCurrently, there are no theories. My GP would like to check collagen-related issues, but with very little hope. Next steps are to see a new internist in Paris, to run a new pulmonary function test, and see an audiologist (ORL specialized in the larynx/pharynx area). Of course, as usual, it will yield fucking nothing lol.\n\nSo there you have it! It's starting to be a bit of a problem, because I essentially can barely use my hands for more than an hour, and I live with an almost constant head and neck ache (that of course makes it extremely difficult to sleep in any position). And of course, coughing all the damn time.  \nAs I mentioned,I have no idea if those are linked, or not. But they're the reason why I wish I could just sleep for 50 years until someone can figure this shit out - cause life is seriously not worth living right now, after 10 years of that shit.\n\nAgain, I'm (somewhat) hoping someone around here may have seen the same kinds of issues. Fixing just ONE of those would be a life changer, so... you never know :) Thanks!",

    "body": "Hello everyone, in this journey of long covid at least I’m happy to say that so far my symptoms were not too harsh. Only two episodes of fever and loss of taste and smell. But the main purpose of this post is that I’ve tried something that possibly was the responsible for getting my taste and smell back.\n\nSo here it goes, after a week without taste and smell I started to gargle with anti bacterial mouthwash named Eludril Classic which is a combination of 2 ingredients; antibacterial Chlorhexidine digluconate (0.1%) and Chlorobutanol (0.5%) 3x times a day and also Strepsils which is also a antibacterial and antiseptic \nin form of pills to suck which contains a combination of two effective antiseptic ingredients: 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol and 1.2mg amylmetacresol.\n\n\nI’m mentioning the composition because I don’t know if this products with this name exists on your country. Here in Portugal and at least in Europe I think they exist under this name. After two days my taste and smell started to get back to normal, worked with me and with a friend of mine.\n\nI can also recommend gargle in between with warm salt water. When you gargle make sure that the liquid touches your throat.\n\nI hope this can help someone else.\n\nStay strong my friends!",

I didn't feel anything at first, but after a few seconds I could feel the whole area burning. I assumed it was just normal pain and walked away to wait. Now I don't think it was, it's been 45 minutes and it's still burning, the pain won't stop and it midly intense. I tried using water but it doesn't do anything.\n\nWhy is this happening? As far as I'm concerned I'm not allergic to the spray as I used it several times already. Is there any way to make the pain stop?",

    "body": "Hello everyone, I'm writing this post to discuss the difficult that I found to search a job in Netherlands. I explain you my situation in details. I'm a 28 guy, I studied in Italy ( Ms.c in molecular biology ) until march 2022 with a thesis topic in Medical Microbiology and then I moved in Rotterdam. I applied for Research technician/ Research assistant position ( especially in Leiden or Amsterdam ) but all the companies, research institutes and hospitals refused my job application because I have no experience or often other candidates matches better with the job requirements, in their opinions. I compared the study program between Italy and Netherlands and I figured out that the Italian students make more exams and theory than the Dutch one. So, I tried to applied for a \"simple\" position to climb in a company's rank and make experience here in Netherlands but the recruiter said \"You're overrated for this position, you've got a Ms.c in biology\". I thought that a recruiter can help me better than the others and I contacted directly the HR or the laboratory manager of some company but the answer were always the same \"we do not have an open position and therefore will not be able to assist you further\" without an advice or tips. It's a terrible loop. They didn't call me even for an interview. I feel discouraged because the desire to start after 7 years of study is immense but nobody give a chance after 1 year from my degree. What a new graduate must do to draw attention? I attached a Fac-simile of my resume and cover letter. I hope that someone could give me a tips to improve the CV / cover letter if is necessary or explain me what should I do for sorted out this problem \n\nPersonal Information  \n\nCitizenship: Italian                                                                       Residence: Rotterdam, Netherlands\nMobile phone: x                                                            Email: x  \n \nProfessional Summary:  My expertise is in Molecular and cellular biology, on topics such as microbiology, mycology, and infectious disease. I have practical skills in bacterial/fungi culture, carry out experiments in the development/ treatments of new drugs, molecular biology techniques ( PCR, multiplex RT-PCR, DNA extraction, SDS, ELISA ) and microbiology technique ( antimicrobial sensitivity techniques, mobility assay, and MALDI-TOF ). Also, I have an intermediate level in Matlab. \n\nEducation: \n\n• Master’s Degree in Biology (majoring in Molecular and cellular biology), from University Federico II, (Naples, Italy. 2019 – March 2022): Final grade: 104/110  Thesis: The glucocorticoid PYED-1 disrupts mature biofilms of Candida spp. and inhibits hyphal development in Candida albicans I tested the activity of the corticosteroid PYED-1 ( derivative of deflazacort, anti-inflammatory agent) against Candida species. It’s still used in the laboratory of Federico II to find new treatments. In addition, I tested the resveratrol's activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and how is able to modulate the susceptibility to the chlorhexidine digluconate ( biocide of Acinetobacter baumannii ).\n• Bachelor’s Degree in General and applied Biology from Università Federico II (Naples, Italy, 2015 – 2019)\n• Internship in the Department of \"Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology\" of Federico II University. My duties was to performed a multiplex Real time-PCR for identify the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC). BCC is a group of closely related species which includes opportunistic pathogens causing chronic respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients, or individuals affected by cystic fibrosis. (Naples, Italy, 09/2018 – 12/2018)\n• High School Diploma from Liceo Scientifico Virgilio (Pozzuoli, Italy, 2010 – 2015)  \n•  Language Skills  Italian: mother tongue                                   English: B2 \n\nCOVER LETTER \n\nDear Miss/Mr, My name is x and I'm a recent graduate in Biology ( Ms.c ) at Federico II University. I chose this faculty because it perfectly matches my most important characteristics: the curiosity that has distinguished me since childhood, my passion for science, and the need to see a purpose in what I dedicate myself to. These same reasons and my fascination for microbiology led me to apply for this job. Thank you for taking the time to review my materials and consider me. I decided to focus my Master’s Degree studies ( Ms.c ) on Molecular and cellular biology which have allowed me to extend my knowledge of the function of biological macromolecules and the cellular processes in which they are involved and a solid theoretical preparation in the following sectors: molecular microbiology, biochemistry, and protein engineering; molecular genetics and advanced molecular biology; genomics and computational biology. My experience to test the antifungal/antibacterial activity of the corticosteroid PYED 11hydroxy16α,17αepoxy3,20dione-- 1 (pregnadiene1) against Candida spp. ( Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida k rusei ) and Staphilococcus aureus responsible for most drugresistant infections has given me a real understanding of the importance of the research. In addition, I studied how the natural monomeric stilbenoid resveratrol (RV) was able to modulate the susc eptibility to the chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and benzalkonium chloride (BZK) biocides in Acinetobacter baumannii. This study analyzed a panel of reference strains and clinical isolates of Gramnegative bacteria, Grampositive bacteria, and yeasts tole rant to one or both biocides. Also, I took several laboratories and groups of researchers where I acquired practical experience in PCR, multiplex RTPCR, DNA extraction, SDS, MALDI TOF, and ELISA. Thanks to my project and my university careers path, I learned a lot about a wide range of topics such as working with bacteria/fungi and finding the right way to treat this terrible disease. I spent 2 years in Federico II hospital for my duties and now I am more determined to do something to contribute in the best way I can. At the Department of Medicine Microbiology, I worked as part of a closeknit team of researchers from different disciplines and nationalities. This increased my confidence in communicating my research to those outside my field and improved my int ercultural skills. Furthermore, I understand the difficult of research work. I can maintain focus on my individual tasks, with full knowledge of how they contribute to the overall research goals, no matter how repetitive my tasks are. Unfortunately from my background, many recruiters think that I have specific skills but my Ms.c has allowed me to deepen various aspects of biology.  Indeed, the practical experience isn't at the level of those who studied here in the Netherlands but with an important theoreti cal background, I'll be able to compensate for this gap. I have not interested in salary or position, what matters to me after 7 years of study is growing up in a company and improving my knowledge/handson under the supervision of other researchers. There fore, the chance to start a new path in Netherlands, where I can face new challenges by having the right tools is exactly what I am looking for. In conclusion, the desire to start is immense and I'm convinced that given the opportunity I would be a nice ad dition to a team and a great funny colleague to work with. I‟ll be more than happy to provide any further information if required. Kind regards",

You can stop applying in companies they are only interested in specialized expats and that is not you. If you had a PhD it would be different. \n\nNow the only option I see for you, is to apply with universities. They might offer you a technician position because they might want someone on MSc level to lead a project that cannot be a PhD project. Second, academic people have a preference for subject matching subject. You interned for hiv apply for hiv, doesn't matter if you don't understand the techniques. \n\nThird, I did not read your complete cv, but do you only have a MSc thesis experience? \n\nIf you pm me I have more tips for you on how to breakthrough in academics and what worked for me.\n\nEdit: I also see a lot of grammatical errors in both your cv en cover letter.",
