    "body": "OR Nurse here.  This is kind of a long one...\n\nI was taking call one night, and woke up at two in the morning for a \"general surgery\" call.  Pretty vague, but at the time, I lived in a town that had large populations of young military guys and avid meth users, so late-night emergencies were common.\n\nGot to the hospital, where a few more details awaited me -- \"Perirectal abscess.\"  For the uninitiated, this means that somewhere in the immediate vicinity of the asshole, there was a pocket of pus that needed draining.  Needless to say our entire crew was less than thrilled.\n\nI went down to the Emergency Room to transport the patient, and the only thing the ER nurse said as she handed me the chart was \"Have fun with this one.\" Amongst healthcare professionals, vague statements like that are a bad sign. \n\nMy patient was a 314lb Native American woman who barely fit on the stretcher I was transporting her on. She was rolling frantically side to side and moaning in pain, pulling at her clothes and muttering Hail Mary's.  I could barely get her name out of her after a few minutes of questioning, so after I confirmed her identity and what we were working on, I figured it was best just to get her to the anesthesiologist so we could knock her out and get this circus started.  \n\nShe continued her theatrics the entire ten-minute ride to the O.R., nearly falling off the surgical table as we were trying to put her under anesthetic.  We see patients like this a lot, though, chronic drug abusers who don't handle pain well and who have used so many drugs that even increased levels of pain medication don't touch simply because of high tolerance levels.  \n\nIt should be noted, tonight's surgical team was not exactly wet behind the ears.  I'd been working in healthcare for several years already, mostly psych and medical settings.  I've watched an 88-year-old man tear a 1\"-diameter catheter balloon out of his penis while screaming \"You'll never make me talk!\".  I've been attacked by an HIV-positive neo-Nazi.  I've seen some shit.  The other nurse had been in the OR as a trauma specialist for over ten years; the anesthesiologist had done residency at a Level 1 trauma center, or as we call them, \"Knife and Gun Clubs\".  The surgeon was ex-Army, and averaged about eight words and two facial expressions a week.  None of us expected what was about to happen next.\n\nWe got the lady off to sleep, put her into the stirrups, and I began washing off the rectal area.  It was red and inflamed, a little bit of pus was seeping through, but it was all pretty standard. Her chart had noted that she'd been injecting IV drugs through her perineum, so this was obviously an infection from dirty needles or bad drugs, but overall, it didn't seem to warrant her repeated cries of \"Oh Jesus, kill me now.\"\n\nThe surgeon steps up with a scalpel, sinks just the tip in, and at the exact same moment, the patient had a muscle twitch in her diaphragm, and just like that, all hell broke loose. \n\nUnbeknownst to us, the infection had actually tunneled nearly a foot into her abdomen, creating a vast cavern full of pus, rotten tissue, and fecal matter that had seeped outside of her colon.  This godforsaken mixture came rocketing out of that little incision like we were recreating the funeral scene from Jane Austen's \"Mafia!\".  \n\nWe all wear waterproof gowns, face masks, gloves, hats, the works -- all of which were as helpful was rainboots against a firehose.  The bed was in the middle of the room, an easy seven feet from the nearest wall, but by the time we were done, I was still finding bits of rotten flesh pasted against the back wall.  As the surgeon continued to advance his blade, the torrent just continued.  The patient kept seizing against the ventilator (not uncommon in surgery), and with every muscle contraction, she shot more of this brackish gray-brown fluid out onto the floor until, within minutes, it was seeping into the other nurse's shoes. \n\nI was nearly twelve feet away, jaw dropped open within my surgical mask, watching the second nurse dry-heaving and the surgeon standing on tip-toes to keep this stuff from soaking his socks any further. The smell hit them first. \"Oh god, I just threw up in my mask!\"  The other nurse was out, she tore off her mask and sprinted out of the room, shoulders still heaving.   Then it hit me, mouth still wide open, not able to believe the volume of fluid this woman's body contained.  It was like getting a great big bite of the despair and apathy that permeated this woman's life.  I couldn't fucking breath, my lungs simply refused to pull anymore of that stuff in.  The anesthesiologist went down next, an ex-NCAA D1 tailback, his six-foot-two frame shaking as he threw open the door to the OR suite in an attempt to get more air in, letting me glimpse the second nurse still throwing up in the sinks outside the door.  Another geyser of pus splashed across the front of the surgeon.  The YouTube clip of \"David at the dentist\" keeps playing in my head -- \"Is this real life?\"\n\nIn all operating rooms, everywhere in the world, regardless of socialized or privatized, secular or religious, big or small, there is one thing the same:  Somewhere, there is a bottle of peppermint concentrate.  Everyone in the department knows where it is, everyone knows what it is for, and everyone prays to their gods they never have to use it.  In times like this, we rub it on the inside of our masks to keep the outside smells at bay long enough to finish the procedure and shower off.\n\nI sprinted to the our central supply, ripping open the drawer where this vial of ambrosia was kept, and was greeted by -- an empty fucking box.  The bottle had been emptied and not replaced.  Somewhere out there was a godless bastard who had used the last of the peppermint oil, and not replaced a single fucking drop of it.  To this day, if I figure out who it was, I'll kill them with my bare hands, but not before cramming their head up the colon of every last meth user I can find, just so we're even.\n\nI darted back into the room with the next best thing I can find -- a vial of Mastisol, which is an adhesive rub we use sometimes for bandaging.  It's not as good as peppermint, but considering that over one-third of the floor was now thoroughly coated in what could easily be mistaken for a combination of bovine after-birth and maple syrup, we were out of options.  \n\nI started rubbing as much of the Mastisol as I could get on the inside of my mask, just glad to be smelling anything except whatever slimy demon spawn we'd just cut out of this woman.  The anesthesiologist grabbed the vial next, dowsing the front of his mask in it so he could stand next to his machines long enough to make sure this woman didn't die on the table.  It wasn't until later that we realized that Mastisol can give you a mild high from huffing it like this, but in retrospect, that's probably what got us through.  \n\nBy this time, the smell had permeated out of our OR suite, and down the forty-foot hallway to the front desk, where the other nurse still sat, eyes bloodshot and watery, clenching her stomach desperately.  Our suite looked like the underground river of ooze from Ghostbusters II, except dirty.  Oh so dirty.\n\nI stepped back into the OR suite, not wanting to leave the surgeon by himself in case he genuinely needed help.  It was like one of those overly-artistic representations of a zombie apocalypse you see on fan-forums.  Here's this one guy, in blue surgical garb, standing nearly ankle deep in lumps of dead tissue, fecal matter, and several liters of syrupy infection.  He was performing surgery in the swamps of Dagobah, except the swamps had just come out of this woman's ass and there was no Yoda.  He and I didn't say a word for the next ten minutes as he scraped the inside of the abscess until all the dead tissue was out, the front of his gown a gruesome mixture of brown and red, his eyes squinted against the stinging vapors originating directly in front of him.  I finished my required paperwork as quickly as I could, helped him stuff the recently-vacated opening full of gauze, taped this woman's buttocks closed to hold the dressing for as long as possible, woke her up, and immediately shipped off to the recovery ward. \n\nUntil then, I'd only heard of \"alcohol showers.\"  Turns out 70% isopropyl alcohol is about the only thing that can even touch a scent like that once its soaked into your skin.  It takes four or five bottles to get really clean, but it's worth it.  It's probably the only scenario I can honestly endorse drinking a little of it, too.\n\nAs we left the locker room, the surgeon and I looked at each other, and he said the only negative sentence I heard him utter in two and a half years of working together:\n\n\"That was bad.\"\n\nThe next morning the entire department (a fairly large floor within the hospital) still smelled.  The housekeepers told me later that it took them nearly an hour to suction up all of the fluid and debris left behind.  The OR suite itself was closed off and quarantined for two more days just to let the smell finally clear out.\n\nI laugh now when I hear new recruits to healthcare talk about the worst thing they've seen.  You ain't seen shit, kid.\n\ntl;dr Don't shoot IV drugs into your taint.",

        "body": "OR Nurse here.  This is kind of a long one...\n\nI was taking call one night, and woke up at two in the morning for a \"general surgery\" call.  Pretty vague, but at the time, I lived in a town that had large populations of young military guys and avid meth users, so late-night emergencies were common.\n\nGot to the hospital, where a few more details awaited me -- \"Perirectal abscess.\"  For the uninitiated, this means that somewhere in the immediate vicinity of the asshole, there was a pocket of pus that needed draining.  Needless to say our entire crew was less than thrilled.\n\nI went down to the Emergency Room to transport the patient, and the only thing the ER nurse said as she handed me the chart was \"Have fun with this one.\" Amongst healthcare professionals, vague statements like that are a bad sign. \n\nMy patient was a 314lb Native American woman who barely fit on the stretcher I was transporting her on. She was rolling frantically side to side and moaning in pain, pulling at her clothes and muttering Hail Mary's.  I could barely get her name out of her after a few minutes of questioning, so after I confirmed her identity and what we were working on, I figured it was best just to get her to the anesthesiologist so we could knock her out and get this circus started.  \n\nShe continued her theatrics the entire ten-minute ride to the O.R., nearly falling off the surgical table as we were trying to put her under anesthetic.  We see patients like this a lot, though, chronic drug abusers who don't handle pain well and who have used so many drugs that even increased levels of pain medication don't touch simply because of high tolerance levels.  \n\nIt should be noted, tonight's surgical team was not exactly wet behind the ears.  I'd been working in healthcare for several years already, mostly psych and medical settings.  I've watched an 88-year-old man tear a 1\"-diameter catheter balloon out of his penis while screaming \"You'll never make me talk!\".  I've been attacked by an HIV-positive neo-Nazi.  I've seen some shit.  The other nurse had been in the OR as a trauma specialist for over ten years; the anesthesiologist had done residency at a Level 1 trauma center, or as we call them, \"Knife and Gun Clubs\".  The surgeon was ex-Army, and averaged about eight words and two facial expressions a week.  None of us expected what was about to happen next.\n\nWe got the lady off to sleep, put her into the stirrups, and I began washing off the rectal area.  It was red and inflamed, a little bit of pus was seeping through, but it was all pretty standard. Her chart had noted that she'd been injecting IV drugs through her perineum, so this was obviously an infection from dirty needles or bad drugs, but overall, it didn't seem to warrant her repeated cries of \"Oh Jesus, kill me now.\"\n\nThe surgeon steps up with a scalpel, sinks just the tip in, and at the exact same moment, the patient had a muscle twitch in her diaphragm, and just like that, all hell broke loose. \n\nUnbeknownst to us, the infection had actually tunneled nearly a foot into her abdomen, creating a vast cavern full of pus, rotten tissue, and fecal matter that had seeped outside of her colon.  This godforsaken mixture came rocketing out of that little incision like we were recreating the funeral scene from Jane Austen's \"Mafia!\".  \n\nWe all wear waterproof gowns, face masks, gloves, hats, the works -- all of which were as helpful was rainboots against a firehose.  The bed was in the middle of the room, an easy seven feet from the nearest wall, but by the time we were done, I was still finding bits of rotten flesh pasted against the back wall.  As the surgeon continued to advance his blade, the torrent just continued.  The patient kept seizing against the ventilator (not uncommon in surgery), and with every muscle contraction, she shot more of this brackish gray-brown fluid out onto the floor until, within minutes, it was seeping into the other nurse's shoes. \n\nI was nearly twelve feet away, jaw dropped open within my surgical mask, watching the second nurse dry-heaving and the surgeon standing on tip-toes to keep this stuff from soaking his socks any further.

    "body": "TLDR: didn't realize how deep my belly button was and never cleaned it fully, it sealed up and I cracked it open like a cold beer\n\n\nThis happened 3 days ago and I'm still a bit traumatized. I was taking a shower and cleaning my belly. I do clean my belly button, but I only ever really swabbed the entrance and thought that was good enough. On this fateful day, I wasn't really paying attention to what I was doing. My soapy washcloth slipped and plunged deep into the depths of my navel. I felt a brief but intense pain--almost like I had just poked myself hard in the belly button.\n\n\nAfter a quietly muttered \"ow\" and a cursory check for blood or viscera, I finished my shower and went about my day. I foolishly believed that my belly button problems were behind me. Little did I know...\n\n\nI spent the rest of the day with a growing pain in my navel region. I felt discomfort when I bent down, or even laid on my belly. I brushed off the pain, assuming that I had simply bruised my belly with my inadvertent poke. However, the next day I was still in pain so I took a look at the offending area. \n\n\nAs a quick aside, I've always had a deep belly button. Like, the innies of innies. I could plunge my finger in up to my proximal phalanx with no issues. But when I looked at my belly button now, it seemed deeper and.... wider than before. And what's worse, a layer of gunk had accumulated around the entrance to my old mouth. (Think of the kind of gunk that builds up around ear piercings; it's mainly sebum, dirt, and old skin). My belly button had never been obviously dirty before, so I knew something was afoot (or abelly?).\n\n\nAfter a quietly muttered \"wtf, ew\", I fetched a tissue and wiped away the offending schmutz. I considered where this muck may have come from, and realized that it must have originated from my belly depths. I grabbed a q-tip and gingerly inserted it into my belly button. \n\n\nFour q-tips later and my horror was mounting rapidly. My belly button was so dirty. And so, so deep. And so, so, so stinky. I swabbed the decks as best I could, then just sat and stared into the middle distance for a bit. \n\n\nHave you ever had a moment when your perception of yourself as a functional adult human being is completely shattered? When you realize that there is a fundamental aspect of self-care that you've just... never done? When you wonder how you've made it this far as a person in society? This...this was my moment.\n\n\nI texted my mom (a retired nurse) to confirm my fears. I believe that my navel neglect resulted in a build up of gunk that slowly filled up my belly button. At some point, I think the gunk sort of... sealed my belly button together like some sort of disgusting letter. When my washcloth slipped, I broke the seal of my decades-old missive and freed the contents. \n\n\nTo date, this is the silliest and most embarrassing injury I've ever inflicted upon myself. My mom joked that I could try carbon dating my layers (I'm a geologist), and said that the pain I'm feeling is probably because the gunk in my belly was stretching out that area and affecting my pain receptors. Now I'm leaving my belly button alone for a few days to see if it heals up and feels better. If not, I'm headed to the doctor. \n\n\nMoral of this story: remember to brush your old mouth, or you'll end up like me--fundamentally and irrevocably changed, with a sore belly and a mind full of regrets.\n\n\nE: to clarify--I'm taking care of my belly button and will wash it out with hydrogen peroxide and isopropyl alcohol. Also, I'm a woman with tiny baby hands and smol fingies, but I'm learning that my belly button may be abnormally deep. Maybe I'm in the running for a new Guinness World Record, where do I go to submit an application?",

Water has a very high surface tension since it can make strong hydrogen bonds to itself, whereas alcohol does not hydrogen bond to itself as easily, therefore does not hold itself together as strongly as water.\n\nBecause the oxygen attached to the hydrogen has a lot of electrons, it is more hungry for electrons, and when attached to hydrogen, sucks its electron away, forming a slight negative charge on the oxygen and a slight positive charge on the oxygen. Because opposites attract, the slightly negative oxygen attracts a slightly positive hydrogen and they form a “hydrogen bond” where they are held together by opposite charges but with no sharing of electrons.\n\nWater molecules are also much smaller than alcohol molecules and the oxygen in a water molecule is more electronegative than the ones in an alcohol.

I scrubbed about three times as long as I usually would until someone told me that the “soapy” feeling on my hands wasn’t soap anymore, that’s just the way the soft water felt. Well I’ve got to imagine pure isopropyl alcohol is about as “soft” as a liquid substance can get. It’s not so much an actual feeling that’s different from other liquids, it’s the complete, or nearly complete, absence of other minerals in the liquid.",

MAKE IT STOP** \n\n**Originally posted to r/Cooking & r/CleaningTips** \n\n**Thanks to u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU** \n\nMOOD SPOILER: >!If this post smells like cinnamon, you aren't imagining things!< \n\n[Too many apples. how to use them (that isnt a pie)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/s/sGB0p8L7bt)  **Oct 8, 2024** \n\nwent apple picking and ended up with wayyyy too many macintosh apples. ive already made 6+ pies, apple tarts, apple mini pies, baked apples... and i still have 2 dozen apples ..please share any ideas on how to get through a horde of apples \n\nEDIT - THANK YOU!!! \nso far tonight i made applesauce and have 2 trays of dried apple slices in the oven right now! 14 apples remaining!! \n\n**TOP COMMENTS** \n\n**mrmadchef** \n\n>Apple butter? I think you can even make it in a slow cooker. \n\n**~** \n\n**violet_violet** \n\n>Apple butter, for sure!!! I've always made mine in a slow cooker. Peel and chop your apples, cover and let them cook down for several hours on high, blend, add sugar (I usually do brown sugar), spices and a little lemon juice, then let cook uncovered for several more hours on low. It keeps for ages in the freezer and makes for great Christmas gifts, too.\n\n\n>As far as baking goes, my two favorite non-pie apple recipes are both from Smitten Kitchen: [apple and cheddar scones](https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/10/apple-and-cheddar-scones/), and [big apple crumb cake](https://smittenkitchen.com/2021/10/big-apple-crumb-cake/). In fact, I'm planning to make one of them today, just not sure yet which one. 😅 \n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/s/Lh52KM4ywj)  **Oct 15, 2024** \n\ni made apple butter and now my slowcooker has a permament cinnamon smell. i tried soaking the lid in soapy aater for an hour. i washed every part 8 times, unscrewed the handles and cleaned every nook any cranny.. but IT WONT GO AWAY!!! and its not a faint smell its a cinnaMAXIMUM smell in the lid. \n\nis there a product i can use? or do i just have to accept my fate? \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**fruithasbugsinit** \n\n>Try slow cooking two cups of 1:1 vinegar and water. Then let it air out and cool down for a day or so for the vinegar to go away. \n\n>ETA: Unless you have birds as this can hurt or kill them with their sensitive systems. \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>have I wronged you in the past? \nmy home. my santuary. is being forcibly air marinated. \n\n>>I'm dry heaving with each breath as the tiny vapors of this weaponized witches brew of Cinnamon Vinegarette Salad Dressing deep dives into my esophagus. \n\n**OOP Adds a mini update** \n\n[Mini Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/s/MLOBYAbSRG) \n\n*Processing img 2kt1d1bta1vd1...* \n\nUPDATE - the mixture of vinegar and cinnamon scents wafting through my kitchen is permeating through my eyeballs and directly into my soul. \n\n**wawa2022** \n\n>Throw a piece of fish in that baby.

I was hoping that sunlight and fresh air would help, but my lid is not made of vampires. \n\nAccepting temporary defeat I moved the fight back onto home turf, and got a new set of supplies. Shout out to u/generic-curiosity who reminded me about the hydrophobic properties of my cinnenemy. With this knowledge, I was ready to reengage in this battle \n\nI armed myself with a bottle of isopropyl alcohol, a Love is Blind sized wad of paper towels, and…olive oil. \n\nI scrubbed with alcohol, then rubbed it down with the oil, then back at it again with the alcohol.  Out of context, that would make for an amazing party game. \n\nthis Sisyphean deodorizing battle will haunt my dreams for years to come. \n\nI don’t remember how many times I repeated this alcohol and oil endeavor, but I’m going to choose the number 6, because of the evil connotations of the number. \n\nMuch like my spirit, the smell has died down and has become a repressed whisper of the wild soul it once was. \n\nSatisfied that my slow cooker no longer bore the tonsil-coating scent of a season craft store mid-december, I went on my merry way. Ignorant, I Know. \n\nAs the days went on, and I continued to use more kitchen supplies, I began to think this was all in my mind – I just. Kept. Smelling. It. SOMEWHERE. \n\nLike any sane person I started sniffing around my kitchen like a tweaked out 2 legged bloodhound.  I had used a rubber spatula to stir my cinnncoction. Immediately binned it. I refuse to bend my will for the $2 spatula. And now, it will never see the light of day again, forever to think about how it failed to serve its culinary master. Forever to miss the hot broth it once knew. It must suffer in perpetuity for its betrayal. \n\nAnd I am NEVER using cinnamon again. \n\nthe apple butter tastes amazing. \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

        "body": "Hey - if you're handy I can describe how to actually repair the joysticks. There's lots of half-baked suggestions flying around. Electronics contact cleaner is a band-aid at best.\n\nThe issue is one of two things:\n\n1. LIKELY ISSUE: Debris within joystick assembly\n2. POSSIBLE ISSUE: Wearing of the internal variable-resistor contacts in the joystick\n\nSince you've only had them for 4 months, I highly doubt it's the second issue.\n\nThe reason contact cleaner only works for a little while is because the debris remains trapped within the joystick. The contact cleaner does move the debris off the internal contacts, but eventually the debris will re-settle on the contacts and cause drifting again.\n\nYou will need to open the joystick and clean it out if you want a longer-term solution.\n\nTools needed:\n\n* Tri-wing screwdriver\n* Precision tweezers (flat head is suggested) - these are my favorite and most-used tool\n* Plastic spudger\n\nFor reference: u/rainbopython recently posted a tear-down [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/58bBc43)\n\nThe trickiest part is removing the sheet metal backer from the joystick. I did my best keeping the 90-degree tabs intact to bend them back in place but they snapped in just one reassembly cycle. Best bet is to intentionally remove those tabs - the other two are sufficient, and it makes assembly/disassembly *much* easier.\n\nOnce opened, using a swab (preferably lint-free so you don't leave fibers behind, but cotton should do - just inspect the surface afterwards), clean the surface of the circuit with isopropyl alcohol. You'll also want to clear the other parts of the joystick, especially towards the main opening of the joystick itself as that is where dust enters.\n\nWhen reassembling, be careful not to damage the thin metal pins on the contact blocks.",

I realize isopropyl is different than ethonol, but isopropyl still gets you just as drunk (well in this case even more drunk cus it's 91%). I'm not saying the isopropyl poisons them in some magical painless way, I'm saying that by being completely covered in 91% and having holes all over their body (insects do) they are basically being made instantly extremely drunk to the point that all nerve impulses would start to shut down and there would be an inability to feel pain. Also headcannon means I don't know whether what I'm talking about is actually true. Stop telling me that I don't know what I'm talking about when the first line of my statement was me admitting that.

        "body": "SHELL GIVES RAW MATERIAL FREE OF CHARGE\n20 Mar 2020\n\nThe corona pandemic (COVID-19) calls for far-reaching measures. One is hand washing, thoroughly and often. As a result, the worldwide demand for disinfectant is exploding. An essential raw material for these is produced at the Shell factory in Pernis: isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Shell has decided to make 2.5 million liters of this raw material available free of charge for the production of hand sanitizer for the healthcare sector in the Netherlands. “Fantastic, this is exactly what we need,” says Niels Maijers, currently responsible for the availability of the funds from the Dutch Federation of Academic Hospitals and the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. \"This certainly provides a solid foundation for the coming months in the Netherlands.\"\n\nIn addition to this measure, Shell will increase the production of IPA in the coming period and production capacity will be made available. \"Everything to meet the growing demand for hand sanitizer\", says sales manager Tomas Rieu and product manager Yuriy Yanson of Shell: \"In this way we make our contribution to the fight against the corona virus.\"\n\nLarge factory, large production\nThe Shell factory in Pernis is one of the largest factories in the world and, among other things, produces the raw material IPA for a large part of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Tomas Rieu of Shell: “We are proud of the big capacity and the security of supply that we offer our customers. Customers can count on us. ”\n\nIsopropyl alcohol: a synthetic alcohol\nIsopropyl alcohol, IPA for short, is in fact a synthetic alcohol. This raw material is used for various purposes. \"Very diverse,\" says product manager Yuriy Yanson. “Think of coatings, adhesives, detergents or crop protection. And so IPA is also an important raw material for the pharmaceutical and medical industry. It is precisely here that IPA is urgently needed now that the coronavirus is raging worldwide and hygiene and disinfection are essential. ”\n\nFor hand sanitizer and disinfectants\nDisinfectant hand gel is made from the raw material IPA. “Most consumers know those hand gels,” says Rieu. “There is currently enormous demand worldwide. However, products with IPA are also needed in hospitals, mental healthcare institutions, care for the disabled and elderly care. Think of all kinds of means to disinfect medical equipment and surfaces. Very important at the moment. ” IPA as an ingredient is essential and determines the disinfectant effect of these products.\n\nProduction of IPA substantially increased: sufficient quantity for the Netherlands\nShell has therefore decided to immediately and substantially increase the production of isopropyl alcohol. \"The factory is running at full speed within the set safety standards,\" says Yanson. \"Twenty-four hours a day.\" Shell is in constant dialogue with its customers about the production and delivery of the synthetic alcohol. “Our customers appreciate our approach. We will have to do it together. ” Sales manager Tomas Rieu says: “We are also consulting with the Dutch government. We have indicated that we guarantee sufficient stock for the Netherlands. ”\n\nProduction capacity released\nIn addition to the production increase, production capacity in the Pernis factory has also been made available to produce mainly for the medical and pharmaceutical industry. “We ask customers who use IPA for other applications to postpone their orders,” says Rieu. The share of production that now goes to the medical and pharmaceutical sector is many times higher than normal. According to Yanson and Rieu, it is imperative to accommodate the medical and pharmaceutical industries in this way. \"We are working hard to make our contribution to the fight against the corona virus.\"",

    "body": "So this isn't my story. I had a coworker (CW) who left for another job because it was $7 more per hour. Totally understandable. \n\nSo CW takes this 'amazing' job. Apparently within the first week she realizes that her A-hole Boss, is a complete drunk psychopath. He would come in daily with a case of beer or bottle of tequila, or something else alcoholic. He also had a lot of pills, Adderall, Vicodin, any addictive drugs he had it...Boss tells CW that he makes over 10k daily...a literal golden goose.\n\nCW was hired to be the manager in a warehouse that packaged Kratom. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's a tree from SE Asia the leaves have alkaloids that affect the opioid receptors in your brain. It helps with pain and gives a person energy. It also helps mitigate the withdrawal symptoms from opioids. \n\nWithin the first two weeks, CW was yelled at for helping her team package. Screamed at in front of her team. Made to feel stupid. CW was also sexually harassed by boss. He would make comments about her body, 'You think because you have a nice ass you can do whatever you want.' CW often left work in tears. About 2 weeks later boss brings in his side piece or mistress and tells CW that mistress is a manager as well... though mistress didn't do anything other than play on her phone and sit on her a**. Unless Boss was around.\n\nI live in a state where cannabis is legal, medical and recreational. Apparently Boss was using marijuana shake in place of Kratom. He was also spraying the Kratom with THC distillate (it's what is put into vapes). But selling it to smoke shops as CBD infused Kratom. But he wasn't using ethanol or butane to extract it, both are safe for human consumption...AB was using isopropyl alcohol, which is toxic to humans. Also, in my state any marijuana that is extracted with isopropyl alcohol will NOT pass the testing. BECAUSE it's NOT for human consumption.\n\nHere comes the petty revenge. CW quits without notice, stops answering any calls from Boss or Mistress \n\nWhen she told me how he was extracting the THC. I told her what he was doing was illegal and VERY detrimental for society. Every state has a board that monitors marijuana, we'll call them the Board. I told CW she should contact The Board and let them know what Boss was doing. \n\n1. He didn't have a license for the marijuana which is required by any state with it legalize.\n2. He was causing harm and possible death for anyone who used his products.\n3. He was a drunk sexual harassing psycho\n4. What he was doing was wrong\n6. Labeling something with infused CBD when it's THC is wrong \n5. CW could report it anonymously\n\n\nAbout a week later CW hears through the grapevine that the Board showed up and Boss was totally drunk with a bottle of tequila open in front of him. Pills all over his desk. It was NOT a good day for Boss. \n\nEnd of story: Boss ended up having his business shut down. The Board are known for give huge fines up to $mil Possible jail time, court fees, lawyer fees. I think Boss deserved it!\n\nEdit: updated with less acronyms. I was following all of other posts I've been reading. Please This was my 1st post! No, I'm not a professional writer. I work at a marijuana grow house NOT a newspaper. I figured mistress was much less derogatory then any any of the other names she was given.\nI also addressed the Iso. \n\nThank You for the up votes!!!",

You cannot consume the alcohol itself directly, but our bodies are fully capable of processing it without any toxic metabolites. It's no more toxic than ethanol, just far more intoxicating due to its potency. I have worked in the cannabis industry in the past, and we regularly use isopropyl alcohol for cleaning our equipment, and for winterizing extractions that were going into the decarboxylarion pot afterwards, since this boils off 100% of the alcohol before eating it. What your boss was doing is both wrong and illegal for other reasons, but the use of isopropyl alcohol for this kind of work is actually perfectly safe. \n\nAlso, neither of the drugs in this article are known to cause death in isolaton or when combined. I use pretty heavy doses of both for the reasons you posted at the start, mainly pain and to treat the fatigue from said pain. The only deaths known to have happened, where kratom was involved, were from combining it with other depressants known for their potentially deadly synergy with other CNS depressants. On its own, kratom doesn't cause much if any respiratory depression, dependant on dose, and its extremely hard to even try to OD on, because you'll puke up your dose before getting that far. \n\nI'm glad he got shut down though, anyone doing what he was doing, deserves whats coming to him. Kratom is so important for combating the opioid epidemic, it's saved so many lives, and anyone threatening that AND legal cannabis in one go, deserves what's coming to them in my book. Also glad it wasn't supplies lol, they're still around because they're not fucking idiots like him",

Also incredibly useful to have around for medical purposes.  I'm never buying a bug spray again.",

    "body": "As a retired IT support person, I don't take it for granted that people know even the most basic facts about how to work computers, much less keep their Sims game working properly. It pains me when week after week I see posts from simmers who have lost long-time legacy saves or elaborate builds because of failures that could have been prevented.\n\nSo here is a list of the most basic tips that will help protect the game you love.\n\n**Computer basics:**\n\n* Never just switch off power on your computer when still running, even if all your programs are closed. Use the Shutdown command instead, because it triggers clean-up processes that keep your computer in good health.\n* If you use your computer often, letting it go into sleep mode is better than frequent Shutdowns.\n* Close all your software programs and Restart your computer at least once a week. This ensures that memory and other processes are cleared out and optimized. (Be sure you use the actual **Restart** command for this.)\n* At the very least, once or twice a year run a cleaner program that removes malware and other intrusive programs that slow down your computer.\n* Also, please hire someone to *rid your PC or laptop of dust* at least once a year, at least twice a year if you have pets. You can also do this yourself with compressed air! Just please be careful and don't touch any computery bits to be on the safe side. If something needs a wipe-down, isopropyl alcohol is your best friend. The higher proof, the better. Do not use water to clean opened electronics!\n* Make sure you have at least 15-20GB of free space on your boot drive. You need that much for the Sims (and other programs) to run smoothly. If you're running out of space, you can buy a 1TB external SSD for under $100 and move your Sims program files over to that drive, then point your EA settings to that new location.\n* For Windows users: OneDrive can wreak havoc on Sims files. I ended up disabling it entirely. At the very least, make sure you exclude the Documents > EA folder from your OneDrive sync (click on the small sync icon to the immediate left of the folder name). Back up manually instead.\n\n**The Sims 4 basics:**\n\n* Save often. I save every sims night when everyone (more or less) is in bed. I also save before possible death events, like grilling on the back porch, or after great achievements that I don't want to lose. (ETA: another simmer suggested saving in the morning when at least one sim wakes up, rather than when they're all asleep since this can create timing issues)\n* Exit the game (close it down) at sane intervals. For me, that's every night when I'm done playing. Throughout the day I may exit to the Main Menu, but at the end of my RL day, I exit the game.\n* If you're not closing the game because loading takes too long, then you need to fix that problem, not just try to work around it. Maybe you need more memory (it's cheap right now), or more storage (it's cheap right now). But keeping the game running will allow memory leaks and other issues to accumulate to the point where they could render your game inoperative. At the very least, close down once a week, then restart your computer (see above).\n* BACK UP YOUR SAVES! All you need is a thumb drive. Copy over your Saves folder and date it. (Saves\\_12-23-2024) I back up every few days and keep at least a month's worth of saves on my backup drive. ETA: If you want to preserve your Library contents, backup the Tray folder, too.\n\nOkay, I feel better now. Happy holidays, Simmers!\n\nETA: Thanks to [ferretsincorporated](https://www.reddit.com/user/ferretsincorporated/) and various other commenters for additional tips that I've incorporated into my lists above.",

Don't play on high settings, don't download so much CC, don't use reshade, don't overdo house decorations with clutter, don't open more than one program while playing (not even browser), that's how you destroy your potato.\n\n- If you r CC hoarder, organize your mod folder. It's not optional anm when your folder is more than 10gb\n\n- If you play on laptop, make sure the laptop fan is well ventilated, esp if it's a gaming laptop. Play on table, put on a laptop stand, if you like to play lying down than put a book underneath the laptop so your blanket won't plug the fan airflow. Just bc you don't feel it getting hot, doesn't mean the components inside hasn't started melting.",

Occasionally one of these sarcastic remarks will gain legs and become the default response for any related request. It becomes second nature to reply without thinking. \n\nWell, on my ship this is exactly what happened.\n\nGiven that, three months after my discharge my first job out of the service was as a field service tech for a cash register company.\n\nOur \"uniform\" was khaki pants, collard short sleeve shirt, and a tie. And I was still sporting my Navy Regulation haircut. Basically if I went to any mid range retail establishment I was Karen bait because I was obviously \"the Manager\".\n\nSo I'm shopping at a large chain drug store looking for isopropyl alcohol (essential for cleaning printer ink off of cash register printers back in the day) and a woman comes up behind me and asks \"Can you tell me where the curling irons are?\"\n\nWithout missing a beat (more importantly without allowing my civilian filter to kick in) I say \"If they were up your a\\*\\* you'd know...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh poop. I did NOT just say that...\n\nI turn to look at her and see her in full surprised owl mode. Eyes the size of saucers and mouth wide open.\n\nI could feel my face turning red so I dropped my basket and booked it out of there before she had a chance to boot into Karen mode.\n\nTo this day 40 odd years later I have not been brave enough to set foot into that store again.",

    "body": "This just happened early this morning while everyone else in the house was asleep.\n\nI was fixing a PB&J sandwich and placed a jar of peanut butter in the microwave to warm it up. I like to warm up the peanut butter so it doesn’t destroy the bread while spreading it with a knife. I set the timer for 15 seconds, turn it on and turn around to do some additional prep work. All of a sudden I hear a loud buzzing and a bright light emanating from behind me. \n\nThis is no little flash, it is a brilliant light, enough to cast my shadow on the far wall of our dining room. I whip around and see the top edge of the plastic peanut butter jar strobing like an arc welder. I yank the door open to shut it off and that’s when I see the top edge of the jar still has a small remnant of the foil freshness seal stuck to the lip.\n\nThe foil has gotten so hot that it has melted the plastic jar and slightly charred it. The burnt plastic is giving off a heavy chemical smell and a thin haze of smoke has collected in the top of the microwave. I laugh to myself and pull the jar out of the microwave thinking it was a simple mistake and everything is OK. That’s when the smoke detector starts screaming it’s brains out.\n\nSince this is around 2AM it wakes my wife and adult daughter. My wife is an RN and starts her day at 6AM, so this was in the middle her of her sleep cycle. She is not happy. My daughter has recently changed jobs and this was the first morning she was reporting to her new position. She is not happy. We have four cats of various ages, the smoke alarm has startled them and now they are bouncing off the walls, the stairs and each other. They are not happy.\n\nSo I am standing on the stairs slapping at the smoke detector, the wife and daughter are yelling at me and the cats are ripping around the house like cats do when they are freaked out of their minds. I ended up breaking the mounting plate of the smoke detector but eventually got it silenced. The wife and daughter are glaring at me, one of the cats has pissed and evacuated their bowels on the floor of the kitchen and I have evil smelling plastic fumes I have to clear out of the kitchen. I am not happy. \n\nSo this has made me ‘persona non grata’ for the humans and probably the cats in the house. Just because of a little foil stuck to the top of the peanut butter jar. \n\nTL;DR - Peanut butter jar still had some foil from the freshness seal on the top. Microwave lit up the room as a result. Ended up waking the family during the middle of the night.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for the concern expressed about my misadventure. No, the peanut butter was not refrigerated, it’s a generic chunky brand that is fairly dense and needed a little encouragement to spread easily. It was nearly a full jar, 15 seconds barely raises the core temperature 10 degrees. Wife and daughter are speaking to me but cats are keeping their distance, maybe a benefit after all. Floor has been sanitized with isopropyl alcohol and fresh wax. Lessons learned about foil in the microwave, will double check the jar the next time (and there will be a next time).",

    "body": "So I work in a manufacturing company of about 35 people.  The other day, I came into work, made my cup of coffee and got to my work area.  I left my coffee on the workbench for about 10 minutes, as it was too hot to drink. When I returned to my work area I took a big sip of coffee and immediately noticed something wrong. My mouth instantly went dry and my sinuses burned.  I spit the coffee out, but had swallowed some.  A food manager saw this and asked me what happened. I told him something was wrong with my coffee, we both smelled it and guessed it was isopropyl alcohol.  He said I needed to go to upper management. I did and they contacted poison control but, I couldn't say for sure what I had consumed as we have  hundreds of chemicals in our shop.  They advised I drink water and monitor my condition.  What concerns me is this was the end of it.  I'm 90% sure I know who did it, but there is no real proof.  Management hasn't even talked to anybody. There is no way possible the chemical got in there accidently because my work area is far away from where these chemicals are kept.  I'm just really disappointed and unsatisfied with how this was handled. Should I, or is it possible to take this any further?\n\nEdit:  we do not have cameras at work.",

Allow the cup to air-dry, and save that too (there can sometimes be residual solid material in the cup). If you suspect a volatile liquid or solvent was used, it is especially important to seal the food/beverage quickly before the solvent evaporates (a glass bottle or jar is less likely to do this).

I waited 24 hours and reconnected the GPU with no luck. My onboard still worked and I connected an old GTX 780, so I do not believe its the mobo.\n\nWhat gives me hope is that today, 60+ hours later I decided to try the card again. It worked flawlessly for about 20 minutes before losing connection again. Also this applies to HDMI, display port, dvi, etc.\n\nI do not have a warranty or any proof of purchase so I am willing to try anything as I have no way of buying a GPU for the foreseeable future as i have 2 children with mouths to feed.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit 1: gpu worked for a little while last night then died again. Gtx 780 has been running fine since so I'm sure it's not mobo.\n\nEdit 2: the cat https://imgur.com/a/vR43Ksu",

I wouldn't buy anything more valuable or complicated than paperclips from Amazon. Over on a photography sub there was a guy who spent nearly $4000 on a Canon R5 camera body. The box shows up, he's all excited. He lifts up the box and it's suspiciously light. He opens the box.... and inside the packaging where a $3800 camera body should be, there is instead a clear plastic bag full of large, black, plastic insects. I wasn't even slightly surprised. I'm more surprised when there's actually an authentic product in the box. My idiot father keeps getting jerked around every month on orders. Shit shows up late. Shit doesn't show up at all. But that moron keeps giving them hundreds of dollars a month. I don't understand this thinking at all, and there are millions of idiots like him out there who think that is ok. That's why they keep treating people like this!!!!!",

    "body": "My first pair of Galaxy buds were great until the left bud started to become quieter than the right. I tried every fix that I could find on this subreddit or think of trying. Once I gave up on trying to fix them, I returned them and bought a new pair. Just recently, the left bud on the new pair became quieter than the right bud. To the point where the sound was almost inaudible.\n\nOne fix that made the volume increase a little on the new pair of Galaxy buds was no. 20 from this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/b5ccr9/megapost_a_list_of_random_tips_and_tricks_for/). Unfortunately, after some time had passed, the left bud became much quieter than the right again and the fix no longer worked. I even tried the fix multiple times throughout the course of 15 min.\n\nList of fixes that I tried with both pairs:\n\n* Resetting the Galaxy buds multiple times in About earbuds > Reset earbuds > Reset.\n\n* Making sure the Galaxy buds are using the latest software update.\n\n* Disabling/enabling ACC audio.\n\n* Forgetting the Galaxy buds in the bluetooth device details.\n\n* Disabling then enabling \"Phone calls\" and \"Media audio\" in the bluetooth device details.\n\n* If you go into Setting Developer Options and switch on \"Disable absolute volume\", it'll increase the volume a bit. This will help with low volume issues.\n\n* Clearing the data/cache of Galaxy Wearable and Galaxy Buds Plugin. If that doesn't work, try reinstalling both of the applications.\n\n* Removing the ear tip, using 70% isopropyl alcohol to clean the small perforated metal cover, then playing media at 100% volume/using the \"Find my Earbuds\" feature to try to remove possibly debris. Also, try cleaning the black proximity sensor and metal contacts.\n\n* If experiencing significant volume loss on one or both sides of the buds, place the buds on a table then use the find my buds feature for about 30 seconds then the level should be the same. If that doesn't work, then completely drain both buds then fully recharge in case.\n\n* Galaxy Buds and your phone have separate volume and to Increase/Decrease the volume of your buds, set up tap and hold from the GW app to Increase/Decrease volume.\n\n* Reset the buds, restart the phone, then reconnect to them.\n\nI'm positive that I'm not suffering from hearing loss because the left bud is still very quiet when I put it in my right ear and the right bud is at normal volume level when I put it in my left ear.\n\nFor this issue to occur twice with two of the same product is extremely disappointing. It was very frustrating for this issue to arise the first time. Now that it has happened a second time, I'm going to find a new pair of wireless earbuds if I can't find a fix.\n\nEdit: One highly **effective solution** can be found from u/AlphaTrumpsfapping’s comment:\n\n>\tIts debris from your ear inside the bud. Take your Ear Buds, play music on full volume and run the find my earbuds feature. I took a q-tip, dipped it in isopropyl alcohol (70% trying to not ruin the plastic bits) and rubbed it a bit all over the metal grate and generally around it with the “find my earbuds” was running. I rubbed the metal grating and dipped new q-tips 5 times while the “find my earbuds” was running and blasting music on full volume. It broke up what ever was in there and now its back to maximum volume!\n\nOr another (yet disgusting) **effective solution** was commented by, u/qsebring393.\n\n>\tI know it sounds gross, but I just sucked on the metal grate tip while it was playing the find my buds and it went right back to normal.\n\nEdit2: Lol 4 years later and this same very post is still getting comments about success. Great to see this post helping many.\n\nEdit3: Lol now 5 years later and still getting success comments. And to think I had this post drafted for a bit and almost didn’t post it (was getting lazy and was late to posting it + was still writing the post in the process). So cool to see such an old post still helping bud users to this day.",

Let's make it as accurate as possible.\n\nHi! I'm new to PC Building, having only ever built one PC in my lifetime, so I got curious about knowing what I should do for maintenance of my fancy-ass 1050Ti and Ryzen 5-1600 powered 8GB system! I looked it up here, and there's a bunch of posts but I couldn't really find a central guide for it. So I thought I'd make one, with links to all relevant pages/or comments from other posts, or even other posts directly. This is mainly for my own convenience in future, but also hopefully it might answer most, if not all, questions for maintenance.\n\nThe guide will be structured as follows:\n\n1. Hardware (which includes subtopics as MoBo, GPU, RAM, Case, etc.)\n2. OS\n3. Software\n4. General Tips\n\n**Topics** will be bolded and *Subtopics* will be italicized. Time interval for performing that specific maintenance procedure will be written below the text box as a quote. With that out of the way, let's get started with...\n\n>I've decided to cordon off OS as a separate section apart from Software, as it has many subcategories of it's own.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Hardware**\n\n*General* \\- Dusting your PC regularly can ensure that your temperatures remain low for all components, as well as reduce the chances of your fans clogging up. On average, you should be expected to do this around once or twice a year. In no way however does dust potentially short your components. According to [this post](https://superuser.com/questions/480542/can-dust-cause-damage-to-my-motherboard) on Stack Exchange, unless in very specific conditions, generally the biggest damage dust can do is cause an overheat. Please keep in mind however, if you have pets close by, smoke, or vape (which can attach to dust and make it potentially conductive, thereby shorting, one of the specific conditions I mentioned earlier), you may want to clean it more frequently. For AIO Systems, dust the radiator. (Thanks /u/mmosarecool !)\n\nDusting can be completed with a can of compressed air, and ensure that your case fans do not spin when dusting them.\n\n\"Maintenance isn’t so bad if you keep up with it. I vape inside my rec room and it gets dusty often. I clean out my pc and peripherals once a month. Keyboards can gather so much dust; I even found my ball for my nose piercing one time.\" - /u/Felicats\n\n>6-12 months once, more if dusty room/pets/smoke/vape\n\n*Processor* \\- The processor is arguably the brain of the computer, and it is vital that you ensure it's kept running cool. Besides dusting, there's also the thermal paste to be aware of. A good rule of thumb is to [monitor your CPU's temperatures](https://www.techspot.com/community/topics/how-often-should-i-replace-my-thermal-paste.178411/) to see if it's overheating. If it is, and you can be sure that it's not because your CPU cooler is defective/malfunctioning, then reapplying thermal paste is a good idea. A good utility for this would be [Core Temp](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/). I'd suggest after first boot to take note of the temps you're getting after an average use session (gaming/editing/browsing/etc) and see if it changes after about 3-6 months. You can also compare your temperatures with that of others on the net, but bear in mind ambient temperature can raise or lower the temperatures. And of course, reapply your thermal paste if you remove your cooler. Bear in mind once again you may be getting higher temperatures due to a faulty/unplugged fan, so check that before blaming the paste, as it's meant to last a good long while. (Thanks, /u/mmosarecool !)(Again!)\n\nTo reapply thermal paste, remove your CPU cooler, dab some 91% Isopropyl Alcohol on a coffee filter paper, and clean the surface of both your processor and your CPU cooler until there's no trace of the thermal paste left. Then reapply your thermal paste in whatever manner you're familiar with, reassemble the cooler, and you're done.\n\n>To be done when CPU Temperatures are high or you experience thermal throttling. Use [Core Temp](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/) to monitor temps.\n\n*GPU* \\- In general, there's not much maintenance to do for the GPU besides your usual dusting. There can be something done on the driver side, but that will be covered later in this guide.\n\n>Refer to *General*\n\n*RAM* \\- Same as GPU\n\n>Refer to *General*\n\n*PSU* \\- General cleaning also applies to the PSU\n\n>Refer to *General*\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**OS**\n\n*Registry* \\- Most importantly, do NOT use Registry Cleaners and CCleaner or apps like those. The Windows Registry is extremely sensitive to modification, and blindly deleting what a registry cleaner tells you to may cause irreparable or hard to repair damage to your system. Seriously, [don't use a registry cleaner](https://blog.ipswitch.com/should-you-use-a-registry-cleaner-like-ccleaner). Besides, it's not like the days of yore when Windows' registry was not as optimised as it was today. This is one area you should leave as is.\n\n>DON'T\n\n*Temp/Junk files* \\- Feel free to delete these at will. It's [Completely safe](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files-winpc/deleting-temporary-files-in-win-10-safe/5701e1cd-2c16-4903-8234-7df6a00902cf). You can use Windows' Built in Disk Cleanup utility or navigate to the temp folder by hitting Win+R to open the \"Run\" window and typing in \"%temp%\" without quotes, then selecting all the files and deleting it. [Check it here](https://www.intowindows.com/how-to-safely-delete-temporary-files-in-windows-10/). You can also use [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/) to clear up other junk, like browser caches and things like that. (Thanks /u/mmosarecool !)\n\n>Every few months or so, especially if you're noticing you're running out of space\n\n*Defragmenting* \\- Check this [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/5976424/what-is-defragging-and-do-i-need-to-do-it-to-my-computer) post for further explanation, but basically on a HDD, sometimes data can be written to separate sections of the drive, splitting it up and causing the time taken to read the data to be even longer. Defragmenting repositions the data blocks to be closer to each other, improving read times. Windows generally takes care of this automatically, but you can get it to do it anytime by going to (On Windows 10) Start and searching \"Defrag\". The Defragment and Optimize Drives utility should open up, then hit Optimize. you can also modify the frequency at which Windows does the optimization automatically. Please note, if you use an SSD, it's generally a bad idea to defragment, as the way it stores and reads data is different from a HDD.\n\n\"Since Windows 8 on, the OS won't even let you defragment SSDs, hence why it says \"optimize\". It just runs a TRIM command instead.\" - /u/redrubberpenguin\n\n>Done automatically, but feel free to do so once in awhile\n\n*Scheduled OS Backups* \\- Look, things can go wrong, so why not take a precaution? Set up a scheduled OS partition backup using software recommended by /u/MikeyFlipped (Thanks!), which is [Veeam](https://www.veeam.com/virtual-machine-backup-solution-free.html) and always have peace of mind should anything ever happen to your OS. /u/EncoreBlade also recommends [Macrium Reflect Free](https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree) and according to him, \"It works very similarly to macOS Time Machine software.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Software**\n\n*Antivirus* \\- A great way to feel secure, there's plenty of legitimate and free antivirus to install to keep your PC clean. In fact, Windows comes with Windows Defender pre-installed, and it's a far cry from how ineffective it was in the past. If you're still worried, BitDefender is a good alternative. After the first install, it should run automatically in the background and keep you safe.\n\n*Startup* \\- Open your Task Manager and you should see a tab called startup. Click on it and you should see a list of programs. These are all applications that can run on startup. Generally, game clients like Steam and Antivirus Software would be here. Reducing the number of startup apps will actually have a noticeable improvement on boot times, especially on a HDD. As a general rule of thumb, software like NVidia or AMD driver software and Logitech Software or Razer Synapse can be left to run on startup, as well as AV Software. On my own PC, I only have three startup apps, SoundSwitch, Logitech Gaming Framework, and ObjectDock. Everything else like Discord and Steam I run manually.\n\n*Drivers* \\- This is mainly focused on GPU drivers because, well, yeah. Apps like GeForce Experience can keep the drivers up to date but still require your go ahead to install them. You can also download them manually from [their website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/). Once in awhile, it may be a good idea to do a thorough cleaning and uninstall of your drivers. This can be done with Wagnard's [Display Driver Uninstaller](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/). It handles everything automatically, and recommends booting into Safe Mode to do a proper job. This is not extremely necessary however, unless you are facing problems related to drivers, which you should only diagnose if your symptoms are similar to those someone else is experiencing and the cause is verified to be drivers.\n\nFor other drivers, let Windows handle it. \n\nCheck for GPU Driver Updates at least once a month on the official website of your GPU brand to stay up to date. Please also bear in mind, occasionally the latest drivers may cause issues with game performance, and sticking with a slightly older driver may actually provide better performance, [as was the case with Monster Hunter World](https://steamcommunity.com/app/582010/discussions/0/1745594817445825673/).\n\n>Check monthly for updates to driver software\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**General Tips**\n\nKeep data you want to keep on your non-OS drive - /u/zeropaladn\n\nIf you think there is something wrong in the Windows open Command Prompt and write\n\"sfc /scannow\", without quotes. It will scan your protected system files and replace them with a cached copy - /u/freakingcold\n\nAlong with \"use sfc /scannow\" I would also add do the \"chkdsk C: /r\" command to scan and (hopefully) fix hard drive issues. - /u/The-Toon\n\nDon't keep your PC on the carpet or carpeted floor to avoid dust bunnies in your case. Ensure your case fans don't pull air from the bottom. - /u/Orfez\n\n\"If you're not keen on dusting inside your PC every 6 months or are in a really dusty environment, invest in some fan filters. After adding filters I went from needing to dust every 6 months to once every year - year and a half. I could probably get a way with every 2 years.\" - /u/Kyvalmaezar\n\nIf you'd like to know about GPU thermal paste replacement, check out [this guide](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/10418-how-to-change-your-gpus-thermal-paste-with-pictures/) by LTT on how to do it. I did not include it in the main body of the guide as it's rarely brought up as compared to CPU Thermal Paste Replacement however, but if you feel your card is getting too hot and you've already dusted it and checked the drivers, this might be what you have to do. Thanks /u/theWinterDojer ! (BTW, he's got a great guide of his own as well! [Check it out here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7mn388/so_you_finished_building_your_pc_now_what/)\n\n\"On the subject of startup programs, the other place not to forget about is Task Scheduler. This is usually where things like Google Updates and nVidia Telemetry tasks are run at startup. Again, this might be fine for most people, but if you really want the fastest startups then possibly worth considering disabling some of those too.\" - /u/88JM\n\n\"I would add that it may be a good idea to clean \"old windows installations\" with disk cleanup. I've seen 40+GB of files just sitting on the OS drive from system updates.\" - /u/AlbinoPanther5\n\n\"You should always read line by line what you're choosing for those apps to clean. If you're like me and you have your browser set to reopen your tabs from last time, do not allow it to clean \"Session\", or you will lose all those tabs. Might be 3, might be 30.\" - /u/Computermaster\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredits (if not mentioned above)\n\n/u/Kryzm for suggesting changing to coffee filter paper in Processor\n\n/u/SolidBladez for pointing me to the original source for DDU. Link in the post has been changed accordingly.\n\nAnd that's it! If you ever need to refer to PC Maintenance, I hope this guide will help you. Perhaps in future I'll add a custom loop maintenance section once I have someone willing to help me with it, but this should be enough to get you started on an air-cooled/AIO system.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MAJOR EDITS**\n*Such as content removal or entire new sections done after posting*\n\nRemoved the statement that quoted people saying to change it every 6-12 months as nobody seemed to see the actual recommendation, which is to change it only when facing temperature issues not caused by a faulty cooler.",

Many times however, especially in regards to user account issues, or programs failing to install(most commonly for us, logmein) a quick run of CCleaner regfix saves time and achieves the desired results.\n\nWindows takes like 5 minutes to install now, and fucking the registry should not ever hurt your important data unless you have no way to access it without the windows install it is associated with.\n\nJust my two cents, the rest of the guide is great.",

    "body": "After noticing GDDR6X junction temperatures approaching 100C while gaming, I opened up my Zotac RTX 3080 Trinity OC today to replace the VRAM thermal pads. I’ve had to replace leaky, oily thermal pads on a couple different GPUs in the past, but nothing ever like this.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FHEGG75](https://imgur.com/a/FHEGG75)\n\nThis is my first (and probably last) Zotac card. I’m still not quite sure exactly what this is, but it seems like the thermal pads have literally started to disintegrate. Both the pads located on the GDDR6X modules and the backplate melted all over the place. It was a horrible mess, and I must’ve used at least 50 q-tips soaked in isopropyl alcohol in the attempt to clean up the residue. But I wasn’t able to get all of it even after an hour of picking away at it.\n\nI’ve had this 3080 for less than a month, and there’s no way that the thermal pads should be in this condition already. The GPU is installed in a high-airflow case with plenty of fans. I know GDDR6X temperature issues aren’t unique to Zotac products, but these thermal pads are simply inexcusable. Shame on them for choosing not to spend the extra 50 cents for non-garbage components.\n\nIf you have a Zotac RTX 3000-series card, i highly recommend you inspect the thermal pads and replace them ASAP. I used 2.0mm ~~Arctic~~ Fujipoly thermal pads (6 W/mK) for the VRAM, and double-stacked 1.5mm Arctic pads for the backplate. Memory junction temperatures have fallen by 12-15 degrees depending on the game.  \n\n*Edit (April 12, 2021): A lot of people have messaged me asking for thermal pad advice, so I'll just paste what I wrote to someone else here.* \n\n*In terms of quantity needed, you don't need a whole lot for a one-time replacement, just enough to cover the VRAM modules on both sides. I believe each 1GB module is 12x14 mm and there are ten of them. At the time, I couldn't find 3.0mm thermal pads (they are relatively expensive and harder to find), so I just stuck two 1.5mm pads together for the backplate.*\n\n*I bought a 145x145x1.5mm Arctic sheet + 150x100x2mm Fujipoly sheet. IMO, it doesn't really matter what brand you get, although the Gelid and Thermal Grizzly pads are generally considered to be the best enthusiast pads available. I would just go for something that's reasonably priced in terms of $/sq. mm.*",

[Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**\n\nGPU: Radeon R9 280\n\nCPU: Intel i7 4790k\n\nMobo: Gigabyte Z97MX\n\n**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**\n\nFirst time posting on reddit, since I'm old I guess, so I apologize if this post is in the wrong area. For a couple of years now, my 18 year old cat has made it known that she's slowly dying by vomiting at intermittent amounts, depending on what type of cat food is used. My PC has dual exhaust vents on the top of the tower, which she often perches on, because cats are bad people. About a week ago, she got on top of the tower while I wasn't paying attention, and vomited all over, which of course leaked down into the vents and landed onto the GPU, immediately causing my PC to black screen. I cleaned it the next day with some 91% isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs, and that fixed the card enough where I am able to browse the internet without issue. \n\nNow that the long preamble is finished, my issue is that if I attempt to play any video game that causes the GPU to reach about 70 Celsius, shortly thereafter the card will give up and shut down, forcing me to manually restart my PC. It sits at around 50 Celsius when just doing normal browsing, and the CPU doesn't really go above 40-50 Celsius either. I'm something of a pleb when it comes to PC components, I know just enough to know what to put where, so I'm a bit stumped as to why this card appears to be only partially operational. Give it to me straight, doc. Do I need to pull the plug on this addled graphics card, and probably the cat too?\n\n**EDIT**: I didn't want to make the initial post long, so I glossed over some things, but looking at this long ass comment thread, I should probably clarify in places. The cat hasn't been a vomit machine for the past couple of years, but it has been an issue. We were going to put it down when this issue first came at hand because she was doing it almost daily, by the third day she looked like a walking corpse and it was time for a potentially final visit to the vet. However, the vet suggested changing her food to a wet food/dry food combination first, and to experiment with that, and surprisingly, we found a setup that severely mitigated the vomiting to about twice a month. To make an example of the recovery, we placed one of those gates to our second floor that people use to keep their equally barfy babies from climbing up stairs, and the smug little thing effortlessly vaults over it to this day. So we've reached a bit of an impasse where if she's a happy cat 95% of the time, should we send her to be put down just because 5% is devoted to uncomfortable vomiting? Granted after this, I am leaning towards a yes myself. And since people asked, this is the culprit in question: https://i.imgur.com/kTZwIYr.jpg\n\nAs for the GPU, because of the placement of the exhaust vent, the vomit landed on the edge of the card. I don't have a picture of it with vomit, because it was like two in the morning when it happened, and the last thing on my mind was taking selfies with cat puke, but here is the affected area all the same: https://i.imgur.com/nhYDM8N.jpg \nThe crevasse is probably going to be the bane of my existence, as it's a lovely stench of isopropyl and stale cat vomit, so I suppose I will be taking a crash course in taking apart a GPU to deep clean. Thank you to everyone who has given troubleshooting suggestions, I have thermal paste on the way.\n",

    "body": "General content warning for descriptions of dead animals, body-parts, and gore. All links state whether there’s any pictures of deads or gore (I've included barely any! Only one gore to demonstrate).\n\nTaxidermy is more well known, but this is also part of the Vulture Culture hobby (which includes taxidermy, and more). The subject today is wet specimens – preservation in jars.\n\nThis event happened over a year ago, and came to be known as ‘Nipplegate’. It’ll become clear why.\n\nKey piece of knowledge necessary to understand:\n\n* Correct way to do wet specimens is injecting with formalin (formaldehyde solution) to 'fix' it, *then* placing in a jar of isopropyl alcohol. This process takes weeks or months, and causes rigidity to the specimen. Formalin is corrosive and highly toxic, particularly if inhaled.\n* Incorrect way is just using isopropyl alcohol. The specimen continues to rot from the inside, so it initially looks good but before long becomes a corpse brew.\n\n**UNCOVERING THE SCAM**\n\nIt began with a preserved piglet in a jar [[no deads, no gore](https://imgur.com/a/dP8miTC)]. On arrival, it was found to smell, leak blood, and all the packaging was covered in a brown liquid. The buyer wrote a negative review in a Taxidermy hobby group, and crucially, demonstrated how squishy the pig was. Suspicions arose that the piglet had just been stuffed in a jar of iso (without being fixed with formalin); i.e. not one accidental bad job, but intentionally lying.\n\nThe taxidermist claimed to have had the piglet for 4 months, but the seller of the raw piglet was contacted – nope, only a matter of weeks. Confirmed lie.\n\nThen, a break in the case… A particularly recognisable piece was spotted: a pig’s foot with ‘beautiful’ tattoo’d across it. The tattooing post was in a different Vulture Culture hobbyist group, and the tattoo artist came across groups to confirm – the foot was raw, and the scammer was selling it on within ***days***. [[dead animal, but no gore](https://imgur.com/2OFpE0P)] At a high price, too - bought for £8 inc. postage, chuck it in a jar and sell for £45!\n\n**BEGINNING OF THE ERUPTION**\n\nSomething to know about Vulture Culture people: they typically love animals, to the extent that they often treat a dead one with the same level of deference that you would a beloved deceased pet. This isn’t seen as just a wastage of materials and money, but as disrespectful to the animal in question, and very personal.\n\nAll hell broke loose as people went through her instagram, trying to locate the buyers to warn them. Some buyers were in the hobbyist groups themselves, and checked their own jars to find that the animals were rotting away. It was a horror show, checking the pretty animals to find that they’ve begun spewing out gunge.\n\nSellers also started realising that she had also been taking advantage of their kindness to get things for cheap or free, only to immediately sell them for a high price. [[dead animal, but no gore](https://imgur.com/CJGqviQ)]\n\nThe scammer blocked some. She threatened to contact the police. She posted around places trying to claim it was a single incident. [[no deads, no gore](https://imgur.com/UZoaq76)] One buyer who had been contacted by the hobbyists had spent £400 total for various items e.g. a squirrel which now had (quote) “brains coming out its nose” [[cw: gore](https://imgur.com/FTQGG6s)]. She drove to the scammer's house for a refund – and once there, someone else (scammer's Mum?) answered the door - and only gave her a £100 refund! [[no deads, no gore](https://imgur.com/sEMEuDb)]\n\nSome buyers would never be found; an upsetting reality when it was discovered quite how many wet specimens were commissions of people’s pets. Can you imagine someone’s first impressions of this hobby being to watch Fluffy decompose on the mantlepiece?\n\n**NIPPLES**\n\nBut then, something else was found on her shop page.\n\nTwo naff-looking vials, each containing a human nipple (with brightly coloured areolas).\n\nOh dear.\n\n[Note: I won’t share a picture, as I don’t believe it’s my right to put another person’s body-parts here. I can show more to a mod if fact-checking is needed.]\n\nFirstly, why are there nipples? Secondly, whose nipples are they? Thirdly, *why are there nipples*?? This was now a race against time – could the owner of the nipples be contacted before his very self decomposed in front of him?\n\nWhilst some were working on the quest to free the nipples, others had found a livestream of her ‘processing’ said nipples. No safety equipment; either she hated her lungs, or wasn’t using formalin.\n\nThe guy they belonged to wasn’t part of these hobbies at all, but fortunately he did have some public presence as part of another community – body-modification. He had gone beyond tattooing to getting his nipples removed entirely. And so, thanks to his public online presence, there was the route for contact. Not only was he contacted, but he was brought into the group to be shown specifically what the concerns were. He greeted with curiosity, as well as multiple (rather excited) offers to help him with his nipple predicament. Linked are my two favourite comments. [[no deads, no gore](https://imgur.com/e3boAQl)]\n\nTurned out that he hadn’t even received the nipples back yet (the scammer had ‘completed’ the nipples, but was seemingly in no rush to send them home). Informed and convinced, he contacted her – he wanted his nipples NOW.\n\n**OUTCOMES**\n\nThe bodymodder:\n\n* He retrieved his nipples.\n* General opinion was that because nipples are small and it hadn't been tooo long, they should be still be ok, and to get them fixed in formalin properly. i.e. SUCCESS.\n\nScam-taxidermist:\n\n* End credits. She was an instant pariah; you cannot survive long in a niche hobby as a scammer.\n* Nipplegate has been permanently attached to her name, both in the hobby groups and in some public posts.\n* She briefly attempted to remain up with a changed name, but her facebook, instagram, and etsy pages soon closed and have never reopened.\n\nThe animals:\n\n* The piglet was taken in by someone else to be buried in a rot box (not the ground, in case there were toxic chemicals).\n* Some smaller animals were still salvageable, and fixed by other taxidermists.\n\nThe hobby:\n\n* It is an event marked in people’s memories, such as having a 1 year Nipplegate anniversary post. \n* The formalin v.s. iso-only wet specimen argument is now firmly established, with “remember Nipplegate” quickly shutting down anyone else thinking to take shortcuts.\n* No continuing drama happened. Seems that the scammer was chased out so thoroughly that the drama ended.",

Computer still not working. \n\nThen I think, maybe I’ll just plug my laptop into the monitor to rule that out, even though it was working fine that morning… nothing. It was the bloody monitor. I plugged the PC into my tv and that bad bitch booted perfectly. \n\nI took the monitor back and got a new, slightly better one because the one I had was no longer in stock. Cheers JBhifi. I have some speakers coming to match the vibe also, I can’t wait until it’s all set up. I don’t think I’m cut out for the PC building world but I’m very happy with how my setup looks now. :) ",

I moved to other stores, same thing, online same.\n\nI had to close project and deliver them to clients, summing up delay on deliveries, so i was like okay, lets repair it, is a lot of money, but is the only thing to do\n\nI went to the repair shop, explained the situation, the guy told me they can replace the entire logic board.

My lovely sunflowers, borage, lavender, thyme, and basil have been thriving. My cucumbers succumbered to the little beasts before I figured this out and can’t help but wonder if this would have worked on them…\n\nAll I did was take a “triple volume” squirt bottle (basically a squirt bottle that produces a squirt with *velocity*, fill it with water, enough isopropyl alcohol to still gag  when full, and a squeeze of dawn dish soap. I then would remove the plant (yes a hydroponic, but if you can invert a potted plant safely, this can still work), spray outside all of the leaves and stalks violently, then place inverted in a bucket full of water for an hour. I then remove, drip dry, do NOT remove any soap or excess water and let dry. This is in a full sun and light setup, so they tend to dry quickly anyway for me.\n\nThis has removed my mite infestations. I did this every 3 days for 2 weeks and they have yet to re-infest. \n\nJust thought I’d share to those of you who find spider mites/webbing/infestations that you think are world-ending—you can beat them!\n",

But here is what you would want to do if you don't want to go that route.\n\nYou can try to take apart your entire pc and look for any other affected areas and clean them. If there was even a single drop on the PSU, please replace it alongside your gpu (btw if you end up replacing the PSU please do not re-use the same cables from the old PSU even if they are the same brand). If you want, you can try taking apart the gpu and fully clean it from the inside, but I doubt that will fix it but might as well give it a shot. \n\nIf after replacing the gpu and you have your PC running but you run into issues like blue screens, wifi issues, lan cable issues, usb issues, and undetected drives, you might also need to replace the motherboard.\n\nBest of luck with fixing your PC!",

    "body": "Just got a new OLED Switch, and wanted to apply a screen protector for obvious reasons. Unfortunately, I suck at getting them on without capturing any dust or hair or anything underneath. On my 2017 V1 Switch, there there was a tiny speck that bothered the heck out of me for years whenever I played it handheld. My will to save money only *just* beat out my desire for a perfect screen.\n\nBut now, six years later, I'm a grad student with access to a class 1000 cleanroom, so I decided to make it perfect. A cleanroom is a special research/manufacturing room with like 2/3 of both the floor and ceiling covered with special industrial air filters. Unlike your standard office space, which will have about 1 million dust particles (defined as measuring at least 0.5 µm in size) per cubic foot, class 1000 cleanroom will only have 1000 particles/ft\\^3.\n\nSo I went to the cleanroom at 7:30 AM in the morning with no one else in the building. I used the provided stickers to remove the dust, some IPA (isopropyl alcohol) to wipe down the screen, and special cleanroom wipes to clear any remaining residue. Then I used a plastic guide to perfectly align the screen and plopped it in.\n\nThree tries later I finally got one down without any dust! (until I inevitably see on tiny little spec like a week from now and debate going through this again) XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56o1qglgz0xa1.jpg?width=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc12e1e82eb85faec05d5952fa9d5718ac46e071\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/es9gjflgz0xa1.jpg?width=1884&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85add071a73076d4f6bffe71e8b1abb9efc4957f",

I have flawlessly instald screen protectos with no dust in a normal room. \n\nA couple of protips.\n1. When you are wiping the screen down you want to be careful not to wipe it to much as you can staticly charge the screen. Use some alcohol (i tend you hanf sanitizer though some like the aloe ones csn leavr residue) and get it nice and clean and get a cloth that spans across the screen  completely then pull it across the rest of the way in one firm stroke. After this you basicly have 30 to 45 second before dust settles and you have to do it again so be swift.  \n\nAddionsl Protip \n If you have it Compressed air is a great way to remove dust and counter act the staic charge on the screen that attracts dust after cleaning it. \n\n2. if your screen protector doesnt have a guide or a system for instal peel of a small amount of the protetor film and fold it towards the rest of the protector film exposing about 3/4s an inch of adhesive then line it up with the device screen\nonce lined up being careful not to touch the screen lift slightly and reach your hand under the protector making sure it doesnt move and pull that film straight out the oppsite side. Its ok if the film slides on the screen and you pull it out as long as your fingers dont touch the screen. \n\nWith any luck your done however sometime with everything being perfect some dust can still get underneath which bring me to\n\n3. ULTIMATE TECHNIQUE- DUST REMOVAL \nnote this can only be done directly after instal as the adhesive on most protector eventually sets. \n     leaving the previously installed screen protector on  peel the corner of the screen protector from the device leaving as much attached as you can nearest your pieces of dust take a piece of scotch tape being sure the leading piece has no finger prints place in under the screen protector stick side down slide it over the dust push it on and then pulling left the right on the tape remove it.  Occasionally a piece of dust gets stuck to the adhesive of the screen protector and you will have to flip it. This is difficult so take your time. A word of caution it is possible to reintroduce additional dust underneath but the idea is by keeping it mostly close to the screen you can remove dust without adding dust. \nYou MUST use standard office sticky tape. The adhesive is just right and dosnt stick to hard or deposit sticky stuff or pull sticky stuff from the protector.  Any Included dust removal stickers are to tacky for this.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps for future instals.",

It's harder to play in direct sunlight due to this.\n\nMost protectors also don't have good or any oleophobic coating at all so the whole screen gets covered in an oil rainbow with just a few touches.

I then turned it on and it wouldn’t stay powered up for more than two minutes, shutting itself down. \n\nPer some suggestions I received here, I took action. I opened up the Xbox and removed the hard drive and disc reader. I left the fan in there because I didn’t want to mess with the x-clip. I proceeded to blow it out with some compressed air as it was pretty dusty. After that I cleaned everything I could see with 91% isopropyl alcohol on q-tips. Sprayed a small amount of isopropyl down into the fan area as I couldn’t get a q-tip there. \n\nAfter cleaning, I let it sit by my wood pellet stove and set a fan in front of it. Stayed like this for two and half days. Blew out with compressed air again to rid of the settled dust. Put it all back together and fired her up. Works flawlessly and sounds normal. \n\nThanks all. \n\nTL;DR : Xbox would not stay on after spilling water on it. Opened up, cleaned with 91% isopropyl alcohol and compressed air, dried out for 2.5 days in front of fan and wood pellet stove. Works flawlessly. \n\nEdit: Added % of isopropyl alcohol ",

Thank god the seam didn’t just totally blow, and I caught it pretty quickly and was able to save my hardwood floor and the fish (they lived in a bucket for a few days until I got a new tank). Last time I ever keep a fish tank for more than 5 years without replacing it, or keep one through a move. The TV was fine, but the Xbox was literally sitting in a puddle of fish water 😱 so it smelled delightful and when I tipped it over, at least a cup of water poured out of the disk drive. Urk.\n\nI just tipped it upside down over towels and put a fan on it for a good few days, rotating it so it fully drained and air was blowing into it from different angles. I was afraid to mess with it too much since water and electronics don’t mix and I was pregnant at the time so I really didn’t want any kind of shock.  But fortunately after a week of drying, it started working again. Over a year and a half later, it is still working perfectly 😊 fingers crossed now that you fixed yours it will stay working for you for a long time! \n\nI was pretty impressed with how well it handled having literally more than a gallon poured almost directly onto it lol.",

I'd be willing to bet it's probably also better for the environment than what's in wasp spray and won't leave residue on your walls because it evaporates so quickly.\n\nAlcohol CAN damage some surfaces, like wall paint, when in constant contact. It doesn't do so aggressively though, so just be sensible with your use of it.\n\nJust buy a spray bottle with an adjustable nozzle to allow for thin stream sprays for better reach and you're golden.",

It has fostered the for-profit LTC industry despite staggering greed and incompetence due to the political connections between that industry and current govt.

We should be in a real lockdown.  Big box stores should only be selling food and nothing else.

    "body": "***http://choosemypc.net/buildguide/ FOR EASIER READING***\n\n*If there is anything missing, needs elaborating on or changing please comment below! On a guide as long as this there are bound to be mistakes.*\n\n*I will be expanding on this guide over time before the end of the competition, possibly to include peripherals etc*\n\n---\n\n**Building a Gaming PC**\n\n---\n\nWell, this is a rather generic guide, you say. You would be right there. And it probably won't be relevant for long until it needs updating, as I will be talking in terms of specific parts and narrowing your choices down. Ive been meaning to write it for a while, but with the 100k subscriber competition on /r/buildapc going on I may as well do it now and have a chance of winning. Good luck to you all if you are entering.\n\nIt can be rather intimidating to have a whole pcpartpicker list of CPUs, all slightly different and with different stats - but actually 90% of the products can be discarded straight away as they won't be relevant to your uses. Most people end up choosing a cookie cutter build, which isn't necessarily wrong but you haven't truly understood why that processor should be chosen above all the others. I hope to give some background knowledge to the various viable part choices, at least for gaming PCs.\n\nThe first thing you will want to consider is the *budget*, of course. Spending more will always net you more performance in one way or another. Whether you can see the increase in performance depends on your monitors! On a standard 1080p 60Hz monitor which most people use, there is a limit to the amount of graphical power needed to get 60fps in every game on max settings. You can always turn ridiculous antialiasing settings on etc but I would say that a 7970 is all you currently need with a standard monitor and you will be set.\n\n---\n\n**CPUs**\n\n---\n\n**[A8-5600K](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-ad560kwohjbox)/[A10-5800K](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-ad580kwohjbox)** For the very low budgets, where you can't even afford a decent video card along with a CPU, youll want to be looking at an APU. These chips have very good integrated graphics comparable with a low end discrete video card and will be able to handle your basic gaming needs (at 30fps and 720p for instance) just fine. These are a good choice for a HTPC or console alternative build too. The A8-5600K and A10-5800K are the current newest APUs in the lineup, on the FM2 socket.\n\n**[G630](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80623g630)/[G850](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80623g850)** Now an APU build can easily go up in price until you can get an Intel Pentium G630 processor and a low end GPU like a 7770. At that point, you definitely want to be going for a discrete GPU as it will perform much better even with the relatively poor performing CPU. Look at the Pentium G630/G850 as choices around this area, as they are priced better than the incremental steps around them (620/840 etc)\n\n**[FX-6300](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-fd6300wmhkbox)/[i3-3220](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i33220)** Heres where the \"good\" category gaming builds come in where you can start to enjoy 60fps @ 1080p in most games. At this price point there is the i3-3220 and FX-6300 from Intel and AMD respectively. At the moment these are very competitively priced and either is a good choice, but personally I would go for the FX-6300. It is ~2-5% worse in gaming performance yet 30% better for heavily multithreaded tasks. You also get overclocking should you decide to in the future. I wouldn't recommend buying a cooler from the start, as often you spend as much combined that you could get an i5-3470 for the same price.\n\n**[i5-3470](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i53470)** Not overclocking? Want to spend more on the GPU? This is a very good choice of CPU for a mid-high end gaming rig. More performance than you will need for general gaming so you are set for quite a while to come, as well as being able to get good performance in more CPU intensive games. You also save a ton of money by not overclocking as you can get a cheaper motherboard and don't have to pay for the cooler. If you 'might' overclock 'in the future' I would actually advise you just skip out on it and spend the money on graphics.\n\n**[i5-3570k](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80637i53570k)** A /r/buildapc favourite right here. For good reason too. I see it recommended a little too much for people who clearly have no interest in overclocking though. If you do want to overclock, and are willing to push the CPU as far as it will go (or if you have the budget to buy a 7970 already and want to spend a little more in this area) then the i5-3570k is the choice for you.\n\n**[i7-3820](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80619i73820)** Why skip the i7-3770k? Well [Ive discussed this topic in a lot of detail here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/164qx0/psa_i73820_the_x79_chipset_and_gaming/) so I won't go into it. The only benefit of an i7-3770k over an i5-3570k is the hyperthreading which games don't take advantage of, whereas with the 3820 you get extra PCIe lanes for dual card setups.\n\n**[FX-8350](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-fd8350frhkbox)** sits below the i5 in terms of gaming performance but is very good for streaming and multi threaded tasks where the extra cores come in handy. Just don't bring up Logan's video to use in an argument for it :D\n\n---\n\n**CPU Coolers**\n\n---\n\nNot overclocking? Don't want insane quiet operation? **Use the stock cooler**. The exception to this is the i7-3820 - as it is an enthusiast CPU there is no stock cooler bundled with it.\n\nFor moderate overclocking a [**Cooler Master 212 Evo**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-cpu-cooler-rr212e20pkr1) will do you proud, but it is pretty loud as far as aftermarket CPU coolers go. That being said the performance for the money is absolutely fantastic.\n\nIf you really want to push things and already have a higher end CPU selected, go for a really high end air cooler. These are huge, but will fit in 99% of mid tower cases just fine. Some options are the [**Phanteks PH-TC14PE**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/phanteks-cpu-cooler-phtc14pe), the [**Noctua NH-D14**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/noctua-cpu-cooler-nhd14) and the **Thermalrite True Spirit 140**.\n\nIf the aim is silence over performance, I would recommend the [**Gelid Tranquilo**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gelid-solutions-cpu-cooler-cctranq01a) or buying a cheap 120mm cooler like the 212 evo and replacing the fan on it with a dead silent one (but this is a pricier option)\n\nWater cooling you say? Very expensive but it is absolutely amazing for cooling. I would only recommend it if you have already splashed out on at least an i7-3820 and dual 7970s, and plan to push them as far as they will go. The **XSPC kits** are a fantastic starting point, but if you are spending this much money you should really be planning out a loop and buying all the parts which suit your build best.\n\nOh you meant a CLC (closed loop cooler)? These are meh. You can get the same performance out of air cooling for less cost and it will be a lot quieter - the stock fans on current CLCs on the market tend to be high rpm to get good cooling temps. However there are advantages: because all the heat dissipation goes on at the radiator, it leaves the space around the socket. This also brings the advantage that it makes the build look a lot cleaner. All in all though, I wouldn't recommend them. Avoid Corsair CLCs, as a lot of people have had issues with the software and pump grinding issues even with the new \"i\" generation.\n\nThermal paste - [fills the microscopic air gaps between the CPU and the heatsink base to improve heat dissipation](http://www.hardwarelogic.com/articles/guides/Thermal_Paste/Heastsink_diagram.jpg). All coolers will come with enough for a few applications, and some come with the thermal paste screen printed to the bottom (the stock cooler and most CLCs). You want to apply a BB-sized ball in the centre of the CPU and use the heatsink to apply even pressure to spread it out. Simple as that. If you really mess up or want to reapply, remove the heatsink and you will need to clean the old paste off with Isopropyl Alcohol or [ArctiClean](http://www.amazon.com/ArctiClean-60ml-Kit-30ml/dp/B0007TOR08/) before applying new thermal paste and replacing the heatsink again.\n\n---\n\n**Thanks to the reddit text post character limit of 10,000, this will be continued into the comments**",

        "author": "markrobbo96",
        "body": "---\n\n**Motherboards**\n\n---\n\nThis is where some jargon needs to be explained. \n\nFirstly the most important thing is the [CPU socket](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/CPU_Socket_775_T.jpg/250px-CPU_Socket_775_T.jpg). Different CPUs will often use different sockets and thus will require a different motherboard to fit and support them. Current relevant socket include [LGA 1155](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_1155) (which fits sandybridge/ivybridge CPUs), [LGA 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_2011) (enthusiast sandybridge socket), [AM3+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM3%2B#Socket_AM3.2B) (for most modern AMD chips) and [FM2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_FM2) (for the latest generation APUs).\n\nThen you have to consider the chipset - the set of standardised chips on the motherboard. These usually match up nicely to the generation of processor. \n\nOn 1155, the relevant chipsets are:\n\n* B75 (business chipset which is good for non-overclockable ivybridge/sandybridge chips)\n\n* H77 (again good for the same use) - here I would recommend the [**Asrock H77M**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-h77m) or [**Asrock H77 Pro4-MVP**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-h77pro4mvp). The \"quality\" of the motherboard parts doesn't matter as much if you aren't planning to overclock, so get as many features as you can for the money.\n\n* Z77 (for overclockable ivybridge/sandybridge chips). This is the \"go-to\" chipset for /r/buildapc and for the i5-3570k. My recommendation is the [**Gigabyte GA-Z77-UD3H**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gaz77xud3h).\n\nA side note here: If you plan to use crossfire/SLI in the future then you will want to go Z77 - there are very few boards on the other chipsets which support the full 16 PCIe lanes the CPU is capable of. Don't get caught out by the manufacturer saying \"Crossfire is supported\" as this could mean one of the GPUs is limited to x4 speeds which has the potential to cripple it. A good indication of a motherboard not supporting x8/x8 crossfire/SLI is that crossfire is \"supported\" whereas SLI isn't listed. Either way you will be able to look into it and find out.\n\nOn 2011 the chipset is simple. You only have one choice - x79. The x79 boards are amazing - 32 PCIe lanes, quad channel RAM etc are all supported. My recommendation here is the [**Gigabyte X79-UD3**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gax79ud3) or [**Gigabyte X79-UP4**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gax79up4)\n\nI know very little about the AMD chipsets or board recommendations, so if someone could help me out here that would be fantastic. There are a really varied selection of chipsets as AMD keep their sockets on average longer than Intel.\n\nIn terms of form factor, ATX is the standard full sized board you will have seen on many builds in the subreddit. \n\nMicroATX is slightly smaller than this and you can buy smaller cases for, however the standard was built to be backwards compatible with ATX cases so if you want to shave off some money then you can always go for a cheaper microATX board.\n\nminiITX is smaller still! However instead of saving money this is where you start to pay a premium for fitting all those parts on a very small board. You can get really tiny cases for miniITX motherboards, but check CPU cooler height and length of your GPU to make sure it will all fit!\n\n---\n\n**RAM**\n\n---\n\nHere's an interesting one. There are a couple of things you have to consider, but the good thing about RAM is that there aren't really any \"terrible\" manufacturers to avoid like most other parts. So long as it meets certain criteria you are good.\n\nFirst thing is the fact that you want [DDR3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM) RAM. THis is the latest generation standard for RAM and is faster, has more bandwidth and is lower power than [DDR2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR2_SDRAM) (it's predecessor).\n\nThen you need to look at the speed. The thing with RAM for gaming PCs is that you only need so much speed. [The difference in speed past DDR3-1333 matters only a very small amount](http://www.anandtech.com/show/4503/sandy-bridge-memory-scaling-choosing-the-best-ddr3) so there is no point in paying a premium for faster speed RAM. That being said the standard buy for most people is DDR3-1600 as it is priced nicely in the market at not much more than DDR3-1333.\n\nThe exception to this is APUs: as the RAM is used as VRAM for the integrated graphics the more speed the better!\n\n[CAS latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas_latency) can also be a factor. This is essentially the delay between a request to access a position in memory being sent and the data being fetched from RAM to the output pins. The standard for this is CAS 9, where less is better.\n\nVoltage is argued a lot. Strictly speaking anything over 1.5V could damage the memory controller on your ivybridge CPU, but 1.65V is unlikely to cause damage even over long periods of time. To play it safe, stick with 1.5V RAM.\n\nFinally you want at least 2 sticks of RAM so you can take advantage of [dual-channel](http://www.crucial.com/kb/answer.aspx?qid=3751) reducing delays and increasing bandwidth. With an x79 chipset you want 4 sticks of RAM for quad channel, which works in a similar way.\n\nI only have one kit of RAM to actually recommend specifically over others. However it only applies if you are going to be overclocking it. That would be the [**Samsung Green 2x4gb \"Wonder\" RAM**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/samsung-memory-mv3v4g3dus) dubbed this as it is absolutely fantastic for overclocking. At 1.5V, you can easily get the CAS latency down to the standard 9 as well as increasing the clock speed and still have it be stable.\n\nIf you don't plan to overclock, just buy RAM which meets the criteria above and you are all set.\n\n---\n\n**Storage**\n\n---\n\nThe capacity is up to you. How big is your steam library? How much porn do you have to store? 1TB is the sweet spot for most people.\n\nRPM gives you a basic indicator of speed, but it isn’t reliable as a measure - not all 7200rpm drives are created equal. Quality and reliability are argued again, but it is not easy to measure.\n\nYou can’t beat a [**Seagate Barracuda**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/seagate-internal-hard-drive-st1000dm003) for value if you are looking at buying a standard desktop drive.\n\nIf you plan to make a large storage array then I would recommend the [**WD Caviar Red**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd10efrx) drives specifically designed for this purpose. Another good option is an enterprise level storage drive. This is where we are talking real top of the line reliability and performance as well as good performance as part of a RAID array or even on their own. The king here is the [**WD RE4**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd1003fbyx) at a good price point. It periodically goes on sale too, sometimes to only ~$20-30 less than it’s barracuda alternative, which makes it an obvious choice.\n\nSSDs? YES. If you have the luxury of the extra cash to spend on a 128gb boot drive SSD then do it. It will massively increase the responsiveness and speed of the system and is the best thing you can add to a system made for general web browsing and word processing. I/O is the biggest bottleneck in most systems. My recommendations here go to the [**Kingston HyperX 3K**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/kingston-internal-hard-drive-sh103s3120g), [**Sandisk Extreme**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/sandisk-internal-hard-drive-sdssdx120gg25) and if you want to splash out, the [**Samsung 840 Pro**](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz7pd128bw) is my top of the line favourite.",

    "body": "So I work at a brewery taproom that also serves pizza, and I'm one of the shift leads (basically manager when the managers aren't around). We have a men's restroom, a women's restroom, and a family restroom that has a changing station. ( this is important later) About 30 minutes before we closed I noticed a coworker talking to a lady at one of our couches in our little lounge area that has several couches and a very small, low table. We also have a bunch of high top tables and booths around the taproom. It looked like the lady was changing an infants diaper ON THE COUCH. I have seen this happen here before, but not in about a year. Turns out she was indeed changing the baby's diaper on the couch, and my server was telling her she couldn't do that. The lady had basically finished already so there wasn't anything we could do. Once she had finished we cleaned the couch with disinfectant and isopropyl alcohol. Moments later, what we are assuming is the woman's husband, comes BEHIND THE BAR, with said infant in his arms, to interrogate my coworker about why she was being so rude and unprofessional and what the issue was. The situation quickly devolved into him telling us we did not take the situation into consideration, that the family bathroom was occupied, and that we wouldn't understand because we don't have kids ourselves (and yes he asked). He disregarded anything we said, basically ignoring us, while continuing to just talk at us about how awful we were. He just kept going on about it and wouldnt stop. My coworker was in the process of taking off her gloves that she was wearing while cleaning the couch, and turned to throw them in the trash that was behind the bar. This man did not like that and said \"don't turn away from me, come back here.\" At this point my coworker removed herself from the situation, told him she had enough and if he didn't like it then he could leave, and walked off. This was when I stepped in and told him, again, that he needed to leave. Multiple times I told him during all of this that under no circumstances was it acceptable to change a diaper in the taproom, seeing as how it's not only disgusting, but also a health code violation. No matter what I said he continued to ignore me and keep talking about how he did nothing wrong, and \"was respectful and never raised his voice.\" (His words.) Nothing that we said mattered to him, and all he wanted was to assert himself as being right and us as the bad guys. The first (first!) time I told him to leave he got all upset and was aghast that I told him to go. He responded with \"oh you're kicking me out? So I'm not paying for anything then?\" I told him three more times to leave after that. I was on the edge of telling him I would be calling the police for trespassing if he did not leave. At this point he asked me if I was a manager, and I was in the process of reaching for my mobile POS handheld to comp his bill just to get him to go away. When I turned to the side to reach for it he said \"oh now you're also turning away from me while im talking? Get back here.\" I told him his check was comped and his group needed to leave. He finally stopped complaining about how unprofessional we were, walked away, and gave a very chipper \"thanks for the hospitality!\" On his way out he even handed another server a $20 for her good service. Jokes on you, we tip share! All of this because he didn't like that we told his wife she couldn't change a diaper in the taproom. The sheer audacity and frail ego this man had was simply mind blowing. This capped off a night of shitty parents letting their children run around screaming, jump on the booths, and even one family who asked if their children could come behind the kitchen line. Please just go away and stop bringing children to breweries.",

I initially assumed this was picked to suit our smaller class size and affordability.  \n\nLater, the organizer mentioned it was mainly because they allow children.  I've never heard of a class reunion designed for bringing kids.  I eventually (carefully) inquired about why we would do that - and she said \"Because I don't have good childcare\".  She's married, for the record.   I wasn't surprised when we sold less than 10 tickets and the event was canceled.",

I bought this PC off a friend who swore it would “blow my measly game from 2006 outta the water.” It did not.\n\nHere’s what I’m working with:\n\n• CPU: Intel Core i7-7700\n\n• Motherboard: MSI Z270 Gaming M5 (MS-7A78)\n\n• GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060\n\n• RAM: 32GB\n\nSounds halfway decent, right? Well, jokes on me because this thing runs like absolute dogshit. Lag spikes, stuttering, and FPS randomly tanking into single digits. I can’t even open a web browser on one monitor and the game on the other. \n\nI ran UserBenchmark and it compared my gaming performance to a Tree Trunk. My CPU is literally at the 0th percentile. Zero. Worse than every other i7-7700 that’s ever existed. GPU and SSD also “performing below expectations.” What gives?\n\nNo other games installed. Nothing shady running in the background. Fresh install of Windows a couple months back. This thing should be overkill for a game that was designed for Windows XP. Do I begin upgrading or what?\n\nUPDATE: It’s running 100°C. We’ve determined the AIO could be faulty and I need thermal paste. I’m currently headed to the store to grab some thermal paste and isopropyl alcohol. \n\n[here’s the inside. the former owner is a heavy smoker and lived in a camper. This is the first time I’ve taken a look at the insides, and I’ve had it about a month.](https://imgur.com/a/uK0WZKD)\n\nUPDATE 2: I’m headed home with thermal paste in hand. I have reached out to my “friend” and asked him if he had any thermal paste, and asked him if he tested the AIO before selling to me. His response was (and I quote), “have u cleaned it stuff gets dusty fast”. \n\nUPDATE 3: Currently digging in, [there was no thermal paste.](https://imgur.com/a/7HXd8kr)\n\nFINAL UPDATE: New paste installed. Radiator and fans installed CORRECTLY. Running at 50°C. AIO seems to be working great now that it’s facing the correct direction and has thermal paste. No lag on Maplestory. [Fixed temps.](https://imgur.com/a/fBb2XwI)\n\n[gameplay recording before the lag was fixed](https://imgur.com/a/C1WcwDa). This is a recording, not a screenshot. I wish that I was joking. \n\n[gameplay recording after the lag was fixed](https://imgur.com/a/PRVxIe3)",

This is downtown Kingston, midway along a corridor between Toronto and Montréal, not a remote community accessible by aircraft only.\n\nSix bars of Irish Spring was \"on sale\" for $6.99.  Regular price?  Seventeen dollars.\n\nSeventeen dollars for 6 small bars of crappy soap.\n\nThe rubbing alcohol was priced at almost six dollars for a small bottle.\n\nI walked out, held my nose, and went to Walmart.  $8 for 12 bars of a much better soap and $3.49 for the same sized bottle of rubbing alcohol.\n\nSo here I am, exporting Canadian dollars to the US through Walmart, something I've tried so hard not to do.\n\nWell done, Galen.",

Everything is uhh, still manual, I mean, our longevity is all just medical and hygiene advances… Okay see in the past the vast majority of humans died a lot earlier, I mean it wasn't until the Industrial Revolution that humans began to live longer more full lives. With medical advances such as penicillin and antibiotics we could stave off more Illnesses that killed people younger, oh almost forgot immunization, *that* alone saved billions of lives across the century.\n\n**Dr Xant**: Immunization? \n\n**Subject**: You're, you're kidding me right?\n\n**Dr Xant**: Jasmine I think that through all our time together you would have come to the conclusion our senses of humour are very different.\n\n**Subject**: … Okay, well, immunization is when a weaker strain of a virus is introduced into the body for our white blood cells to attack and create antibodies for, so when a real virus shows up our bodies are already prepared for it.\n\n**Dr Xant**: You.. Knowingly introduce a deadly virus into your immune system, it adapts and is able to eliminate the threat?\n\n**Subject**: You’re telling me that’s not how everyone else does it?\n\n**Dr Xant**: We’ve been adding counteractive measures to our gene pools since the war, but they are scripted to defend against specific strains of virus and bacteria.\n\n**Subject**: I… You've lost me Xant, are you saying you create viruses to defeat other viruses?\n\n**Dr Xant**: Yes, in simple terms but we do engineer viruses to attack other offending viruses.\n\n**Subject**: I’m amazed you’re not all dead from some mutated strain… \n\n**Dr Xant**: Genetic diversity is ensured and perfected during the engineering process, if a species gene pool is too homogenic then they’re susceptible to all kinds of Viral or Bacterial threats… Jasmine, you’ve gone pale.\n\n**Subject**: Xant, You’re talking about biological warfare…(*<Unease>*)  Humanity classifies that as like, the greatest war crime ever, we’ve got stockpiles of bombs that could irradiate the entire planet and destroy all life on earth, but biological warfare, that’s just...\n\n**Dr Xant**: I think, for the first time, I have upset you.\n\n**Subject**: I'm just thinking of the ramifications… We have diseases locked away that could devastate entire populations in hours, but you guys have been perfecting the one act of war we all agreed was just too horrible to commit… \t\n\n**Dr Xant**: If it puts you at ease, it is a dark chapter of the universe that has come to a close. You can refer to the ‘Painful Dynasty’ in the history Logs, but we have strayed from the topic; humanity has not yet implemented genetic engineering into their development cycle and yet you have extended your lives beyond what we in the galactic council thought the limit of conscious life.\n\n**Subject**: The limit? That’s not the limit at all-\n\n**Dr Xant**: It is the limit we allowed ourselves. Extending it beyond those limitations causes, cultural problems I am not qualified to answer without bias. \n\n**Subject**: Im not sure what you’re asking Xant, are you asking how we did it?\n\n**Dr Xant**: … I am sorry Jasmine, this is a very controversial topic among the galactic council, and I am bound to uphold the views of the company that support it. But if you have not extended your life through overt genetic engineering then it means... (...) I am not qualified to talk about this. I am sorry I tried to probe further.\n\n[*Note: due to the impromptu nature of the interview I did not have the necessary notes available to me at the time of questioning, I will refrain from doing such interviews with the subject in the future. Cultural guidance will be supplied by Dr Kyda Jess in subsequent sessions*]\n\n**Subject**: (*<Worried>*) … It's alright, I'll read the history logs.\n\n[*Long pause*]\n\n**Subject**:  We can talk about something else? I'm sure there’s more fascinating things about the human body I can wow you with… Did you know we can drink disinfectant fluid and get a high from it?\n\n**Dr Xant**: I beg your pardon?\n\n[*Note: Subject rose from the desk and walked over to Krydon’s medicinal cabinet, pulling out a small vial of a mild disinfectant, sniffing it and returning to her place*]\n\n**Subject**: Isopropyl alcohol, rubbing alcohol, I mean it’s not the stuff we drink for recreational purposes, but in very small amounts, it produces the same effects. I smelt the stuff all over the living quarters, you don’t forget the smell of cleaning alcohol.\n\n**Dr Xant**: Please elaborate Jasmine...\n\n**Subject**: (<happy>) Alcohol, Ethanol technically, as long as it remains under 0.08% causes an intoxication effect, relaxing, warming the body and lowering inhibitions…  Huh, it might even help our next meditation session, Ethanol suppresses certain brain signals and enhances others, such as the filter between what I think and what I say.  \n\n**Dr Xant**: and when it rises above 0.08%?\n\n**Subject**: Yeah, that’s the downside, Ethanol is still fairly poisonous to the human body. Our liver can filter a couple of mililiters at a time, but the build up causes a lot of problems. It impairs speech, perception, motor skills, memory, we lose balance, and our pain receptors dull too, so we don't feel as much when we get hurt. Over long term exposure it degrades our internal organs, restricts circulation, destroys brain cells -\n\n[*Note: Subject later explained that during her research for her studies she was exposed to and expected to memorize several different types of ethanol and its chemical structures. She was expected to understand its hazardous effects before producing it as a consumable.*] \n\n**Dr Xant**: If it has such a detrimental effect on the body I can only assume it must also have narcotic properties, Glucose has a very similar effect in the Sulin.\n\n**Subject**: Huh, the Sulin (lizards) get addicted to sugar? I mean, humans can get addicted to sugar too, combine sugar and alcohol and you get a wicked high that disguises the horrible taste of the thing that gets you drunk. The repercussions of the mixture next morning however…. (*laughs*) Ha, I can imagine, sugar is cocaine to Sulin (*lizards*) and were the weirdos for drinking cleaning fluid.\n\n**Dr Xant**: Organic chemistry may have to be the next subject we discuss, if I recall correctly there were other chemical structures within your initial commutative illustrations that were also cause for concern.\n\n**Subject**: Which ones were they? Salt, caffeine, chilli powder or vegetable oil? Xant, the only reason I know those chemical structures is because a friend bought me a novelty chemistry kitchen set. \n\n[*Note: Almost all the more complex chemical structures the subject outlaid in the initial 7000 illustrations were consumables.*] \n\n**Dr Xant**:... Ah yes, that is what it was Caffeine. A great stimulant for the Zenthi and Qzetillia, lethal to the Arvas. As a result its tightly regulated within council space.\n\n**Subject**: Oh man, earth practically runs on caffeine, I’m not sure we could survive the modern world without it. We have entire professions dedicated to the serving of caffeine, alcohol too for that matter, Baristas and Brewers, that's what I wanted to be, a Brewer.(*sigh*) \n\n[*Long pause*]\n\n**Subject**: I’m not surprised caffeine is lethal to the Arvas (*grasshoppers*) though, I know it can be used as a natural pesticide, my friend Daniel throws all his coffee grounds on his garden, and no bugs.\n\n[*Note: Subject seems to be referring to a classification of a species in this instance that may or may not resemble the Arvas in at least appearance but certainly not behavior. Subject also seems to be more comfortable revealing more personal experiences*]\n\n**Dr Xant**: Jasmine, it appears that with every conversation we have it only seems to draw more questions than answers-\n\n**Unknown 1**: [*Muffled*] Restrain the specimen immediately!\n\n**Unknown 2**: *Whimper! Yelp!*\n\n**Subject**: (*<Surprise, Curiosity, Panic>*)\n\n[*Note: There was a loud commotion on the other side of CMO Krydons office, created by Dr Duuarns Specimen. Subject stood up on an instinctual response to the noise.*]\n\n**Dr Xant**: Jasmine! Get away from the door! \n\n**Unknown 2**: *Whimper! whine!!*\n\n**Unknown 1**: Get it under control now!!\n\n[*Session ended*]\n\n---\n\nXant shut off the recording as Jasmine practically leapt from her stool to the office door.\n\n“Jasmine!?” Xant called out confused as he watched the normally level headed human swipe her hand furiously at the doors sensor. The doors polite chime was ignored, as soon as the white plastic slid open Jasmine jumped through.\n\nHer body tensed and Xant felt a shock through his own system, disgust, anger, fear. He craned  his head to see, needing to know what could have caused such a horrid shock.\n\n“Oh my god puppy..” Jasmine’s voice whimpered. A sulin handler held one of Duuarn’s specimens by the throat, its golden fur scruffed and appendages flailing wildly, tail tucked between its legs. Even without a translator you could see the creature was terrified. Jasmines entire body clenched, her face red with fury as she yelled.\n \n“LET GO OF HER THROAT!!” \nEveryone in the room froze. The Sulin handler releasing the specimen from his clawed hand, letting the poor thing drop to the floor. The staff watched on as the golden furred creature scrambled to its feet and ran past everyone, including Jasmine, and into Kyrdon’s office, yelping in fear at the sight of Xant before cowering beside the only free standing shelf. Jasmine was not finished however unleashing a torrent of emotion and intimidation against the confused handler.\n“What the *hell* were you doing?!” she demanded, fists clenched and water forming in her eyes as she glared him down. “You could have choked her! Or severed her spine! You *NEVER* hold and animal like that!!” \n\nThe sulin handler, raised his claws in surrender.\n\n“I… I'm sorry?” he choked through sharp teeth. Jasmine gasped, and took a step back, realising what she was doing.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she muttered quickly, averting her eyes, “Just, don't do it again.” She snapped and spun on her heel storming toward the office.\nXant had barely moved, he had not seen Duuarn’s specimen since they had opened the stasis pods weeks earlier. Now it was awake and moving in the office, trembling as Jasmine had done when he had first encountered her. Jasmine had taken control now, like an Arvas prince she commanded without words, no one was to go near her or the specimen, no one was to move. Everyone watched on with curiosity and trepidation, observing as she stood her ground against the staff and then as it melted away when facing the creature. Lowering down to her knees, voice becoming soft. A single hand outstretched and beckoning.\n “It's okay puppy…” she spoke just above a whisper “You're safe now, it's okay. I won't let them hurt you any more... It's okay…” \nThe creatures eyes darted from Jasmine to Xant behind her, its head and ears lowered.\n\n\"(*Xant…Leave the room slowly, don't make any sudden movements.*)\" Jasmine's voice was firm, an order she expected him to obey. The doctor slid his feet, inching out of the room while keeping an eye on Jasmine. \nHer focus was completely on the ‘puppy’ whispering comforting words, her hands reaching out to it. It was only after Xants exit did the creature move, approaching Jasmine for a sniff, before nudging her hand. Gentle pats upon the head became a full embrace, Jasmine rubbed it fur and pressed her cheek to its own. The ‘puppy’ in turn gave a lick to Jasmine's face before resting its head upon her shoulder.\n\n\"(*Xant have everyone stand up against the walls, I’m coming out…*)\" Another order came through the translator, but he didn’t need to deliver it. The staff backed off in unison as Jasmine emerged from the office, the large creature cradled in her arms. \n\n“It’s okay puppy, we're just going to go for a walk (*I’m returning to my room…*) we're going to go to my room for a play (*I’ll let you know when we’ve calmed down…*)and maybe a nap, definitely some food…” The staff were staring in amazement as she delivered two different but comprehensible messages at once. She walked past them all without even so much as a glance, her arms straining under the weight but showed no signs of faltering.\n\nXant understood now. \nHow she was so adept at reading body language, the creature could not comprehend her words without a translator, but understood her intentions completely.\n An unspoken language.\n \nThere was a minutes silence after Jasmine and the creature had left the lab, everyone staring at each other, wondering, waiting for direction.\n\nDr Krydon cleared his throat.\n“I think that will be all for today…” He announced “Pa, Nu, gather what data you have on the other specimens and send them to my terminal, Ceaan, you’d best have an explanation ready as to why Duuarns prized specimen is now in the captive hands of… Jasmine” He turned his head to look at the other Sulin handler through his cybernetic eye. “Nyk, I suggest we have you transferred to another team...” The young handler did not protest, lowering his head dejected.\n\n“Xant…” Krydon finally addressed the other department head beside him “You’d best go and sort this out with the Director before Duaarn gets informed, the last thing we need is that bloated head screeching at us..” \n\n“Agreed.” Xant replied absentmindedly, still staring at the door where Jasmine had left.\n\n---\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5tcesp/oc_research_transcripts_of_dr_xant_translator/) =[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5xyqwf/oc_transcriptspt_6_personal_log_of_urunav_xant/) = [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SquiggleStoryStudios) = [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/transcripts) = [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5zccjr/oc_transcriptspt_8_transcripts_of_ed_salhor/)\n",

I got trapped in a contract that had me paying rent on the place regardless of if I stayed and I couldn't afford to move out.\n\nDrug dealer that lives next door: \"I have this stuff, it's supposed to be a synthetic opioid but I don't trust the guy that gave it to me.\"\n\nKevin: *Pulls a pipe made from a mtn dew can out if nowhere and attempting to smoke the white powder before the dealer even finishes*\n\n*chases it down with a swig of isopropyl alcohol*\n\nLater that night Kevin drank an entire bottle of spiced rum by himself, went to bed, got up and peed all over his bed like a huge urinal, and slept in it again.\n\nKevin traded a $400 speaker for 3 fake tabs of acid he only found out were fake when he was arrested for them but couldn't be convinced due to them not being potent enough to do anything.\n\nKevin somehow had a girlfriend back home. They agreed to have an open relationship while he was at school, but he dumped her when she mentioned having coffee with another guy. During that time Kevin somehow managed to seduce 2-3 different girls a week and still thought he was the victim of a cheater.\n\nKevin got the clap. 4 times. Twice from the same girl who wouldn't get it treated because she thought the nursing students ran the university health center.\n\nKevin faked a cough and somehow got prescribed opioid based cough syrup from the university health center. He drank the entire bottle in 15 seconds.\n\nKevin didn't believe isopropyl alcohol was actually toxic, and drank it by the pint.\n\nKevin found possibly the single biggest Kevina alive, she was both a pansexual LGBTQ rights activist and a card carrying member of the KKK.\n\nKevin got herpes from her.\n\nKevin got paranoid he was going to be arrested after hot boxing all of someone else's weed and pulled the fire alarm at 3 am.\n\nKevin got sued for child support.\n\nKevin tried to change his major to one that the school didn't offer.\n\nKevin got in trouble for taking pictures of Jahova's Witnesses and tried to argue freedom of the press. He wasn't even remotely affiliated with a news agency.\n\nKevin woke up at 4pm and thought it was 4am\n\nKevin went to any given class maybe once a week and didn't understand how he could be failing.\n\nKevin's GPA was 1.2, I'm still amazed it wasn't lower.\n\nThis was all during 1 year.\n\n*Edit:\nThis was the 2015-2016 school year, last I heard Kevin was sacrificing goats to Dionysus on his family vineyard and unironically believes the police go out of their way to harass white upper class protestants. He ended up majoring in photography. He also supported Bill Clinton for president in 2016, not Hillary, Bill.",

    "body": "A few of you asked how I made my custom V5 strawberry-themed shell, so I promised I’d share what I did and what I used.\n\nStep 1: Disassembly & Screen Restoration\nThe first thing I did was take the shell apart using a precision screwdriver. Then I spent a couple of days restoring the screen, removing deep scratches and polishing it up.\nFor that, I used:\n🍓 A nail buffing cube\n🍓 Polywatch polishing paste (in hindsight plastic would have been better but I could only get polish one at the time) \n🍓 Q-tips and a polishing cloth.\n\nStep 2: Surface Prep\nNext, I removed all existing artwork using 70% isopropyl alcohol, then lightly sanded the shell to help the paint adhere better. I sprayed all parts separately with a cream colored base and let them dry completely.\nBase paint used: \n🤍 Citadel Wraith Bone Base.\n\nStep 3: Painting\nI applied the main color with a small brush, doing about two coats and allowing it to dry between layers. Using a sponge, I blended in light and dark greens, then added a bit of pink to soften the transitions, going back and forth until I was happy with the blend.\nAfter everything dried, I applied a bit of shimmer glitter using a makeup applicator, then added the artwork and strawberry stickers.For the 3D strawberry on the chimney, I used Gorilla Glue.\n\nPaints used:\n🌱 Mont Marte Signature Acrylic Paint Set (I got the full pastel set as I love the colors!)\n🌱 Citadel Colour Layer Paints\n🌱 A tiny miniatures brush\nTip: You can practice painting and curing on spare bits of plastic first. To get a 3D effect, you can mix acrylic paint with either gesso or moulding paste, or use pre made 3D stickers whichever method suits you best.\n\nStep 4: Sealing with UV Resin\nOnce the paint dried, I used a very soft brush to apply UV resin. I cured each part for 2 or 3 minutes, doing about three thin coats and being extra careful around the edges.\nTo remove any sticky residue, I dipped the pieces in water and cured them again. Then I left them by the window for a day to ensure everything was fully cured.\n\nImportant:\n🍓Always research the type of resin you're using.\n🍓Wear gloves as resin can be toxic.\n🍓 Clean your brush thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol before washing.\n🍓 Cure any leftover resin in your silicone container before disposal.\n\nThat’s pretty much it! 😊I’ve attached a few pics, hope it helps and inspires your own customisations ✨\n",

There were a couple areas that were peeling up from my disassembly as the old black leather needs to be peeled away in order to access a few screws for removing the top plate. I debated for ages as to what color I wanted to make it and I've always loved this teal aqua blue color on chrome bodies. It might not be for everyone, but it's certainly for me. \n\nIt took me about 8 hours of continuous work to remove the old adhesive: softening it with isopropyl alcohol and pulling it up millimeter by millimeter with a plastic scraper until the bare metal was perfectly clean before I could apply the new leather. \n\nMy original post about the restoration: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/1e6fv7j/i\\_found\\_my\\_favorite\\_nikon\\_the\\_minimalist\\_nikon\\_s2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/1e6fv7j/i_found_my_favorite_nikon_the_minimalist_nikon_s2/)",

I was hoping that sunlight and fresh air would help, but my lid is not made of vampires.\n\nAccepting temporary defeat I moved the fight back onto home turf, and got a new set of supplies. Shout out to u/generic-curiosity who reminded me about the hydrophobic properties of my cinnenemy. With this knowledge, I was ready to reengage in this battle\n\nI armed myself with a bottle of isopropyl alcohol, a Love is Blind sized wad of paper towels, and…olive oil.\n\nI scrubbed with alcohol, then rubbed it down with the oil, then back at it again with the alcohol.  Out of context, that would make for an amazing party game.\n\nthis Sisyphean deodorizing battle will haunt my dreams for years to come.\n\nI don’t remember how many times I repeated this alcohol and oil endeavor, but I’m going to choose the number 6, because of the evil connotations of the number.\n\nMuch like my spirit, the smell has died down and has become a repressed whisper of the wild soul it once was.\n\nSatisfied that my slow cooker no longer bore the tonsil-coating scent of a season craft store mid-december, I went on my merry way. Ignorant, I Know.\n\nAs the days went on, and I continued to use more kitchen supplies, I began to think this was all in my mind – I just. Kept. Smelling. It. SOMEWHERE.\n\nLike any sane person I started sniffing around my kitchen like a tweaked out 2 legged bloodhound.  I had used a rubber spatula to stir my cinnncoction. Immediately binned it. I refuse to bend my will for the $2 spatula. And now, it will never see the light of day again, forever to think about how it failed to serve its culinary master. Forever to miss the hot broth it once knew. It must suffer in perpetuity for its betrayal.\n\nAnd I am NEVER using cinnamon again.\n\nthe apple butter tastes amazing.",

    "body": "When we at Galacticracked published last month's article \"Ten Reasons to be Afraid of our Newest Allies\", we were a little nervous about what would happen if it ever fell into human hands.  We asked the state department, and they said not to worry: it probably wouldn't.  (New species are given copies of the greatest artistic works of the galaxy to aid cultural integration, but apparently Galacticracked doesn't make the list.)  And even if it did, they said, Humans have a sense of humor and are entirely capable of taking a joke.\n\nNot long after we published, we began getting letters from Humans.  Not a single threat, so it seems the part about being able to take a joke is true (phew), just polite little corrections.  This does suggest they're probably quite capable of *telling* jokes, so we can't vouch for the accuracy of any of these letters.  We still thought you should see them:\n\n**Little Risk of That**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nI enjoyed your recent description of my home (Earth) as a “deathworld” and of my continent in particular (Australia) as the deadliest, but I regret to inform you that your description of Australia contained some urban legends.  Drop bears and Yowie do not actually exist; crocodiles will not hunt a specific individual for hundreds of miles, and Funnel-web spiders, while deadly, cannot dissolve your entire body in seconds.\n\nAustralia has a long and proud tradition of exaggerating its dangers to outsiders.  Why, you ask?  Well, it's simple.  By human standards, living on a continent of 90% inhospitable desert with dozens of extremely venomous animals and a handful that can simply rip you limb from limb *just isn't dangerous enough*.  If we didn't exaggerate, people would think we'd gone soft!\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Name Withheld]\n\n**If Anything, We're More Confused**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nIn your recent article on humanity, I think you got confused because of the phrase “martial art”.  Let me see if I can help.\n\nJiu Jitsu is a style of violence.  It is often practiced in a spirit of friendly competition, with rules to prevent (or at least decrease the frequency of) serious injury, but it is at its core about subduing an opponent.\n\nBallet is a style of dance.  It is about beauty and is fundamentally collaboration.\n\nTrue, both involve picking other people up and throwing them in the air, and many of the early exercises (for balance and body-awareness) are the same, but they really are entirely different activities.\n\nI hope this clears things up.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Name Withheld]\n\n**A Handful a Year is Too Many for Us**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nI am writing to clarify a few points with regard to human pet-keeping. You wrote that “Millions of humans keep apex predators in their homes for the sake of 'cuddliness',” and that “Dogs are a subspecies of wolves: smaller but still as deadly.”\n\nFirst of all, while most dogs are smaller than wolves, some are considerably larger.\n\nBut the important difference is that dogs are *friendlier* than wolves.  Many dogs are physically capable of ripping out their owners' throats, but only a handful each year actually do.  This is why, though they are biologically a subspecies, it makes more sense to think of them as a different sort of animal.  A thousand generations of selective breeding can make a real difference.\n\n[Editor's note: Combining this last sentence with Human history suggests that all living dogs are descended from pet wolves kept before the development of metallurgy or agriculture.  Perhaps Humans have mellowed?]\n\nSome Humans do keep wolves as pets, but this is something that thousands, not millions, of humans do.  The practice is somewhat controversial.  It can go well, but failing to properly socialize the cub can result in a feral creature which is a danger to all around it, and keeping a wolf in an inadequate space is cruel to the animal.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Name Withheld]\n\n**In which We Learn Not to Ask Rhetorical Questions**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nIn your recent article on humanity you discussed the habit of smoking and asked “What's next? Recreational setting oneself on fire?”  As a regular practitioner of recreational self-fire-setting, I can assure you that it is *safer* than smoking.  Granted, it can go horribly wrong, but if done properly serious injuries are extremely unlikely and there is no long-term health risk at all.\n\nTo speak more precisely, human skin isn't very flammable so we cover ourselves (or each other) in highly flammable liquids and ignite those.  My favorite fuel is isopropyl alcohol, usually diluted with water to 75% concentration.  [Editor's note: As a follow-up, we asked what the alcohol was reacting with.  Yes, it's Earth's **20% oxygen** atmosphere.  Yikes!]\n\nPlease don't go out and try it based on my description alone.  It can go wrong, and you really should study in-person with an expert before trying it yourself.\n\nYou may ask what comes next after fire?  There's no single answer, but one option is to combine fire with other things.  For example, you can ignite your friends using 50 kilovolt electric shocks.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Name Withheld]\n\n**Sounds Like If We Hadn't Skimped on Research, We'd Never have Made Deadline**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nYou recently described human religion as “Believing in three gods, who are also one god, in a way that we don't understand and we don't think the humans do either, but that hasn't stopped them from fighting bloody wars about it.”  That's a recognizable though not entirely accurate description of Christianity, which is our largest religion, but is still practiced by less than a quarter of our population.\n\nOn Earth you will find religions that worship one god, or several, or countless, or countless which are all in some way aspects of one, or something so far beyond mortal comprehension that it cannot be described as “one” but only as “not many”.  As the old human saying goes, fear not: you may yet be confused.\n\nYou may wonder, if subtle disagreements over Christian doctrine have produced giant bloody wars, what must these larger differences produce?  Or is it the other way around, that deeply unlike religions can ignore each other more easily and therefore have smaller conflicts?  A real answer would be a life's work for a historian, but as near as I can tell, it's been about a tie.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Name Withheld]\n\n**Not Sure this Counts as a Correction**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nIn your recent article on humanity you described us as Earth's “biggest and deadliest predator”.  We are certainly not the biggest.  Of terrestrial creatures, both [bears](http://boredomfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/animal-size-comparison-4.jpg) and [tigers](http://boredomfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/animal-size-comparison-1.jpg) routinely outweigh us by a factor of four.  The overall largest predator on Earth is the strictly aquatic [sperm whale](http://boredomfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/animal-size-comparison-10.jpg) which outweighs us by a factor of 160.  Not only is their length 8 times our height, their *width* is roughly twice our *height*.\n\nAs for deadliest, we did hunt all these creatures nearly to extinction a few centuries ago [Editor's note: *before* humanity industrialized!] but we've gotten much more careful about hunting and hardly ever do things like that anymore.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Name Withheld]",

It is about beauty and is fundamentally collaboration.\n\nTrue, both involve picking other people up and throwing them in the air, and many of the early exercises (for balance and body-awareness) are the same, but they really are entirely different activities.\n\nI hope this clears things up.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Name Withheld\\]\n\n**A Handful a Year is Too Many for Us**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nI am writing to clarify a few points with regard to human pet-keeping. You wrote that “Millions of humans keep apex predators in their homes for the sake of 'cuddliness',” and that “Dogs are a subspecies of wolves: smaller but still as deadly.”\n\nFirst of all, while most dogs are smaller than wolves, some are considerably larger.\n\nBut the important difference is that dogs are friendlier than wolves. Many dogs are physically capable of ripping out their owners' throats, but only a handful each year actually do. This is why, though they are biologically a subspecies, it makes more sense to think of them as a different sort of animal. A thousand generations of selective breeding can make a real difference.\n\n\\[Editor's note: Combining this last sentence with Human history suggests that all living dogs are descended from pet wolves kept before the development of metallurgy or agriculture. Perhaps Humans have mellowed?\\]\n\nSome Humans do keep wolves as pets, but this is something that thousands, not millions, of humans do. The practice is somewhat controversial. It can go well, but failing to properly socialize the cub can result in a feral creature which is a danger to all around it, and keeping a wolf in an inadequate space is cruel to the animal.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Name Withheld\\]\n\n**In which We Learn Not to Ask Rhetorical Questions**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nIn your recent article on humanity you discussed the habit of smoking and asked “What's next? Recreational setting oneself on fire?” As a regular practitioner of recreational self-fire-setting, I can assure you that it is safer than smoking. Granted, it can go horribly wrong, but if done properly serious injuries are extremely unlikely and there is no long-term health risk at all.\n\nTo speak more precisely, human skin isn't very flammable so we cover ourselves (or each other) in highly flammable liquids and ignite those. My favorite fuel is isopropyl alcohol, usually diluted with water to 75% concentration. \\[Editor's note: As a follow-up, we asked what the alcohol was reacting with. Yes, it's Earth's 20% oxygen atmosphere. Yikes!\\]\n\nPlease don't go out and try it based on my description alone. It can go wrong, and you really should study in-person with an expert before trying it yourself.\n\nYou may ask what comes next after fire? There's no single answer, but one option is to combine fire with other things. For example, you can ignite your friends using 50 kilovolt electric shocks.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Name Withheld\\]\n\n**Sounds Like If We Hadn't Skimped on Research, We'd Never have Made Deadline**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nYou recently described human religion as “Believing in three gods, who are also one god, in a way that we don't understand and we don't think the humans do either, but that hasn't stopped them from fighting bloody wars about it.” That's a recognizable though not entirely accurate description of Christianity, which is our largest religion, but is still practiced by less than a quarter of our population.\n\nOn Earth you will find religions that worship one god, or several, or countless, or countless which are all in some way aspects of one, or something so far beyond mortal comprehension that it cannot be described as “one” but only as “not many”. As the old human saying goes, fear not: you may yet be confused.\n\nYou may wonder, if subtle disagreements over Christian doctrine have produced giant bloody wars, what must these larger differences produce? Or is it the other way around, that deeply unlike religions can ignore each other more easily and therefore have smaller conflicts? A real answer would be a life's work for a historian, but as near as I can tell, it's been about a tie.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Name Withheld\\]\n\n**Not Sure this Counts as a Correction**\n\nDear Galacticracked Magazine,\n\nIn your recent article on humanity you described us as Earth's “biggest and deadliest predator”. We are certainly not the biggest. Of terrestrial creatures, both bears and tigers routinely outweigh us by a factor of four. The overall largest predator on Earth is the strictly aquatic sperm whale which outweighs us by a factor of 160. Not only is their length 8 times our height, their width is roughly twice our height.\n\nAs for deadliest, we did hunt all these creatures nearly to extinction a few centuries ago \\[Editor's note: before humanity industrialized!\\] but we've gotten much more careful about hunting and hardly ever do things like that anymore.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Name Withheld\\]",

    "body": "Okay, so I want to share a quite unbelievable story with everyone. I'm working in a recycling center as the only one who actually repairs devices (on logic board level). After plenty of time I spent in our huge warehouse, I found a ThinkPad T400 on one of the shelves. Since I really like ThinkPads there was no time to waste, I picked it up. It was simply disgusting. I noticed very serious water damage on it, and it had an exteremely strong chlorine smell. Also, there were small bugs living inside it. Of course I left it there, but after some days it started to bother me. Just as a challenge... Would I be able to save it? My boss just laughed when I told him I wanted to buy this. But after I assured him that I'm dead serious, we negotiated \\~2USD as a price.\n\n\n\nAfter I got home with it (in an airtight bag, to avoid any infections :D ), I hurried to take it apart. What I found inside was even more disgusting. There was literally mold growing in some places, and there was serious corrosion everywhere on the magnesium housing. There was no turning back. I washed most of the parts in hot tapwater (except the screen assembly and motherboard), since at this point, the state of this machine could not get worse from pretty much anything I do. After that I cleaned everything with detergent. The third and final was isopropyl alcohol to remove most of the corrosion. After the machine still was not great, but at least acceptable physically, there came the hardest part. Testing the motherboard separately and reviving it. After tons of measuring and a bit of soldering it started to show signs of life. But still did not post. The BIOS data was corrupted, so I had to desolder the 16pin EEPROM and rewrite it. Now the board was seemingly back in business. I was sure the LCD would be completely dead after these conditions, but after some cleaning I decided to try it. To my suprise it did work too. Yeah, there are some marks and spots on it from liquid damage, but nothing what would disturb me. After a fast reassembly process, the machine worked nicely.\n\n[Water damage and mold everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/zn93uaz2m7131.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ae798f721f0fefdd331ce8dc91acf17c71e890a)\n\n\n\nTo be fair the following were replaced: battery (since the original one was simply so rotten I just left it in my workplace), keyboard (the original one is saveable I think, but it was disgusting and I did not want to waste my time with it)\n\n...and the followings were installed, since the machine came without them: Kingstone 120GB SSD, 8GB DDR3 RAM, Intel Core 2 Duo P9600 CPU\n\nThis whole process was completely irrational, since I spent nearly 50 hours working on this T400. But it was kind of fascinating, I was happy to \"get him back on route\". I started to like him so much, that now he is my daily driver. I take him with me to work, university. He is reliable and robust, just like any other ThinkPad I see every day...but none of them has a story like this...the signs of water and chlorine will never disappear from his housing, but it's just a conversation starter, not a problem for me.\n\n\n\nI'm simply proud that I'm the owner of this T400, and I was able to do what I did.\n\n[Before...](https://preview.redd.it/9kgq8zq22k131.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2c2c2a23278c98d4e6d68f59825c07c3b1bcb36)\n\n[After...](https://preview.redd.it/zptbhd462k131.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3edc57948fe107d5e2b7befa656f4dfe7ea57935)\n\n[Before...](https://preview.redd.it/24hg5in82k131.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e81cbd32bb4b0eadaa8b1b5d48aea1177c8feace)\n\n[After...](https://preview.redd.it/qa8luqld2k131.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=580f7a15050839df6dd50e785ae55485a8c59460)\n\n[Before...](https://preview.redd.it/u1z1g4ml2k131.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=202e83b09e22ac53028729b0d641074f96890d95)\n\n\n\n[After...](https://preview.redd.it/3wj01qyo2k131.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35dbe693ce2f47d427246cd0ce71249c65201d9d)",

Obviously better to be cautious but personally, I have old iPads laying around as well which I never use and therefore suspect someone just tossed it out for someone else to make use of instead of sending it to recycling or going through the effort to selling it on Marketplace or such. Taking a quick look on German eBay, these things seem to go for around 80€ here, which might be a point where some people just do not care anymore and make someone else happy instead but giving it away for free.\n\nThere also is some use for it still, games like Hay Day and Clash of Clans are still supported on legacy devices and I think YouTube also is for example, just not with the newest version. Most apps do seem to require iOS 16 or higher in their newest versions. But in 2-3 years, it will probably become a lot more unusable but still usable for basic browsing and reading books.",

Safest bet is to take it to an Apple store/Genius bar, and have them inspect it. Just be somewhat honest, and let them know you suspect the device might not be legit but cannot tell, and maybe they have the tools to confirm. Might cost time/money, but still cheaper than an actual iPad.\n\nYou can probably also go through the boot up process to get to the home page.

Welcome to Roach Wars!***\n\n*You are now a conscripted soldier in our army. You'll need to put your fears away, get trained, and fight this enemy like your life depends on it. You can do this.*\n\nGen PCDuranet, CPCO, Retired\n\n**German roaches** public enemy #1 when it comes to indoor pests (bedbugs would be #2 because they don't spread as easily). They are tropical-like insects that need heat, food, moisture, and harborage to survive. The female (dark brown and oval-shaped - males are light brown and slender) will carry a **single egg case** (NOT individual eggs) until it is ready to hatch, at which time she releases it allowing 48 +/- young (instars) to emerge. Interbreeding is the reason they populate so quickly (the name G*erman* comes from the Latin *germanus*, meaning *of the same parents*).\n\nThey don't make *nests*, but *congregate* in cabinets, refrigerator compressors, stove tops, dishwashers, electronics, wall sockets, behind paneling, and occasionally wall voids (if there are holes). They can also travel from room to room and apartment to apartment by way of connecting water lines by traveling *on* them; not *in* them.\n\nControl methods include liquid sprays, genetic growth regulators in some situations, gel baits, glue traps, and sealing holes around pipes. Also, using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help remove heavy infestations, and removing paper/box/plastic bag clutter will help.\n\n(Note: ***brown banded*** roaches can be treated like German roaches. However, they are able to survive in drier areas like inside dressers and night tables, and they are not as prolific as German.)\n\n**A Word to the Wise**\n\n**DO NOT pick up items from the trash and bring them into your home. This is a sure way to get roaches, as is buying used items. Even inspecting them is no guarantee as there can be hidden spaces where they can hide. Also, used refrigerators are notorious for transferring roaches, and at minimum, should be quarantined in a non-living space and well inspected.**\n\n**Hunter Vs. Victim**\n\nMany have come here in despair and were able overcome them with this information by adopting a ***hunter's*** mentality as opposed to a ***victim's*** mentality. This is key, and the numerous success stories on the sub confirm that. You *can* beat these tiny beasts with a little knowledge, the right weapons, and the will to do so. Otherwise, you'll be in fear of them wherever you go.\n\n**Shame**\n\nFor many, a feeling of shame when having roaches weighs heavily. However, roaches do not differentiate between people and places and will attempt to infest anyone’s living space if possible. They can be found anywhere that provides the elements they need to survive.\n\nUnderstandably, this shame causes people to be very secretive about their affliction. Who brags about roaches on social media? Who wears a T-shirt proclaiming, “I Have Roaches!”? Who casually mentions at a party, “Hey, speaking of German roaches…”? *No one*; that’s who…\n\nBUT… what if you did just that? What if you ‘came out of the cabinet’ (see what I did there?) and angrily told everyone in your life, “Hey, guess what? I HAVE ROACHES IN MY APARTMENT! CAN YOU @#%& BELIEVE IT?” Then tell them how you found this sub and what you are doing about it. This ***will*** set you free! \\* You might be surprised to find some friends going through the same thing, and if any others react badly toward it, are they worth having in your life?\n\n*\\*Disclaimer: Do this at your own risk as it may totally ruin your life (but hopefully not). At the very least you’ll be free of keeping the secret.*\n\n**Sleeping**\n\nI recommend using a mosquito net to help you feel safe when you sleep. They are inexpensive and the pop-up models are simple to set up. Make if fun, like when you were a kid.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mosquito+bed+net&crid=8JER3UEYIFHW&sprefix=mosquito+bed+net%2Caps%2C188&ref=nb\\_sb\\_noss\\_1](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mosquito+bed+net&crid=8JER3UEYIFHW&sprefix=mosquito+bed+net%2Caps%2C188&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)\n\n**Breeding Populations**\n\nSeeing multiple bugs of all sizes *daily* is the general rule of thumb that defines a *breeding population* in apartments, condos, or single homes.\n\n**Sporadic Sightings**\n\nIf you are in an apartment and are seeing the occasional bug, they are usually traveling from connected units. **This is very common** and does not mean you have a breeding population. The best defense is spraying Alpine WSG every two weeks and using glue traps. Do not use gel bait (it dries out too quickly) or IGRs.\n\nAlso, when only small ones are seen, they are still usually coming from adjoining units because they can squeeze through areas that larger ones can't. As long as you are not seeing adults; you're doing relatively well.\n\n**Products**\n\n*(All products listed pose minimal risk and can be used around children and pets if mixed and applied according to the label. Also, concerns regarding resistance and bait aversion are rarely warranted in residential situations. These generally apply to chronic commercial infestations.)*\n\n**Alpine WSG** is the best professional spray on the market for roaches and contains 'dinotefuran', which has been granted *\\`****Reduced Risk Status\\`*** by the EPA for use in both public health and food handling establishments. It is undetectable by insects, transfers from one insect to another, *does not hinder bait acceptance,* and can be purchased in single, 10g packets. In Canada or Australia, look for **Seclira WSG** as it's the same product. eBay AU sells 200g bottles that will make 10 gals. of 20g solution for $135 (presently), which is less than a single pro treatment.\n\n***Alpine WSG*** can be purchased without a license on [diypestcontrol.com](http://diypestcontrol.com/) or Amaon, but cannot be purchased by non-pros in AZ, CO, CT, MA, MD, ME, NV, RI, VT. If you live in one of these states, **consider hiring a pest company and insist they use Alpine WSG**. Otherwise, look to buy ***Advion WDG*** *(Indoxacarb) or* ***Phantom*** *(Chlorfenapyr)* insecticide as they too are non-repellents. If you cannot buy any of these where you are, it is still possible to achieve good control or elimination using other products that are available to you; it just may take longer.\n\n*If* chemical **resistance \\*** is suspected after many months of using Alpine WSG, it is recommended to use Phantom\\*\\* insecticide as an alternative.\n\n\\* [https://pestcontrol.basf.us/content/dam/cxm/agriculture/pest-control/us/en/multimedia-and-resources/pdf/OvercomingRepellencyAndResistanceInCockroaches.pdf](https://pestcontrol.basf.us/content/dam/cxm/agriculture/pest-control/us/en/multimedia-and-resources/pdf/OvercomingRepellencyAndResistanceInCockroaches.pdf)\n\n\\*\\* [https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?\\_from=R40&\\_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&\\_nkw=Phantom+insecticide&\\_sacat=0](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&_nkw=Phantom+insecticide&_sacat=0)\n\n**Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs)**\n\nWhile Gentrol and other IGRs are often used for roach control in commercial settings, it is NOT necessary in residential situations. IGRs take months for their effects to be seen, and using the products above will do the job long before then, so save your money!\n\n**Mixing Alpine**\n\nMix one, two, or three 10g packets to one gallon of water depending on the level of infestation. However, one 10g packet per gallon will be effective as you will usually do two or more passes while spraying. Also, let sit for 5 minutes so it can dissolve, shake, and transfer to the sprayer.\n\n**To mix a single quart, use 1/2 teaspoon of Alpine for a 10g solution (save the rest in a zip lock baggie)**.\n\n**Fogging/bombing** for roaches in an apartment or home ***is not*** recommended as it does not penetrate most harborage areas. However, in very severe infestations, it can kill a number of them but will not replace the methods above.\n\n**Boric acid** and diatomaceous earth (DE) are products I do not advise using, especially around people with respiratory issues, children and pets. They are counter-productive when using Alpine WSG and bait. Also, they are easily over-applied causing possible health issues if they become airborne.\n\n**Boric acid poisoning symptoms:**\n\n[https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/poison/boric-acid-poisoning](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/poison/boric-acid-poisoning)\n\n**Pesticide Dusts**\n\nLike boric acid and DE, dusts are often overapplied by pros and non-pros alike, become airborne during application (and potentially after) and they never degrade. They may have a limited use for bed bug control, but IMO, they are not needed for roach control for safety reasons.\n\n**Baits**\n\nGel bait like *Alpine Rotation 1 or 2\\*, MaxForce, Advion, Vendetta, Invicta* and Combat dry bait stations work well in heavy infestations where there is competition for food. **However, using gel bait in light infestations is a waste as it will not remain fresh for more than a day or two.** What you *can* do it is make bait packets by cutting the corners off a plastic baggie and filling them with any gel bait **other than Advion** (in tests, Advion dries out even in the packets). **T**his will keep the bait fresh for a longer time and allow them to feed through the open side.\n\nAlso, **bait and Alpine can be used together** as Alpine will not pollute the bait. However, avoid directly spraying the bait, but you can place bait on dry areas that were sprayed with Alpine.\n\n\\*Alpine makes two different formulas with the same active ingredient. These are mainly for professional use where bait aversion is possible. For private use, Rotation 1 should be enough.\n\n**Aerosols**\n\n***Raid Max Ant & Roach*** aerosol is a good tool to have (buy locally or online). It comes with an applicator straw attached and can be used to kill/flush roaches out of tight areas like stove and dishwasher controls. A two second blast is enough to drive them out without harming the electronics.\n\n**Glue Traps**\n\nGlue traps are very effective to help with control and for monitoring activity. Some pros may disagree with this, but catching one gravid female means 49 roaches are removed from the playing field, which never hurts. Hoy-Hoy traps have very good reviews, but generic traps will also work.\n\n[https://www.domyown.com/trap-roach-hoyhoy-cockroach-glue-trap-box-of-traps-p-17129.html](https://www.domyown.com/trap-roach-hoyhoy-cockroach-glue-trap-box-of-traps-p-17129.html)\n\n**Caulking**\n\nCaulking cracks and crevices may or may not be beneficial for control as many will be inaccessible.\n\n**Tools**\n\nA bright flashlight, and a vacuum with a HEPA filter that has a hose attachment are recommended. If the vacuum does not have a HEPA filter, wear a good mask. A half-face [respirator](https://www.amazon.com/Active-Carbon-Gases-Chemicals-Respirator/dp/B08SMG33QD/ref=sxin_17_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.cf78a22c-e90f-46b3-9c78-94568bffa550%3Aamzn1.sym.cf78a22c-e90f-46b3-9c78-94568bffa550&crid=1KWZ7BVVECBZD&cv_ct_cx=3m+6200+series+respirator&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.B_pQx0zkxgshbWiYPHZ0mO6v8MgMW1TxXATpXaqoVt8QEOz3QlhaSBmLYvLEQGCl8TE8cWv_au4T8IHX5nXLig.7Nr9H567XChE-RsOE3fKnu3Ubz--wK0ud06XSR3K2b8&dib_tag=se&keywords=3m+6200+series+respirator&pd_rd_i=B08SMG33QD&pd_rd_r=287eb023-15ed-49c9-b43f-3093918abea9&pd_rd_w=if2qn&pd_rd_wg=N6qgH&pf_rd_p=cf78a22c-e90f-46b3-9c78-94568bffa550&pf_rd_r=RTWWBA2VEX1K28JFZNJ6&qid=1728750437&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=3m+6200+series+respirator%2Caps%2C160&sr=1-1-7efdef4d-9875-47e1-927f-8c2c1c47ed49-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM&psc=1) is very affordable.\n\n**Cleaning**\n\nCleaning has obvious benefits but is not crucial to success. I have had to do treatments in many conditions and was still able to get good results, so do what you can and trust the process (obsessive cleaning will wear you out and not make a big difference. However, do not allow dead roaches to lay around so others can 'eat' them and spread the poison).\n\n**Methods**\n\nThe **refrigerator** is always a main breeding area due to compressor heat and condensation. Some fridges have wheels for moving, but if not, empty it and walk it out inch by inch using your body weight (if you have loose vinyl flooring, be careful not to make holes in it with the feet (don't ask me how I know :) far enough to reach the plug, then unplug it, and move it out far enough to get behind it.\n\nIf the fridge has a cardboard cover over the compressor, remove it (flat head screw driver or 1/4\" socket needed), and vacuum the roaches in that area. While you're there, clean the dust on the coils to help the compressor cool better. Then bait and put glue traps anywhere you can on the bottom, and replace the cover as it's needed to help cool the compressor properly. Then spray the floor, lay glue traps all along the wall, walk the fridge back far enough to plug it in, then push it the remaining way. Do this weekly until the glue traps stay clean.\n\nPull out the kitchen drawers and vacuum any roaches, then remove the drawers and vacuum under the counter tops. Vacuum the upper cabinets, above them (if open), and the crevices along the sides. Also, remove electrical outlet covers in infested areas and vacuum inside (DO NOT SPRAY LIQUIDS), apply gel bait and replace covers.\n\nEmpty the vacuum cannister in a plastic bag, tie it off, and put it outside in the trash. If you have a bag vacuum, put one moth ball in the bag or vacuum up a tablespoon of isopropyl alcohol to kill any inside. Return to the kitchen every 15 minutes and vacuum all you see again.\n\nAlso inspect books/bookshelves, wall hangings, pictures, clocks, piles of paper, and closets shelves.\n\n**Stoves**\n\n*Do not* spray the burner top with Alpine as the heat will cause toxic burn-off. Remove the burner grates, vacuum any you see, then lift the top (some will lift; some won’t). If successful, vacuum any you see and do a light aerosol spray in any small openings (older units may have gas pilot lights, so blow them out before spraying, wait five minutes after spraying, and re-light them).\n\nThen remove the burner knobs and do a light aerosol spray in the stove openings (IF there is no pilot light) and check the back of the knobs before reinstalling them. If you see bugs in an electronic display, find an opening to insert the aerosol straw and spray a few one-second bursts. You can also cut the screen around the far edges with a utility knife on three sides to open and clean it. Then use a bit of packing tape to keep it in place, but before you move, seal it with clear caulk.\n\nThen open the oven door, vacuum any you see on the door edges, inside the oven, and on the door hinges, and spray in the hinges with the aerosol. Then pull the bottom drawer out, remove any items, and vacuum. Then remove the drawer, vacuum the floor under the stove, lightly spray Alpine, and place glue traps and bait. Do this weekly until the glue traps stay clear.\n\n**Dishwashers**\n\nOften they will be seen inside the dishwasher seeking water, but if it’s rarely used or broken they *can* breed inside it. Start by spraying Alpine in the door arm openings and around the outside edges, then add bait. If bugs are suspected in the electronics panel, spray aerosol briefly inside it if possible. If the dishwasher is operable, run a cycle with it empty, but don’t spray inside it. If the dishwasher is broken and not going to be repaired, remove the bottom rack, spray Alpine inside it, and put glue traps and bait on the bottom. Also, consider having it removed and disposed of.\n\nThen remove the kick-plate below the dishwasher door with a screwdriver. Vacuum any you see, spray the floor with Alpine (avoid electronics), and place glue traps and bait. Do this weekly until the glue traps stay clear.\n\n**Spray Alpine WSG everywhere you see them,** including floor edges, along the counter back splash (lightly), the undersides of the counter tops, the bottom cabinet edges, behind and around the fridge, under the dishwasher, etc. The edges of upper cabinets that hold dishes and food can be sprayed lightly, then be allowed to dry. Put paper towels down before replacing food and dishes.\n\nSpray every 7-10 days until sightings are greatly reduced; then every 14-28 days. You can apply gel bait along with Alpine (just wait until it dries) as they do not conflict.\n\n**Computer Protection in Active Infestations**\n\nDesk tops: Put the tower on a small, separate table away from the wall. Surround it with a 'glue trap moat (including the legs) and wrap the cords with reversed duct tape. When not using the PC, shut it down and cover the tower, monitor, and keyboard with plastic bags and include a paper towel soaked in alcohol in each to create fumigation chambers.\n\nLaptops: place in a single bag with an alcohol paper towel.\n\nDo the same for game consoles, internet modems, etc.\n\n**Apartment Living**\n\nIf you live in an apartment building and are seeing roaches, call the landlord and have them send a pro to clean out the breeding population. Ideally, a weekly service will bring the quickest results, but most landlords won't go for that, so do what you can between services.\n\nOnce the breeding population is eliminated, it is not uncommon to continue seeing travelers from other units. Unfortunately, this is how it goes and all you can do is apply these techniques and materials. Make plans to move if you can't tolerate this, and if you do, have your next unit inspected by a pro before you sign the lease. Even at that, they can show up from other units at any time.\n\nAlso, if you move into a unit and discover roaches, unless the unit is severely infested, you may not have grounds to break the lease. Leases rarely have clauses that allow termination for insects as they are too common, and the leasing agent will never tell you that there's a current problem (because they'd never get you to sign), so buyer beware. If you are apartment shopping, in each unit you look at, walk the fridge out and see if there are any live or dead roaches. If they unit has them, they will be there.\n\n**Single Homes and RVs**\n\nThese are the easiest infestations to eliminate as there is rarely a near-by source to contend with. However, the source should be identified if they were not there when you moved in or got to the campground.\n\nAre you close to neighbors that are unkempt and may have an issue? Does anyone work or go to school where they are present? Did anyone visit that could have an issue at home? Did you shop recently or get a package delivered? Did you thrift any appliances or furniture?\n\n**Neighbors with a Yard In Between**\n\nIf you have determined that a neighbor is the source, the issue will be worse in the warm months and will stop once temps drop below 50° F. You can spray the grass area between the houses and the house foundation with Temprid FX (but not driveways or sidewalks), you can sprinkle Intice granular bait in a wide pattern, and you can set up glue trap stations along the foundation of the house (they will look for shelter anywhere they can). Also, you will wonder if you should contact local officials and report it, but there is not much they can do but tell them to get a pest service, which the neighbor may or may not do.\n\n**Work, School, etc.**\n\nIf roaches are present at places you frequent, don't bring any bags in the building that you will be taking home, including purses and backpacks (if packing lunch, put it right in the fridge). Use a clear plastic zip-lock for any essentials and keep it zipped.\n\nIf you need to wear a coat, bring a large trash bag and store it in there and tie it tight at the top. Also, inspect yourself well when leaving.\n\n**Vehicles**\n\nDO NOT fog/bomb your car! You can use gel baits, glue traps and spray the floors and crevices with Alpine WSG, but avoid spraying the seats.\n\nYou can also consider using an ozone generator after reviewing all safety precautions. Start by running it in a closed vehicle for one-half hour, then ventilate for one hour. If needed, increase the time incrementally.\n\n**Roach Related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder**\n\nThis is a very real thing, and you are not alone.\n\nOnce they are gone or you move to a new unit, put glue traps out and trust them to tell you that you are still roach-free. Don't look at every speck you see and think it is a roach dropping; they will show themselves if they are present. However, you will be 'on alert' to any real or perceived movements in your environment for the foreseeable future, but this will subside in time. Consider counseling if necessary.\n\nHere's a link that addresses general pest anxiety:\n\n[https://pestech.com/blog/emotional-effects-of-pest-infestations/](https://pestech.com/blog/emotional-effects-of-pest-infestations/)\n\nAlso, if you feel uncomfortable when trying to sleep consider a mosquito net for your bed:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mosquito+bed+nets&crid=F81LGTCYAK5N&sprefix=mosquito+bed+nets%2Caps%2C81&ref=nb\\_sb\\_noss\\_1](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mosquito+bed+nets&crid=F81LGTCYAK5N&sprefix=mosquito+bed+nets%2Caps%2C81&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)\n\n**Lying Liars Lying**\n\nThis is the category most landlords, house techs (at the request of the LL) and neighbors fall into. They will often deny there is a building-wide problem and make you think you are the only one complaining. I know this by the sheer number of reports here of this happening. Often, you are much better off staying quiet about it and fighting them yourself. Otherwise, you will be terribly frustrated on top of having bugs, and may even start believing the lies of the LLL.\n\n**Moving**\n\nWhen moving from an infested unit it’s very easy to take them with you, but not impossible to avoid. Here are some things you can do to help keep that from happening:\n\n* If you can afford to discard items that are infested, do so, but make them unusable so they are not taken by salvagers.\n* Rent a non-climate-controlled storage unit for a month for large items. Spray it with AlpineWSG™, hang a Hot Shot No-Pest Strip™ in it (buy online), and lay glue traps as monitors. Also, a box truck or detached garage will work. Also, A cheap ozone generator will kill any insects in a storage unit. Start by running it for one hour, then ventilate for one hour. If needed, increase the time incrementally. Concentrated ozone is harmful, so follow all safety precautions.\n* Launder clothes and put them directly in plastic bags.\n* Some things can be put in the freezer for 12 hrs., then bagged and sealed.\n* Electronics can be put in a plastic bag with a paper towel soaked in isopropyl alcohol for 12 hrs.\n\n**Odor Control**\n\nHeavy infestations will produce a musky-sweet type smell from all the droppings and sheds. Removing as much as you can and disinfecting will help, but sometimes it's not enough, so you can try EarthCare Odor Bags and open boxes of baking soda to help absorb the odor.\n\n[https://www.domyown.com/search?w=earthcare+odor+bags&search=](https://www.domyown.com/search?w=earthcare+odor+bags&search=)\n\n**When Is It Over?**\n\nIn a single home, assuming the initial cause of the infestation has been 100% eliminated, two weeks with no sightings would be a fair test.\n\nIn an apartment, a week or two with minimal or no sightings means that the breeding population is eradicated. However, you will always be at risk for invaders from other units, so be vigilant.\n\n**A Personal Note:**\n\nIf you have saved money by using this information, consider a small donation to a local animal shelter as a thank you.\n\nAlso:\n\nI provide this help to you as a service to the Lord, and pray you will accept the gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ.\n\n(See John 3:16 / John 3:3 in the New Testament)\n\nPC Duranet",

        "body": "Looks like an easy fix, tbh. Others have already said it, but I’ll say it anyway just to emphasize that it’s not a lost cause and you don’t need to spend big bucks to get this done in a shop. \n\n1. Least aggressive option first: If there’s still sticker residue left, get it off with heat gun/blow dryer, a microfiber cloth and if necessary a soft plastic scraper. Then properly clean first with soap water, then with isopropyl alcohol.\n\n2. If the scratches disappear when you make the area wet, it means they are just surface scratches and you can polish them out. Get compound for the rough sanding and polish for the fine sanding/polish. A power tool with a buffing wheel will make this very quick but if you don’t already have a tool and wheel attachment and you don’t want to spend the money, do it by hand with a few microfiber buffing pads. Rub with compound until scratches are gone, then polish with polish.\n\n3. Optional, but I like to go over surface scratch repairs with a layer of clear coat to build the coat back up to thickness. Lots of YouTube videos on how to do that. If you do this, step 2 will be different. You’ll want to sand the area with about 1000 grit, then spray the clear coat, then even it out with compound and polish. Again, YouTube is your friend.\n\nIf the scratches go down into the paint or body metal layer, you’ll have to repaint. Also not a big deal. Just get educated on YouTube and diy it. Not much to it. Definitely beats spending 100s on a shop repair and when it looks all shiny and perfect in the end you can look at it and say you did that yourself 🙂\n\nGood luck!",

I will then pour some salt into the peice and put just enough hot water to get all the salt moving; shake vigorously! Then drain out the water and salt, give it another good rinse. Finally put more salt in there and iso alcohol, about the same amount of alcohol as you had water in the previous step. IF YOU DONT HAVE MUCH ALCOHOL YOU CAN CUT IT WITH SOME HOT WATER.

Bearing the age of this story in mind, I apologize if things are a bit fuzzy.\n\nOk, this is from when I was in college, getting my IT degree. To support myself I was working in fast food and once my major was known I became the go to person for any of my co-workers with a computer problem. It was a way to make a little extra money on the side so I didn't mind the resultant flood of often inane little issues. Except once.\n\nOne of my co-workers was an older guy, been working fast food all his life, surviving on just above minimum wage with all that implies. To say he lived in a poor neighborhood would be an understatement. I drove him home a few times and, well, let's just say I was sketched out by his neighborhood. Anyway, when he came to me with a busted computer I was a bit surprised but I agreed to take a look. I put his computer in my car and locked the door and left it until my shift was over.\n\nNow, my shift ended when the fast food place closed and we cleaned up, let's just call it oh god why o'clock. I climbed in the car and made my weary way home. About half way home I realized that I was hearing this weird rustling sound from my passenger seat, where I'd strapped the computer for transport. Out of curiosity I pulled over and turned the dome light on and took a better look at the computer in my possession. About the time I was getting suspicious of the brown streaks on the case something darted out of the back and booked it for under the seat. With a reflexive swat, and a disgusting crunch, I realized that the \"something\" was a roach. And the volume of the rustling coming from the computer meant it wasn't alone. My first instinct was to unstrap the computer and pitch it overboard. Reluctantly I decided against that action and gingerly made my way home. When I got there I parked as far away from the apartment building as I could and called it a night, it was simply too late to properly handle what had to come next.\n\nThe next day I borrowed my roommate's car, explaining why mine wasn't available, and went out and bought a bug bomb. I wasn't sure how that'd work in a car, but hell if I wasn't going to do something to make sure my car was clean. I also grabbed some heavy duty roach spray. When I got back, I took the computer out to a nice sunny spot in the parking lot far from any cover and loosened the screws holding the case closed. I then sprayed a big circle around it with the roach spray and, spray still in hand, gingerly levered the case open and stepped back. The resulting flood of scattering roaches that came boiling out of that thing was impressive as hell. I was torn between throwing up and fleeing in stark terror. Instead, I just sprayed hell out of the computer and the swarm until the can ran dry. That plus hot blacktop made sure that little, if any, of them made it away. And I made sure my position meant they'd flee *away* from the complex.\n\nLeaving the computer open in the sun I went back to my car, cleared out the vulnerable stuff and chucked in the bomb, leaving my windows cracked a tad. I then hung about for the 15 minutes or so for it to do its job and then rolled down my windows to let the car air out fully. This also gave the computer 15 minutes in direct sun to encourage any stragglers to take a hike. Hopefully.\n\nI then lugged the computer over to the dumpster and, after resisting the urge to just chuck it in I shook as many of the dead roaches out onto the top of the case I had removed as I could and used that to transfer them into the dumpster. I then moved the computer to the sidewalk in front of my apartment complex, went inside for my screwdriver set, isopropyl alcohol, canned air, q-tips, and a hand broom, dustpan, and trash bag. \n\nI sat right there on the sidewalk, because screw bringing that disaster inside, and surveyed the work ahead of me. There was still a liberal dusting of dead cockroaches. Under that was a coating of a mixture of crushed corpses, dust, and cockroach crap. For the third time I considered just chucking the computer, but I knew this guy and how much he had to have sacrificed to afford even an older computer and I had to at least try. \n\nThe canned air blew out the loose stuff and allowed me to pry free the cards and cables. From there the motherboard came out somewhat okay, though finding the screws was a bitch. Removed the hard drive, floppy drive, and the drive bays and power supply until the case was empty. I then took the case inside and scrubbed it in the bathroom until it came clean (ew,ew,ew).  Then went outside and carefully swabbed every contact point on every piece of that computer with alcohol. I couldn't get rid of all traces of the catastrophe, but I made sure that all the important points got cleaned up. Again, ew, ew, ew. It took hours and most of the bottle of alcohol and ever swab I had. I then carefully put everything back together.\n\nNow, at this point I had no idea if the computer had survived all this. My cleaning hadn't found any obvious damage, charring, melting, warping, or bent or broken connectors. With a shrug, I lugged the computer inside and set it up with a spare monitor, keyboard, and mouse. I plugged it all in, hit the power switch, crossed my fingers... and the damn thing POSTed. Son of a bitch, I'd revived the dead. And the ancient, it turned out to be a 286 with 1 meg of memory, a ten meg hard drive, running DOS 5.0. Roughly ten years out of date at that point, but priceless to this guy. I'd done my duty, and then some. \n\nI took a shower, caught a nap, and went back in for my next shift. I caught the guy when he came in, letting him know that I'd fixed his computer and it was in my car. I'd hand it over when I got off work for the night, since he was working closing and I wasn't. I then let him know I was charging double my normal rate and he was never, NEVER, to come to me with another problem. And he should have warned me about this one. We shook hands, I'd made his night, and he said he completely undrstood and apologized. He'd just been so ashamed he hadn't known what to say. \n\nAnd that was that, my first, and luckily last, encounter with literal computer bugs. I graduated a few months after that and quit fast food shortly thereafter when I got my first job in my field. Helpdesk, mind, which came with its own problems but those are their own stories for another time.",

Most of the time they blame it on the expansion pack or something.\n\nWell I can speak personally on this.\n\nI have several N64s. All of them work just fine. But one of them, which I picked up at Goodwill (when Goodwill still actually had shit), would always freeze when playing Donkey Kong 64. Yes, DK64 does use an expansion pack. But that wasn't the culprit. \n\nI found if I blew a fan across the console while playing it, the game wouldn't freeze.\n\nSo I opened it up, took out the old thermal pads (which broke apart as soon as I removed them btw), cleaned the surfaces with isopropyl alcohol, added Artic MX-5 to everywhere there was a thermal pad (and between the heat sink plates for good measure), and now it runs good as new. Probably better actually, given that the modern thermal paste is far superior to the old thermal pads. (I borrowed this image from another user's post to use as reference, since I didn't take pictures of mine.)\n\nI did nothing involving the expansion pack. I didn't swap it for another, or make any modifications in that regard. It is an original N64 expansion pack. The same kind that I had in my system as a kid (which I still have, and still works.)\n\nThis problem hasn't been fully acknowledged yet by the N64 community, but some of these original thermal pads out there are starting to go. It doesn’t seem like every N64 is affected yet. The reason only some N64s are showing signs of thermal pad breakdown could be caused by a variety of reasons. It could be how hard they were played back in the day, the conditions in which they were stored, possible changes in thermal pad manufacturing throughout the N64's life cycle, or simply age. \n\nBut I believe this issue is going to continue to come up more and more in the coming years.",

Basically this ripple, induces heat in silicon junctions (and also causes bit errors in logic, causing crashes), adding to the thermal sources. It's kind of a cascade effect. Once one cap fails in the chain, everything after that cap starts failing (because ripple induces heating). And it usually happens at the power supply first and works its way down.\n\n\nNow here's the rub. That same degradation also happens in these silicon junctions, given time. So just applying thermal paste merely masks the underlying cause of the crashing.\n\n\nBasically, replace all the electrolytic capacitors and see if the crashing goes away (and if you have an oscilloscope, measure all voltage lines, before and after and report back).

        "body": "Okay, so, not to rain on the parade or anything here, but this may be premature advice for several reasons.\n\nThe first is that this, as a sample size and experiment, isn't nearly thorough enough to establish that overheating is an issue for N64s. Running a fan over the console may cause cooling to other components that aren't affected by the heatsink, which could be part of the problem. In addition, \"overheating\" as an issue in-and-of-itself usually indicates that a component is at a temperature above its maximum operating range. Many desktop processors and GPUs, for example, have 105c set as a \"critical\" trip point to either shut down the device or maximize throttling. Without having measured the on-chip temperatures of your processors beforehand, it's impossible to guess how much of a difference this made, or how much of an issue overheating was to begin with.\n\nIf a chip temperature of 65-75c is enough of an issue to cause freezing, then other components are likely suspect. Another commenter mentioned capacitor aging, which I think is a far more likely culprit. ~~In addition, you have an UltraPIF installed here, which makes it even harder to isolate out processor overheating (fyi, I'm using \"processor\" as a general term - the affected components are both RAM chips as well as the CPU and RCP) as the central issue.~~ edit: scratch that, picture isn't OP's console, he specified that & I missed it\n\nThe second major issue is how you've fixed the overheating issue. You *(generally)* should **not** replace a thermal pad with thermal paste. Thermal paste is designed to fill very tiny gaps between a heat generator and a heat conductor (ie: processor and heatsink) that are closely mounted/mated together, and the type of thermal paste is application specific. You will notice a thick, greasy, white thermal paste used on high-power transistors (as seen in audio amps, among other things) - this is specifically silicone thermal paste, which does not perform as well as something like MX-5 but has anti-conductivity properties (among other things) that make it application appropriate. Silicone thermal paste should be replaced with silicone thermal paste, and likewise, thermal pads should **only** be replaced with thermal pads.\n\nThe thickness of the pad material is a factor in the design of the heatsink. The N64 uses thermal pads in its original design, and the clearances/spacing are designed for that. The biggest indicator there is that the heatsink does *not* actually secure directly onto any of the components it is cooling. The upper heatsink secures to the lower heatsink using the RF shielding of the console to loosely secure it in place, and the overall rigidity/weight of the assembly keeps the multi-piece heatsink/RF shield assembly loosely attached to the components intended to be cooled. Key takeaway: Unlike a desktop computer, **there is no (significant) clamping force between the chips being cooled and the heatsink.** Which means the gap will be variable in size, capable of shifting, and will *not* be able to press closely enough together to vacate excess thermal paste, and may leave gaps if the heatsink ever shifts in position. This, in turn, will lead to suboptimal cooling performance.\n\nTo summarize: It's premature to assert that N64s will be having overheating issues, and it is *very* inadvisable to use any old thermal paste in place of the original thermal pads, which may end up being incompatible with the chips' exterior casing (which is a ceramic or plastic, not metal) in the long run.\n\nTo the OP and any others reading this concerned about their console overheating: **Do NOT use thermal paste on your N64. New replacement thermal pads for the N64 are available online inexpensively.** If you are concerned your thermal pads have worn out (which they can! they can compress over time and make poor contact, which I think is part of OP's original issue), and feel comfortable replacing them, do so with new thermal pads.",

    "body": "With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, and lockdowns/quarantines of varying degrees taking place around the world, more people than ever are turning to playing their DnD games online. This thread is intended to serve as an official subreddit response to answer questions about how to move your game from in person to online, but players looking to start new games may also find this thread helpful if they want to start an online-only game.\n\n## What You Need\n\n### Computers & Connections\n\nEvery player will need a computer that can connect to the internet. The hardware needs are modest, so anything can run Skype should suffice. You will need a stable internet connection, and if you choose to use video to see other players you may need to worry about bandwidth, especially during peak usage periods throughout the day.\n\n### Voices & Videos\n\nYou will need a microphone of some kind (unless you want to play by typing everything), and optionally a webcam. These don't need to be spectacular, but obviously better audio and video quality can improve the experience. If you have a smart phone, that may be sufficient.\n\nYou will also need something to connect everyone. It's essentially conference call, so anything that can handle group phone calls will work.\n\nSome examples are listed below. This is not a personal or official endorsement of any of these products; the subreddit and its moderators have no relationship, personal or professional, with anyone associated with these products. \n\n* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)\n* [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/)\n* [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/)\n* FaceTime\n* [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)\n* [Slack](https://slack.com/)\n* [WebEx](https://www.webex.com/)\n* [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)\n\n### Tabletops & Tokens\n\nIf you play by \"theater of the mind\", audio/video of the other players is sufficient. If your group uses a map, tokens, etc. you will need a \"virtual tabletop\" to replicate that capability.\n\nHere is a small list of virtual tabletop options with an extremely brief summary of their merits. Again: no affiliation with the products, etc. etc. you get the point, we're not making money off of this.\n\n* [Ardent Roleplay](https://ardentroleplay.com/): Use augmented reality and your phone to see 3d miniatures. The creators shared an [official guide for remote play](https://ardentroleplay.com/2020/04/30/remote-play-and-rpgs-in-2020-online-tools-for-adventurers-in-quarantine/) in the comments of this thread.\n* [Astral Tabletop](https://www.astraltabletop.com/): Free, with paid premium features. Premium features are free through April to encourage people to move their games online.\n* [Dungeon Digital](https://dungeon.digital/): Very simple dungeon creator and campaign manager made by /u/sabotah\n* [Fantasy Groumds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php): A long-standing player in the virtual tabletop market. Requires purchase up front, but free after that. Needs to be installed on each player's computer.\n* [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/): A self-hosted VTT. Currently in beta, but has support for mods and 3rd-party content.\n* [MapTool](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/maptool/): Free and open source. Good Fog of War functionality.\n* [Microsoft Whiteboard](https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/): Technically not a virtual tabletop, but it's free, easy to use, and handles having images dropped onto it very well. You'll need a separate solution for rolling dice and for voice/video.\n* [roll20](https://roll20.net/): Robust, free, and runs in a browser with a premium subscription that adds stuff like dynamic lighting and dynamic lines of sight. Has built-in audio and video, but it's not great so most people use a separate audio/video solution in conjunction with roll20.\n* [RollDiceWithFriends](http://rolldicewithfriends.com/): Online group dice roller. Great if you're using a VTT or chat client without built-in dice functionality.\n* [Schmeppy](https://shmeppy.com/): Virtual \"wet erase mat\" designed for quickly drawing dungeons. The site describes itself as \"earliest access\", but the creator /u/itsjoncs us active in the comments on this thread.\n* [TablePlop](https://tableplop.com/): Browser-based VTT built with simplicity in mind.\n* [Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/): Simulates playing at a table. I haven't used it so I can't speak to specifics, but please comment below if you can provide a brief description.\n* [RPG+](https://www.appmindedapps.com/rpg.html): Mobile app with 3d virtual tabletop, character sheets, and built-in chat.\n\nPlease inform me if you know of or use other virtual tabletops so that I can expand this list.\n\n## Other Ways to Play Tabletop Games Online\n\n* [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/join): Play board games online\n* [Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/)\n* Yora: Mobile app built as a multiplayer D&D-style RPG experience. ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triclap.yora) / [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yora-multiplayer-rpg/id1473115769))\n\n## Additional Reading\n\n* [DnDBeyond's official guide to playing online](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/750-new-players-guide-how-to-play-d-d-online)\n* [Finding/Forming a Group](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/wiki/social_issues#wiki_forming_a_group)\n* [WotC's official guide to playing online](https://dnd.wizards.com/remote) (Includes a bunch of free content from DMsGuild)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs a personal request: Please stay safe. Practice social distancing, wash your hands, and don't touch your face. Consider washing your dice using household cleaners like a bleach solution or isopropyl alcohol (60% concentration or higher). (Please don't ruin your dice, though. I don't know how whatever weird mammoth bone material your dice are made from will react to any given liquid.)\n\nEven if you don't get to continue your game for a while, check in with your friends frequently. Staying isolated can be emotionally taxing for a lot of people, and maintaining social relationships without face to face contact is difficult. Get people together to play board games or video games online, even if it's just one-on-one and even if it's just for a few minutes.",

No matter what VTT you use, use a Discord server for group communication. Not only is it more reliable, but you also have a nice place for a small community to chat and socialize in-between sessions.

Though it's still early in development, I've found it to be a fantastic alternative to Roll20, having better stability, many more quality of life features and unparalleled community module support. I'll go down a quick list:\n\n* Dungeon walls can be made and merged more easily, and there are all kinds of different walls, like invisible walls that prevent movement, terrain walls that partially obscure vision, ethereal walls that block vision but do not restrict movement, and so on.\n* You can mark doors that people can open with a click, lock those same doors, or make them secret to players for them to discover!\n* You can drag and drop [AoE templates!](https://ibb.co/gDc76L6) You can also make them stick to tokens, and apply textures to them.\n* There's a robust journal system where you can easily link one entry to another by dragging and dropping the entry into the text box while you're writing.\n* You can upload music and sounds for usage in your sessions. A certain community module even allows for \"hype tracks\" that can play on certain characters' turns in combat, or when a certain item is found. Ambient noises can also be applied in a radius to different parts of a map. Works great for immersion.\n* There's a full-fledged lighting system, where you drop a light source and drag out the radius. You can do this anywhere on a map, and it fully bounces off of walls and creates shadows behind them! The lights' level of brightness and colors can be customized. The light system is also more optimized than Roll20's, with minimal performance drop.\n* You can customize compendiums, and even make your own. Entries can be dragged into character sheets or the game's journal/item/character sections.\n* You can make your own rollable tables very easily. These are neatly organized in a window that you can roll straight from, and you can link entries from your journals or your compendiums.\n* You can add your own systems to the client. Currently, DnD 5e, Pathfinder 2e, Numenera and Warhammer Fantasy 4e have been made for it. An generic system is also provided for those who use systems not yet implemented, but still want to use Foundry's features. As the client gets developed, more will surely come with it.\n* Speaking of creation, check out [all of these modules.](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/Community-Modules) Some of them further improve the client with QoL features, like [Playlist Import](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/Community-Modules/#playlist-import), [Better Rolls](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/Community-Modules/#better-rolls-for-5e) and [The Furnace](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/Community-Modules/#the-furnace). Some of them add wildly new functions, like [Calendar/Weather](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/Community-Modules/#calendarweather) (allows you to make a full calendar for your game. It also simulates seasons, yearly events and weather. You can even customize the passage of time, having the clock set to advance either in real time or at whatever interval you set) and [Theatre Inserts](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/Community-Modules/#theatre-inserts) (adds a visual novel-esque interface where characters can slide onstage, and both the GM and players can interact through them. It has customizable text styles and emoji-style emotes to help signify their moods. I find this great to help players know who's talking in a scene, and I can see it being incredibly helpful for play-by-post games)\n\nSo yeah, I think Foundry's great. It has incredible potential and its development is not slowing down. You do need to pay [5 dollars a month](https://www.patreon.com/foundryvtt/overview) to get access to it, but this is for the full version, and once it's fully released, you only need to pay a one-time fee to keep it forever. I'm really excited to see what comes next for it.",

    "body": "While not as nuclear as some stories I've read, proportionate to the \"crime\" I'd say this counts.  Set the WABAC machine to the year 2000.   I'm living in a crappy apartment over a store front, so parking was limited.  Now this was the middle of winter, and I didn't have a car at that period in my life, but my girlfriend at the time did.  She was coming over in a couple hours, and finding parking on the street is a gamble, so I wanted to dig out a parking spot for her out of the snow bank in the alley behind my building.\n\nI didn't own a snow shovel, so using a hammer, old plastic ice cream bucket, and my bare hands I dug out a chunk about 3m by 2m by 2m to make room for her to park.  I don't know if you can appreciate how much snow that is, but it was a LOT of work, especially considering my lack of proper equipment.  This isn't fresh fallen snow either, this a snowbank packed by a plow.  Practically ice.  But whatever, we do crazy things for love, right?  But apparently I had too much faith in humanity.  I thought the cardboard sign I left in the newly-cleared parking spot that said \"I spent an hour and a half digging this out for someone specific--please do not park here,\" would be enough.\n\nNope.  Wouldn't be writing this if it had been.  Naturally some thundercunt of a Lexus owner threw the sign in the dumpster and stole the spot.  (I remember it was red.  I was gonna post a link to a pic of a car that resembles it but A: I see the rules prohibit links, and B: it's kind of irrelevant anyway.)  I hadn't told my girlfriend about my plan to dig out the parking spot, mostly because I didn't want to look like a wuss if it was too much work and I gave up.  So I just stewed on it, imagining all the things I could do.\n\nMy girlfriend ended up finding a spot on the street a block away, and we had a good evening anyway.   She had to work the next day, so she took off around 2am, and I stayed up until maybe around 4am.  The car was still there, and I was still pissed.  By this time all the bars were closed, the neighbors were asleep, and the streets were quiet.  Couldn't ask for a better opportunity to ruin someone's shit.  I went outside with a bottle of anhydrous isopropanol I kept around as a solvent, doused the car's tires, and set them on fire.  I nabbed the cardboard sign from the dumpster and used it to quickly scrape the snow and cover my tracks, then took it back inside with me. No point leaving evidence behind.\n\nOver the course of the next few minutes I heard BANG.....KAPOW....BLAM....BOOOM...as the tires burst one by one.  I had honestly expected the whole car to go up in flames, but each burst was apparently forceful enough to put out each individual tire, as well as blast out a sizeable divot in the snowpack.  Nothing happened until the next day, but police were eventually called.  They were knocking on doors, asking if anyone saw something.  Nope sorry, must've slept right through it.  Good luck officer, hope you catch the guy.  I turned on my police scanner to keep tabs on things, mostly out of fear of getting caught.  But there were no witnesses, and I learned the owner only had liability insurance.  What kind of idiot buys a Lexus but not full coverage?  I would soon find out.\n\nWhen I went outside to survey my handiwork under the guise of taking out the trash and being a curious resident, oh man yeah that guy was gonna need to get his WHOLE car resprayed.  The car looked fine structurally but I did probably more than 2 grand worth of cosmetic damage, not to mention needing 4 new tires.  I also got a look at the guy who owned the car, and the image I had created in my head of what a person would look like that would so unapologetically steal someone's hard work...was completely accurate.  He was a grade A first class board-certified textbook Douchebag.  Orange fake tan, way too much hair product, leather pants...weapons-grade douchery, a decade before Jersey Shore was a thing.  I regret nothing.\n\nNever saw that car again.  Got away scot free.\n\nEdit: And as expected with every story, you get the legions of people trying to poke holes in it, saying things like \"Alcohol doesn't burn hot enough\", yaddi yaddi yaddi.  Well guess what, apparently it does, because we had a Lexus with four popped tires.  I'm not sure if the tires actually caught fire, or if the heat of the flame just caused the pressure to go up to the point that the tires burst.  All's I know is I lit 4 tires on fire with 100% isopropyl alcohol, and 4 tires popped.  If someone wants to do the math and figure it out, fine.\n\nEdit 2: To address some further comments, it was indeed a small bottle of isopropanol, no larger than 1 liter.  It wasn't like I made sure to thoroughly saturate the tires, I was aiming to get in and out without getting caught.  It was like blub-blub move on to the next, blub blub, move on to the next, etc.  I smoked at the time so I either lit the fires with cardboard matches or a simple cheap ass butane lighter, I don't remember which.  But those were my main cigarette lighting tools, so it would've been one of those.  I probably went with a butane lighter, but again that's a detail I simply don't recall specifically.  Again, I seriously thought the tires would catch fire and the whole car would end up torched, but for whatever reason the four tires popped and that plus some smoke damage and bubbled paint was the extent of it.\n\nFinal Edit: Yes, this happened.  Anyone who says it's not possible is objectively, empirically wrong.  It happened.  I was there.  I know.  But whatever, it's a story from almost two decades ago, it's past the statute of limitations for property damage, and frankly I JDGAF at this point.  You're free to disbelieve it and be wrong if you want.  Whatever.",

The light material would only dust off a layer of snow, not cover a boot/shoe track. You would literally have to dig the cardboard into the snow to destroy a track...then the investigator will see a 1 - 2 foot wide cardboard mark. \n\n3) How did you start the fire? You must have doused 4 tires, then lit one by one. Did you spark an igniter pile or the tire? Also few minutes? To get a cold tire to explode...you must have used more than a bottle of anhydrous isopropanol and that would have cooked more of the car.",

I’m not affiliated with any brand but I can see how some may feel negatively towards this, especially considering some of the history on the sub for brands to exploit the readers here. \n\nI may make a separate post later with recommendations as well as a bit of a discussion around it for people who are looking for recommendations. \n\n—-\n\nHi guys!\n\nYears ago I wrote[ the sidebar'd piece about dehydrated skin that I still get tagged in today](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/22c4tf/dehydrated_skin_and_the_moisture_barrier_an/). I wanted to update that with some more detailed information and knowledge on why it happens, what is happening, et cetra. Hopefully this can replace that guide, since I feel like it was a bit too broad. :)\n\n---\n\nDehydration is characterized by a lack of hydration in the cellular system and intercellular channels of the skin. It is not a skin type, but a skin condition. It does not discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin types, and is frequently aggravated by lifestyle and skincare choices. \n\nTo understand skin dehydration, you need to first understand the role of the natural moisturizing factors (NMF) in skin hydration. The NMF is an invisible lipid composition that sits on the top layer of the stratum corneum (SC) as well as interwoven in the top most layers of corneocytes (skin cells), making up a part in what is considered the \"acid mantle\" of the skin. The term NMF first appeared in 1959, but was not universally adopted immediately. It is hydrosoluable (able to dissolve in water) and hygroscopic (able to retain water), composed of about 40% free amino acids, 12% pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA), 12% lactates, 8.5% sugars/peptides/inorganic acids, 7% urea, 6% chloride, 5% sodium, and various small amounts of other materials. \n\nIt serves three major functions:\n\n1.  Protecting skin from damage\n2.  Encouraging desquamation (exfoliation of the upper most layer of corneocytes)\n3.  Controlling permeability of the SC\n\nThe NMFs are very effective natural humectants, drawing moisture to the skin from the atmosphere, even at humidity as low as 50%. \"Hydrated NMF forms ionic interacts with keratin fibers, reducing the intermolecular forces between the fibers and thus increasing the elasticity of the stratum corneum.\"² This keeps the skin healthy and supple in appearance. It also serves to prevent excessive water influx (see the third major function above), such as when your skin wrinkles from being in the bath or shower for too long, which causes the corneocytes to shrink. \n\nWhile it is often thought that the stratum corneum is \"dead\" tissue, it still requires water to function effectively. The NMF serves to provide for this, drawing and holding much of the water required. For example, enzymes that cause skin cells to exfoliate away naturally, by breaking the various bonds holding corneocytes together, need water to do their job effectively. \n\nReduction or stripping away of the NMF results in dry skin ([known as xerosis](https://imgur.com/vBOb07w)), scaling, flaking, as well as fissuring and cracking ([such as severely cracked and dry heels](https://imgur.com/C0F7BKK)). It can also result in what we refer to as \"dehydrated skin\" (though this is not a medical term).\n\n* * *\n\nWhat Dehydration Feels Like\n===========================\n\nDehydrated skin is one of the more difficult conditions to diagnose because it is frequently invisible. There are many \"tips\" online about how to diagnose dehydrated skin, such as pinching the back of your hand to see how quickly the skin snaps back into place. *It's important to keep in mind that this only serves to show if your body is dehydrated. Dehydrated skin usually has less to do about the hydration inside of your body and more to do with how we treat the skin topically or the atmosphere around us.* This is why someone with dehydrated skin can pinch the back of their hand and see their skin immediately pop back into place, yet feel horrible irritation on their skin when applying a simple moisturizer.  \n\n[The skin usually looks dry, scaly, or flaky](https://imgur.com/cLTwbTf), and feels \"tight\" (such as after using a harsh cleanser). When pulled very gently, [it can appear to crinkle](https://imgur.com/8RRFIfj) (not to be confused with crepey skin, such as the skin appearance around joints), and can even look like it has a very thin layer of skin sitting atop the upper most layer of skin. In some people, it feels itchy. It is usually most evident on the forehead or nose. It can also look lackluster, dull, and lack \"bounce\" and suppleness. In some, it can take the form of crinkly but very shiny skin, usually due to abuse of skin remodelers like AHAs or BHAs. \n\nBoth dry and oily skin types can be dehydrated - dry skin because it struggles to hold onto moisture and oily because sufferers frequently use harsh cleansers or astringents to gain relief. According to Milady's Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary, \"When oily skin becomes dehydrated, the surface layers of cells harden ... and block oil secretion. The result is an entrapment of the oils under the stratum corneum layer. This is particularly detrimental in the case of someone with acne because it also results in the entrapment of the infection.\"¹ \n\nDehydrated skin also typically responds more viciously to active ingredients, such as BHAs, AHAs, sulfur, retinoids, and vitamin C. It can also respond to completely benign ingredients, creating a burning sensation or the skin feeling flushed and hot.\n\n* * *\n\nCauses of Dehydration\n=====================\n\nThe most common culprits of dehydration of the skin is stripping cleansers, harsh soaps, and hot water, though a host of other causes can come into play for some people, including skin conditions that aggravate dry skin (again, while dehydrated skin is not the same as dry skin, dry skin is especially prone to dehydration) or create acne (which frequently causes people to \"overtreat\" the acne and strip their skin).\n\nSkin Conditions\n---------------\n\n*   Atopic dermatitis\n*   Irritant contact dermatitis\n*   Psoriasis\n*   Cutaneous lymphoma\n\nEnvironmental\n-------------\n\n*   Seasonal changes\n*   Dry air (low humidity)\n*   Flowing air (especially wind)\n*   UV radiation (tanning beds, the sun)\n*   Overwashing\n*   Age\n*   Sunburn\n*   Cigarette smoking and smoke exposure\n*   Friction (including harsh scrubbing and mechanical exfoliation tools like the Clarisonic)\n\nHeredity Disorders\n------------------\n\n*   Ichthyosis vulgaris\n*   Netherton syndrome\n\nHormonal\n--------\n\n*   Hypothyroidism\n*   Estrogen deficiency\n\nTopical\n-------\n\n*   Alcohol/isopropyl alcohol/SD alcohol/denatured alcohol\n*   Drinking alcohol\n*   Essential oils\n*   Clay masks\n*   Sodium lauryl sulfate\n*   Bar soap\n*   Astringents (particularly alcohol-based astringents)\n*   Topical medications (e.g. retinoids)\n*   Excessive AHA or BHA use\n\n* * *\n\nCaring for Dehydrated Skin\n==========================\n\nThe most important thing when solving dehydrated skin is consideration of the products you use as well as your environment. This means paying special attention to the ingredients label when shopping, being cautious about what is applied to the skin, and what your home environment is like (and potentially limiting outside exposure to harsh wind and sun). \n\nSince everything starts with your cleanser, this means picking a creamier cleanser or one with lower amounts of surfactants. I've done a whole post on cleansers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), if you'd like to read about all the various types of cleansers and how they work. The long and short of it is look for either a wipe-off cleansers, such as Albolene; an oil cleanser that emulsifies (rinses clean) in water, such as my beloved Clinique Take the Day off Balm; a creamy cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Aquanil; or a gentle sudsing cleanser, such as Paula's Choice Hydralight or CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. Avoid washing with hot water, which reduces the size of the micelles (the molecules created from surfactants, which cluster together), allowing them to penetrate deeper into the skin and strip it further. You'll also want to completely avoid bar soaps (pH is too high), micellar water (can be much more irritating), makeup wipes (same as micellar water), and harsh cleansers that make your skin feel tight after cleansing. \n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate. \n\nMoisturizers are also a cornerstone in treating dehydrated skin. Humectants are especially important. Some humectants to look for:\n\n*   **Glycerin** - A well-established humectant, it is a clear, thick liquid that is usually sticky on it's own. It is derived from combining water and fat, usually vegetable oil. It is not typically irritating, but it can be to some people in high concentrations.\n*   **Hyaluronic Acid (HA)** - A component of glycosaminoglycan, it occurs naturally in the dermis of the skin and is thought to play a very important role in skin function. It is advertised frequently as holding up to \"1000\" times it's weight in water (citation needed). When applied, \"hyaluronic acid forms a viscoelastic film in a manner similar to the way it holds water in the intercellular matrix of dermal connective tissue.\"¹ It needs application regularly to be effective, frequently breaking down in skin 24-48 hours after application (note: this is not the case with HA injections). It is best applied to damp skin, straight out of the shower.\n*   **Urea** - While it is frequently considered more of a moisturizer or keratolytic (able to break down bonds on dead skin) ingredient, urea has humectant properties and can attract and hold moisture in the SC.\n\n* * *\n\nHealing Dehydrated Skin\n=======================\n\nArmed with the proper ingredients, skin can typically bounce back within about two weeks (14 days). Once healed, skin should be maintained with ingredients and products that are beneficial to the skin's health. \n\nWhile healing dehydrated skin, it is recommended to use the most bland routine possible and avoid trying new things and any active ingredients at all. _It should go without saying that to heal dehydrated skin, you must drop the products that are creating the problem in the first place._ If you must change out one or two products that you believe were causing your dehydration, do so slowly and one at a time, starting with any cleansers and then moving on to moisturizers. \n\nPetrolatum is helpful to some people as well, but can cause problems for others. This is possibly due to it's ability to diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin in some people, which interferes with recovery. Your mileage may vary. \n\nIt is also recommended to sleep with a humidifier if you are in a particularly dry climate. You want to shoot for somewhere between 40-60% indoor humidity, as this will prevent the humectants from drawing moisture from the deeper layers of the skin, which evaporates away.\n\n* * *\n\nSources\n=======\n\n1.

    "body": "Ever have one of those nights where you just have to use a crowbar?\n\nTonight gentle readers, we shall speak of doors, and the opening therof. Sorry it's been a while, but this is a college town, and it gets a bit slow during the summertime. Buttercup the emotional support unicorn is over in her paddock, should anyone wish to brush and braid her mane.\n\nSo there I was, enjoying an otherwise uneventful night shift. I had polished off the last of dinner (small potatoes, with butter, garlic and herbs, nom nom) and was relaxing before audit, when a woman comes up to the desk. Her key isn't working. Not a problem, this happens all the time, here you go new key, have a nice night.\n\nThen she comes back. This gets my attention.\n\nKey still isn't working? Okay, this isn't good. Get the Emergency Key, grab some batteries, and put up the \"Back Soon\" sign. Let's go have a look.\n\nFirst problem: I cannot find the small torx screwdriver that opens the battery panel on our locks. We only have *one*, and it's not where it's supposed to be. Or where it's not supposed to be. A quick check of several locations fails to locate it. Fine... I can get it open with a small flathead, but it's not easy. Why yes, I have had this problem before.\n\nThe second problem is that our override box is missing, and has been for two years. Current theory is that one of the homeless folks staying with us at the time walked off with it. They're *expensive* to replace, and so we haven't. It's an issue, but generally not a problem except when we need the ability to unlock a broken lock. And that's what I need.\n\nOkay, so basic lock troubleshooting. Check brand new (not copied) keys. Nope. Red light. Emergency Key. Nope. Red light. Okay, let's get that panel off and change the batteries. Takes some finagling, but done, nice fresh batteries in place. Nope. Red light.\n\nThis is a bad sign. Fresh batteries and an E-Key should open every door every time. Something is wrong with the lock. Still, I have tricks up my sleeve. I make a Master Key. I'm not supposed to know how to do this, but I've been here a while. This should override any issues with lock encryption or the like.\n\nNope. Not happening. Red light.\n\nIt should be noted that the guest was supremely chill about the whole thing. No fire-tongued Karen here! But she was concerned because she had equipment in there she would need to get out by seven, or her entire week-long business trip would be ruined. For her and her four colleagues.\n\nNo pressure.\n\nOkay, get her into a different room so she can at least sleep and get a shower, while I text the manager. He won't wake up until five, and it will take him two hours to get here, so I'm hoping to reach him. Meanwhile I try to get the lock open. Get out the cleaning cards; a stiff bit of cardboard soaked in isopropyl alcohol. While it removes some crud, it doesn't help. \n\nI finally give up. I have exhausted my bag of tricks. Even magical unicorn sparkles are not enough. I text my manager a few more times in hopes he'll wake up, but to no avail. My last text informs him that due to the time crunch, I will be blowing up his phone at five.\n\nIt should be noted that we are a small hotel, and while we do have a maintenance guy, the manager is the only one who knows the ins and outs of our old outdated locks.\n\nNothing more to be done. I run audit. I file paperwork. Omphaloskepsis. Chill.\n\nFive am rolls around. I start calling the manager. After six calls, I finally get a bleary response. I give a rundown of the situation, what I've tried, and mention that the guest is now awake and while not *nervous* is *concerned*. Plus I need to get Breakfast started.\n\nApparently the lock's aged circuit board has failed. There is no easy way to open it. I am given instructions on how to jimmy the lock, using a crowbar and key card. This doesn't work; while I could get the card into place, the bolt wasn't budging.\n\nThere is a deep sigh from my manager, \"Okay Skwrl, this is me giving you permission to use violence.\"\n\nYay violence!\n\nSo if you ever need to open a locked door, here's how: use a crowbar to pry the door away from the frame, right where the bolt is. Then use a *second* bar to widen and hold the gap. Then *slam* your hip into the - wait, take your cellphone out of your pocket first - *slam* your hip into the door. Preferably while cursing your manager who Is! Not! Here! To! deal with this oh there we go.\n\nGuest is relieved and happy, damage is minimal and mostly cosmetic, room is put out of service, and I have a nice feeling of accomplishment. Mighty! Flex muscles! Grunt! Breakfast is about five minutes late, but all good. \n\nIn any case, that is the story of how your humble narrator got to break down a door this morning. Praise Ganesha. Take some time to say goodbye to Buttercup and have a lovely day.\n\nTeal Deer; bad lock leads to door being forced open.",

    "body": "\nI have hiked 100 different trails on the island of Oahu. I define a “hike” as following any specified route with the intention of appreciating the surrounding environment. So with that definition, I also include things like beach walks or botanical gardens, so long as there’s a specific route I followed.\n\nI tried my best to label difficulty level for the average person. But since difficulty is relative, move it up one (I.e. easy = medium) if you’re only used to easy, flat trails. And move it down one (I.e. hard = medium) if you’re extremely fit with mountaineering experience. \n\nAll that out of the way, here’s some recommendations. Whether you’re visiting Oahu, or if you live here and want to start hiking but don’t  know where to begin, hopefully this post can help you out.\n\n_______________________________\n\nRELAXING FOREST HIKE: Aiea Loop.\n\nPopular loop trail that is entirely shaded, with a couple great overlooks. \n\nEasy, 5 miles, 1258ft of elevation gain, 2-3 hours.\n\n[Aiea Loop pic](https://postimg.cc/47P3Dztb)\n\n\nGOOD HIKE FOR VIEWS OF HONOLULU/WAIKIKI: Wa’ahila Ridge.\n\nDiamond head is the obvious answer, but that feels like a cop-out since it’s the most well-known hike in the state. So I’ll give a different answer: Wa’ahila Ridge. You walk along a ridge that dips in and out of the treeline with several amazing views of Honolulu. Best view is 1.2 miles in, just before the trail ends at the intersection with Kolowalu trail.\n\nMedium, 2.5 miles, 1055ft of elevation gain, 2-3 hours.\n\n[Wa’ahila Ridge pic](https://postimg.cc/rzTng5QZ)\n\n\nBEST BEACH HIKE: Kahuku Shoreline.\n\nBegins at Turtle Bay resort and follows the coastline. Most people turn around at Kahuku Point a mile and a quarter in, but you can go as far as Kahuku Beach Park (which would be 10 miles round trip). Lots of empty stretches of white sand beach.\n\nEasy, 2.5-10 miles, <100ft of elevation gain, 1-5 hours \n\n[Kahuku Shoreline pic](https://postimg.cc/4YpH8H8w)\n\n\nHIKE FOR JUNGLE SCENERY: Mānoa Falls.\n\nLush rainforest with towering trees and ends at a tall waterfall. Films such as Jurassic World, Lost, etc were filmed here.\n\nEasy, 2 miles, 577ft of elevation gain, 1.5-2.5 hours.\n\n[Manoa Falls pic](https://postimg.cc/0rxvmMmP)\n\n\nHIKE FOR VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTS: Kuli’ou’ou Ridge.\n\nStarts in a rainforest, switchbacks up to a ridge full of pine trees. Once you climb higher, it opens up to more native plants. Ends at the summit ridge with a great view.\n\nHard, 4.5 miles, 1666ft of elevation gain, 2-4 hours.\n\n[Kuliouou Ridge pic](https://postimg.cc/Mc8P4RzG)\n\n\nHIKE WITH SWIMMING: Waimano Falls.\n\nDescends into a valley to a stream that ends in a waterfall and pools with water deep enough for cliff diving, and even a rope swing.\n\nHard, 3 miles, 800ft of elevation gain, 2-3 hours.\n\n[Waimano Falls pic](https://postimg.cc/75sXPmCt)\n\n\nHIKE FOR WILDLIFE VIEWING: Ka’ena Point.\n\nFollows the last completely undeveloped coastline on Oahu to a protected sanctuary for seabirds. Depending on the season, you can see Albatross, Monk seals, Turtles, and Whales.\n\nEasy, 5 miles, 250ft of elevation gain, 1.5-2.5 hours.\n[Kaena Point pic](https://postimg.cc/ZBShjbTd)\n\nHIKE FOR HISTORY: Old Pali Road.\n\nFollows a highway built in the 1800’s during pre colonial times and abandoned in the 1950’s. Ends at an overlook which happens to be the site of arguably the most significant battle in Hawaii’s history. \n\nMedium, 4 miles, 2142ft of elevation gain, 1.5-2.5 hours.\n\n[Old Pali Rd pic](https://postimg.cc/6yNMMM4F)\n\n\nBEST HIKE TO SEE PALM TREES: Koko Crater Botanical Garden. \n\nA botanical garden built directly in the center of Koko Crater with almost every variety of palm tree from around the world you can imagine.\n\nVery Easy, 2 miles, <100ft of elevation gain, 1-2 hours.\n\n[Koko Botanic Garden pic](https://postimg.cc/k2MGvdJG)\n\nHIKE FOR A WORKOUT: Koko Crater.\n\nNo better hike for a straight up leg day workout. Climbs an old military tramway like stairs to the summit of Koko Crater. \n\nHard, 1.5 miles, 886ft of elevation gain, 1-2.5 hours.\n\n[Koko Crater pic](https://postimg.cc/TywZ9t5n)\n\nHIKE FOR IF YOU DON’T WANT A WORKOUT: Aihualama Falls/Lyon Arboretum.\n\nAn easy, well-maintained stroll through a historic arboretum that leads to a small waterfall.\n\nVery Easy, 1.2 miles, 357ft of elevation gain, 1-2 hours.\n\n[Aihualama Falls pic](https://postimg.cc/ygS6f13h)\n\n\nFUN HIKE IF YOU’RE SUPER FIT: Mount Olympus.\n\nAn extension of the Wa’ahila Ridge Trail mentioned above, but it goes all the way to the mountain summit. Not super technical, but fatiguing as it follows the “roller coaster” ridgeline.\n\nVery Hard, 5.5 miles, 2165ft of elevation gain, 4-6 hours.\n\n[Mt Olympus pic](https://postimg.cc/sG4Mcjb6)\n\n\nCHALLENGING, ALL DAY MOUNTAIN: Lanihuli via Kapālama Trail.\n\nThis hike climbs to the summit of a prominent, picturesque mountain called Lanihuli. Super fun if you’re into mountaineering and want an adventurous challenge.\n\nVery Hard, 7.5 miles, 2864ft of elevation gain, 6-8 hours.\n\n[Lanihuli pic](https://postimg.cc/JsvdmMdd)\n\n\nHIKE TO CLIMB THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN: Mt Ka’ala Trail.\n\nBegins in a remote valley and forest before ascending very steeply up a ridge to the summit of Mt Ka’ala, the tallest peak on Oahu. At the top is a boardwalk through a high-elevation rainforest with some extremely rare endemic plant species.\n\nVery Hard, 7.5 miles, 3750ft of elevation gain, 5-7 hours.\n\n[Mt Ka’ala pic](https://postimg.cc/m1B5qj6L)\n\n\n\nBEST HIKE FOR SCRAMBLING: Mt Olomana (first peak only)\n\nClimbs the side of a jagged, intimidating mountain. It gets steeper and steeper the higher you climb, with lots of scrambling. It culminates at a 15-foot vertical rock face. Don’t go past the first peak, because the first peak is the tallest and has the best view. The trail past the first peak gets extremely dangerous with deadly consequences if you make any mistakes. \n\nHard, 3.5 miles, 1529ft of elevation gain, 2-4 hours.\n\n[Mt Olomana pic](https://postimg.cc/G82QsfNs)\n\n\n“OFF THE BEATEN PATH” HIKE: Hau’ula Loop.\n\nA scenic loop hike that is rarely ever crowded. Lots of forest, cool plants, and views of the surrounding valleys.\n\nMedium, 2.5 miles, 853ft of elevation gain, 2-3 hours.\n\n[Hau'ula Loop pic](https://postimg.cc/5YLtp4Zc)\n\n\nHIKE FOR ANYONE STAYING AT KO’OLINA/WEST SIDE: Ma’ili Pillboxes.\n\nQuick but steep hike up a high west side ridge, atop which sits several WWII “pillbox” structures.  One is pink for breast cancer awareness.\n\nMedium, 1.5 miles, 613ft of elevation gain, 1.5-2.5 hours.\n\n[Ma'ili Pillbox pic](https://postimg.cc/D8s9xCfX)\n\n\n\nIF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE DAY RESERVED FOR HIKING, BUT WANT TO EXPERIENCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE: Makiki-Tantalus\n\nStarting in Makiki Valley, this loop hike combines 8 different trails into one large loop. It’s sort of like a “grand tour” of the diverse nature on Tantalus, which is a large mountain that looms over Honolulu.\n\nMedium, 8 miles, 2195ft of elevation gain, 4-7 hours.\n\n[Makiki-Tantalus pic](https://postimg.cc/BjjMhbBw)\n\n\nHIKE FOR SERENE HAWAIIAN NATURE: Poamoho Trail.\n\nA remote ridge that takes you through a beautiful forest filled with more native plants than you would see on most other trails. The view at the summit is unparalleled. \n\nMedium, 6.5 miles, 1880ft of elevation gain, 4-6 hours.\n\n[Poamoho pic](https://postimg.cc/gr5wV0r0)\n\n*NOTE ABOUT POAMOHO TRAIL: This trail requires a permit to hike, which can be found [here](https://stateofhawaii.na1.echosign.com/public/esignWidget?wid=CBFCIBAA3AAABLblqZhBUqhfPKWgsO4EwOodHZRp2TTrCTJTPutV4AjVLpDpK-7TWtCj6A6iO6pjCIietWYg*). You will also need a 4-Wheel Drive vehicle to access the trail. This is not optional, as anything without 4WD will get stuck on the very rugged access road.\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\nThose are all of my do’s, but here’s a list of don’ts. I’ll explain why these specific hikes are not worth your time if you’re a visitor to the island.\n\n\nHA’IKU STAIRS/STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN: Obvious reasons. It’s infamously illegal, and is in the process of being removed. People can and do get arrested all the time. They have cops stationed at the entrance 24/7 now. Yes, even the “secret” alternate entrances. \n\nMOANALUA MIDDLE RIDGE: You’ve probably heard about the “legal back way” to the stairway to Heaven. While the ridge itself may be legal, you still have to enter restricted area long before you get anywhere near the stairway. The cops have been known to occasionally fly an officer up to the top to ticket/arrest hikers, regardless of which way they came. On top of that, the ridge has seen insane amounts of traffic in the last decade, causing massive erosion. It’s super hazardous to hikers now because landslides are happening more and more frequently. Not only that, but it’s also damaging to the fragile native plants on the ridge. Please, just don’t do this hike. There’s plenty that are way better.\n\n\nSTAIRWAY TO HELL: This other stairway across the valley from the Ha’iku Stairs is gaining popularity lately. But it’s NOT a good alternative. The reason is solely because of how difficult it is to reach them. It’s about 13 miles round trip over terrain that is endlessly hilly, extremely overgrown with near impenetrable thicket, and along a knife-edge ridge where one slip could mean plummeting 2500 feet to your death. However, this is not to say it should NEVER be hiked. I’ve done it; it’s actually one of my favorites! But it should not be attempted unless you have significant experience on the terrain specific to the Ko’olau mountains. \n\n\nHAHAIONE-PYRAMID ROCK LOOP: Honestly, there’s nothing super terrible about this hike. I only don’t recommend it if you’re visiting as a tourist. Since you have limited time, your energy is best spent on other hikes, as this particular loop is kind of disappointing. No native plants, barely any views (even from the titular pyramid rock), and the route along the top is very confusing to follow. Just not worth your time, in my humble opinion.\n\n\nLIKEKE LOOP TRAIL: If you’re interested in the Likeke Falls trail (which is a great little waterfall hike), you might look on AllTrails and see there’s an extension to it! Seems fun in theory, but in reality the trail is like this: One third is on the Ho’omaluhia Botanical Garden road, on which you will be dodging speeding tourists in their rental luxury cars. One third literally on the side of a freeway. And the other third is nice (which is literally just the Likeke Falls section). Not to mention, I think the route involves trespassing, since you have to climb over a fence. Just stick to Likeke Falls.\n\n\nWAHIAWA HILLS: This hurts to put on the list, because it’s one of my favorite hikes. But itd be irresponsible to recommend it to any visitors or novice hikers. First of all, the route is super confusing. There’s so many junctions in the trail that would make it easy to get very lost in the massive Ewa Forest Reserve. I’ve done the trail nearly a dozen times and still manage to take at least one wrong turn every single time. Secondly, the trail circles around a large stream. If it were to rain unpredictably (which is not uncommon), the stream could flash flood and strand any hikers with no way to get out.\n\n\nCROUCHING LION: You may have heard about this hike due to its interesting name and huge popularity on social media. A lot of people say it’s easy. It’s not easy at all, just short. You have to scramble up a steep and slippery hill, and then the rocky area at the top is narrow, and many hikers have died from falling off. Rescues happen on that trail pretty much every week. Not to mention, it’s illegal, so you would get cited for trespassing if you needed a rescue. Not worth it.\n\n\nDEADMAN’S CATWALK: Another super eye-catching name and lots of social media popularity. But the trail is also illegal, and they often have a cop stationed at the trailhead. Not to mention, they removed the actual “deadman’s catwalk” years ago, so there’s nothing up there to see anymore.\n\n\n_______________________________\n\n\nNow I’m going to talk about the most popular hikes on Oahu, the ones you have probably heard about. These are recommended hike would find in 99% guidebooks. I’m just going to state my personal thoughts on them.\n\n\nDIAMOND HEAD: I actually really like this hike, I’d say it’s worth the hype. Great view from the top and the bunkers are fun to explore. Be that as it may, it feels more like a museum than a hike. Expect it to be extremely crowded with long lines to get past bottlenecks. And not much in the way of nature. Make sure to bring plenty water though and sturdy shoes, though; while it may not “feel” like a hike, it’s still a workout in the sun with little shade.\n\nKOKO CRATER: I already briefly talked about it above. But really it’s just a leg workout. Like Diamond head, not much nature, and often super crowded. The view from the top is good, but in my opinion, not nearly as good as many other hikes on Oahu. \n\nMAKAPU’U LIGHTHOUSE: I’m not personally a fan of this hike, but that’s a matter of my opinion rather than an objective fact. It’s paved the entire way, but still a good amount of elevation gain. No shade to be found anywhere on the trail, and it’s packed most days. The views are great if you like rocky cliffs jutting out of the ocean. Not to mention there’s a good chance of seeing whales in the winter months. \n\nMĀNOA FALLS: Another one I mentioned above. It’s a nice trail with beautiful scenery and a waterfall. It’s also super crowded, so don’t expect it to be a peaceful, serene experience.\n\nLANIKAI PILLBOXES: Social media has skyrocketed this hike’s popularity in the past decade. It’s a short but steep climb to gain the ridgeline, with some WWII pillboxes and a great view. Extremely crowded, mostly by Instagram/TikTok influencers. So if you want to stand on the pillboxes to see the view, you’ll have to wait a long time behind the hordes of people posing on them. \n\n\n_________________________________\n\n\nLAST IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW:\n\n - Before you go on any hike, spray your shoes with isopropyl alcohol. Due to Oahu being an island, it’s especially vulnerable to invasive species. Spraying your shoes can help get rid of any “hitchhikers” you may be carrying.\n\n\n- Hawaii is a tropical environment! It’s hot (duh). Bring lots of water, snacks, and sun protection!\n\n\n- Being such a rainy environment, the trails here become overgrown very quickly. Bring long pants to hike in so you don’t get your legs scratched up by the brush.\n\n\n- Most of the terrain is mud and clay. It’s often really slippery and not easy to get a good grip, especially when scrambling. \n\n\n- The rocks are super crumbly. Be very cautious when scrambling, and test your weight on every hold before committing.\n\n\n- Dogs are required to be on a leash at all times.\n\n\n- Be respectful! Remember, unless you’re Kanaka Maoli by descent, you are a guest on the island!\n\n\n- Have fun!\n\n\nThat’s just about all I have to say. Feel free to ask any questions and I’ll do my best to answer them. For anyone curious, here’s my full list of 100 hikes I’ve done. In order for each hike to count as its own distinct hike, there has to be at least some part of it that is different from another hike. For example, doing the exact same loop hike in opposite directions is still the same one. But combining two trails I’ve done into one longer route still counts as its own new hike. If I only go halfway on an out-and-back hike, I only count it as a separate hike from the full one if there is a specific landmark at the turnaround point that could stand as its own hike. For example, Wa’ahila Ridge and Mount Olympus are 2 different hikes.\n\nI’m also working on making this post into a YouTube video which will go into more detail and show footage of the hikes. If the mods allow it, I’ll update this post with a link when it’s done.\n\nAiea Loop\n\nAihualama Falls/Lyon Arboretum\n\nAla Moana Regional Park Loop\n\nAlan Davis Beach\n\nBowman-Moanalua Bypass via KST \n\nDiamond Head\n\nEhukai Pillboxes\n\nFort Ruger Pathway \n\nHahaione-Pyramid Rock Loop\n\nHanauma Bay Ridge\n\nHau’ula Loop\n\nHawai’i Loa Ridge\n\nIliahi Ridge Loop\n\nJudd Loop Trail\n\nJudd-Seven Bridges Traverse \n\nK1 via Kōnāhuanui Ridge Trail\n\nKa’au Crater \n\nKa’ena Point\n\nKahekili Trail\n\nKahuku Shoreline\n\nKa’iwa Ridge to Wailea Point \n\nKa’iwi Pali Trail \n\nKa’iwi Shoreline \n\nKaka’ako Waterfront Park Loop\n\nKamaile’unu Ridge\n\nKalama-Mau’uwai Loop\n\nKauhao Pali\n\nKawela Bay Trails\n\nKealia Trail\n\nKoko Crater \n\nKoko Crater Arch\n\nKoko Crater Botanical Garden\n\nKoko Crater via Arch/East Rim\n\nKolowalu Trail\n\nKulana’ahane Trail\n\nKulepeamoa-Hawaii Loa Ridge Loop\n\nKuli’ou’ou Ridge\n\nKuli’ou’ou-Hawai’i Loa Ridge via KST\n\nKuli’ou’ou-Pu’u’okona Loop\n\nKuli’ou’ou Valley\n\nLā’ie Falls\n\nLā’ie-Pupukea via KST\n\nLanihuli via Kapalama Ridge\n\nLanikai Pillboxes\n\nLanipō/Mau’umae Ridge\n\nLikeke Falls\n\nLikeke Loop Trail\n\nLua’ala’ea Falls\n\nLulumahu Falls\n\nMa’ili Pillboxes\n\nMakapu’u Lighthouse Trail\n\nMakapu’u Tidepool Loop\n\nMakapu’u-Kuli’ou’ou via KST\n\nMakaua Falls\n\nMakiki Falls\n\nMakiki Valley Loop\n\nMakiki-Tantalus\n\nMānoa Falls\n\nMānoa Falls-K2-Mānoa Middle Loop\n\nMānoa Middle Ridge\n\nMānoa Middle-Olympus Loop\n\nMauna’o’ahi Ridge \n\nMaunawili Ditch Trail\n\nMaunawili Falls via Pali\n\nMau’umae Bench\n\nMt Ka’ala Trail\n\nMt Olomana/Three Peaks\n\nMt Olympus via Wa’ahila Ridge\n\nNu’uanu-Judd Loop\n\nOld Pali Road\n\nOne’awa Hills\n\nPalehua-Palikea\n\nPapali-Poamoho via KST\n\nPoamoho Trail\n\nPupukea Summit Trail\n\nPu’u Hapapa \n\nPu’u Heleakala \n\nPu’u Kalena via Kolekole Pass\n\nPu’u Kaua\n\nPu’u Keahi’akahoe via Moanalua Middle Ridge \n\nPu’u Ma’eli’eli \n\nPu’u Ōhi’a/Tantalus Summit\n\nPu’u Pia\n\nStairway to Hell via Aiea Ridge\n\nTripler Ridge \n\nTripler/End of Road Loop\n\nUalaka’a Loop\n\nUpper Tantalus Loop\n\nWa’ahila Mountain Bike Trail\n\nWa’ahila Ridge\n\nWahiawa Botanical Garden\n\nWahiawa Hills\n\nWahiawa Hills Micro-Loop\n\nWaiakeakua Falls\n\nWaimano Falls\n\nWaimano Tunnels\n\nWaimano Upper/Lower Loop\n\nWaimea Valley/Falls\n\nWiliwilinui Ridge\n\nWiliwilinui-Olympus via KST\n\n",

    "body": "This post is a follow-up to my story from last week [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mgpsn/so_i_broke_an_entire_bottle_of_liquor_into_my/)\n\nFirst, I want to thank the community for the support as soon as I posted the story.  I literally wanted to just throw the whole thing in the trash after it happened as I was sure everything was toast.  Hell, it was going to be an excuse to get a mATX build going finally.  However, you guys gave me tons of help (and a few laughs) which definitely helped.  \n\n[Here](http://imgur.com/a/Vte9Y) are the pictures, wish I would have taken more/better ones but got caught up in the process.  I followed /u/adumbgorilla's advice to remove everything and soak in alcohol.  Ordered 99.9% Isopropyl Alcohol from Amazon after reading his suggestion and waited till Wednesday to start the disassemble process.  I figured waiting wouldn't cause any additional damage and I had to wait for the alcohol to be delivered anyways.  \n\nFast-forward to Wednesday and you can follow along in the pictures.  The alcohol was incredibly sticky and little crystals of rock hard sugar were everywhere.  I removed the Ram, took off the casings and dropped them in the alcohol.  Next, took off the cooler and inspected the CPU.  Luckily there was only a small spot of sugar on the side and it came off easily with the Arctic Silver thermal paste cleaner.  \n\nNext, took off the lower GPU and opened it up.  After removing the exterior casing, it looked like it was extremely clean except for the shell.  Just wiped the shell off and cleaned the ports.  Next, the GPU on top was out and pulled apart.  This thing definitely took the brunt of the assault.  Removed the shell, fan, and heatsink and dropped it in the alcohol.  Removed the hard drives, wiped them down, and set aside. Took the hard drive racks and plopped them in.  At this point, I was down to the PSU and Mobo.  \n\nAt this point, I ran into my biggest problem.  I was running a 2500k and figured my mobo was toast.  It was so soaked, sugar filled every port, that I just saw it as a lost cause.  Furthermore, I was worried about putting a potentially good part into the mobo then frying that part.  So I knew I needed another sandy-bridge compatible mobo but I was really frustrated that I might be buying an old mobo, have a ton of non-working parts, then have an older mobo with no purpose.  At this point, my friend pointed out that he had an extra EVGA P67 SLI board that he wasn't using.  I took it off him (still owe him a lot of beer for that one) and pressed on.  \n\nThe PSU was a really scary one for me.  I get freaked out easily from the thought of electrical fires so really didn't think it was worth chancing cleaning the PSU if it got really messy during the spill.  To my surprise, the PSU was fine, it barely had any spots at all and the fan didn't suck up anything.  The cables were pretty gross but I wiped those down with a rag/alcohol and cleaned the ports with a toothbrush.  Tested that the PSU wasn't blown by doing the paperclip trick.  \n\nThe sugar took forever to breakdown.  I ended up leaving the ram in for 12 hours and the GPU in for a little over 24.  After I was convinced that everything was working, I took the hard drives and the second GPU (the cleanest one) and plugged into my roommates PC.  Everything worked, I was ecstatic.  Really got my hopes up at that point.  I figured best case, I'm out a GPU, worst case, I'm out a CPU/GPU/RAM/possibly a PSU still (didn't test the voltage).  \n\nFast-forward to today. Plugged everything in (except for first GPU) and hit power.  Everything came back up!  I was thrilled.  The crazy thing, I didn't even have to reinstalll Windows, it just came right back up.  I thought that switching out the mobo would make me reinstall but it's like nothing ever happened.  Though now, I'm getting a weird Windows Activation error but I'll just call customer support tomorrow (everything I've researched about this problem is directing me to reinstall Windows, would prefer to avoid that if possible).  \n\nWaiting for the first GPU took dry off before I put the heatsink and fan back on.  Don't have high hopes for this one but if this process has taught me anything, you never know.  \n\n**TL/DR:  Poured a bottle of liqour into my computer while it was on, cleaned it, and everything works** \n\nJust want to say thank you all again for the support! \n",

    "body": "Tales I posted so far were about my work at the Telco I'm currently employed at, or another IT job I had when I was starting out. Yet I've also worked jobs of my own for private parties through they years, as they were very profitable side-gigs. To be honest, I still do some once in a blue moon! My rates nowadays for private work are purposely high; I want to avoid volume, but I have tales worth sharing when it comes to self-employment. \n\nOne Saturday morning a couple years back, my phone rang with an unusual tune. I have several different numbers, each with it's own ringtone, but hadn't heard this one in awhile as I was already phasing-out my former side-gig by then. It was an old customer. \n\n> Old Customer: \"Bytewave? I don't know if you remember me, you somehow salvaged my files from a virus a few years ago, and then earlier from that wipe thing? Look, I tried two local techs, they couldn't do anything. My cellphone was dropped in hot soap water. I could lose everything I have locally on my phone - that will absolutely not do. I know you are done with this line of work, but I'd *really* like you to try. Money is no object, if you can get it done??\" \n\nWell, that was the kind of offer that's hard to turn down.\n\n> Bytewave: \"I still do a little work on the side - but yeah, I'm mostly out of my old business. My rates have gone up quite a bit, but for past customers who can meet them, I'm still there on a extraordinary basis. As I'm not a scam artist, I will say right away... since you need data recovery, you're not talking to the right guy. I can give you 2 or 3 numbers for professional data recovery firms who have tools better than my own to do this. Professional data recovery is pricey, but I don't think this is an issue here?\" \n\nThe lady kept an apartment in NY's Upper East Side as 'just another' residence because she had family there. Obviously if she cared about data on her cell, paying 10-20K'ish to a professional recovery firm was pennies for her. I'm just a guy teaching frontline for a Telco, this wasn't my field of expertise.\n\n> Old Customer: \"But I don't trust them. You helped me out twice, both times when others had failed before... If you want to contract the work to other specialists that's great. I just want you in charge of the process from A to Z - deciding who does what. It's not about money. And please don't do it yourself if someone could potentially do it better, I just need someone knowledgeable to call the right people. I'd rather you didn't if there's any risk. I'll never know who to trust, but you do. Handle it. You'll be paid as many hours as you need at any rate plus their full bill, even if it's ultimately unrecoverable.\" \n\nWell, that kind of offer *makes* a Saturday morning. I silently giggled and yet cheered as I promptly agreed. She was on the other side of Canada and yet barely three hours later *two* couriers were on the ground floor of my condo tower with a box, most of which was filled with rice, and the cellphone was deep in. She since then had forwarded me emails from her first two technicians, both of whom were all about using either rice or distilled water to fix the water damage to her phone.\n\nIf I have to hear about rice or distilled water one more time... **NO** - That's not how you reliably fix water damage! The best homemade solution is high-strength isopropyl alcohol.  \n\nI've salvaged many water-damaged devices by taking them *utterly* apart and using a strong concentration of isopropyl alcohol on every part and then putting it back together. Nothing else absorbs water just as well without damaging hardware. In her case, as per her directions, I'm just an intermediary to professionals in the field. If I had to, I'd use 99% isopropyl, but she's specifically paying me just to overview the process, not to do it myself. I'm pretty sure the guys I'll be calling know far more than I do when it comes to data recovery. Just because I've recovered most other devices I've worked with before with that technique, clearly I'm still nowhere where the techniques specialists use...\n\nData recovery was never my field even tho I can do an acceptable field-attempt. Having easy access to 99% isopropyl is already a good start sometimes. Many others prefer to do with the 91%-variety commonly sold in the US. It's usually almost as good, but in my mind, professional firms ought to have capabilities that far outweigh this.\n\nI call the top recovery firms I know of from personal experience, and explain the problem. Pricey, but the customer will not care. I could name the company I chose, but I'm not offering free publicity. They get to work, and soon later, they call me back.\n\n> Data recovery: \"Yeah, I'm calling with some great news. We've been able to recover everything on your list.\" \n\n> Bytewave: \"Superb. I didn't expect any less from you guys. Can I ask about your recovery technique? You'll be paid the full amount anyhow, but I'm very curious professionally.\"  \n\n> Data Recovery: \"Each component was carefully taken apart by our expert technicians and dipped into high-concentration 91% isopropyl alcohol, ensuring that...\" \n\n...\n\n**OH HELL**, you've got to be kidding me! Despite my premium rates and my ability to easily score better concentrations than these guys had, I ended up getting a smaller cut of the final bill for a technique I could have qualitatively bested if I had done it on my own, with what I already had access to. Contracting it onwards to the 'experts' thinking they'd do something I couldn't was utterly useless. Yet it's still hard to complain, as my final bill for this job was by far the best per-hour I ever had. Still it taught me a lesson. It's great to contract down, but never do it unless you are certain it's in your financial interest!\n\n*facepalms*\n\n[All of Bytewave's Tales on TFTS!](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/search?q=author%3ABytewave&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) ",

    "body": "Hey guys. This past year I have done extensive research on hair care. I have researched hair growth tips, I have bought so many things to assist with my hair, and, I have bought so many shampoos and conditioners. I wanted to share everything I’ve learned, as well as what seems to work best. My hair grows very quickly and it’s incredibly healthy with these tips. \n\nTip 1: it does not matter how often you wash your hair. Hairstylist, beauty influencers, and hair influencers love to say that you should NOT wash your hair daily. However, you definitely can. I actually wash my hair daily. It significantly depends on your hair type. If you have dry hair, don’t wash so often. If you have oily hair, feel free to wash daily. Daily hair washing has not affected my hair. \n\nTip 2: Natural shampoo and conditioner, drug store shampoo and conditioner, and salon shampoo and conditioner will most likely not yield different results. Again, this depends on your hair type. However, from my experiments, the quality of the shampoo and conditioner made no difference. All shampoos strip your hair of oil (regardless of if they’re sulfate free or not) and conditioner essentially re-moisturizes your hair. Salon quality and drug store products usually are similar in terms of ingredients. Salon products tend to have drying ingredients too (like glycols, isopropyl alcohol, and sulfates.) therefore, just use what you find best for your hair!\n\nTip 3: sulfates and silicones are not the devil. These ingredients are in hair care because they have been researched and they are effective. Sulfates will not make your hair fall out. They cleanse and most people do not get irritated from sulfates. Silicones do provide a barrier, and are often that slippery feeling in conditioner. Silicones seal moisture in, so it is hard for moisture to leave and enter your hair. However, silicones are usually beneficial in humid weather.\n\nTHE BEST WAY TO GROW YOUR HAIR IS WITH THE FOLLOWING TIPS:\n\nMy number one tip is to MASSAGE YOUR SCALP DAILY. This is definitely the way to having fast hair growth!\n\nIf your hair gets oily easily, you can use a scalp massager. They are about $5-10 dollars on amazon, and that way, you aren’t using your oily fingers. \n\nA good way to massage your scalp is through Ayurvedic pressure points. The pressure points are 8 fingers above your eyebrows, 12 fingers above your eyebrows, and 4 above the nape of your neck. \n\nMy SECOND TIP is to oil your scalp once-twice a week! The best oils for growth are Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, Argan oil, avocado oil, olive oil, etc. Just like your face needs skin care, your scalp needs care too. \n\nAyurvedic herbs are also great for hair, like Amla and Brahmi\n\nAdditionally, rosemary is amazing for your hair. \n\nMY THIRD TIP is to follow a capillary schedule. This is Portuguese, and it basically is a weekly schedule of your hairs needs. For example, some days you need hydration, others you need nutrition, and lastly, reconstruction. These were usually masks and provide your hair with what it needs. \n\nLASTLY, never sleep with your hair wet!! Always make sure it is dry first. Put it in a protective style, like a braid, or low bun. Never sleep with it just hanging loose. This is a HUGE contribution to damage and is a VERY important tip.\n\nAnother thing you can do is add coffee to your shampoo. Caffeine improves circulation to your scalp and aids growth. \n\nThese are the tips I’ve learned to be very beneficial. I know this is long, but I really hope this helps some people with their growth journey.",

        "body": "My wife has the most beautiful hair I've ever seen. It's literally her glory. She's a 41F natural brownish blonde. She developed thicker hair with natural curls after having our first and only child. She has taken great care of it and it looks absolutely amazing. I wouldn't be here to comment if i wasn't absolutely serious about how much i love it. I was actually searching for ways to grow thinning hair in men and came across this thread. I've paid close attention to how she manages it in an effort to restore my hairline to a better place. Here's what I've noticed she does.\n\nShe washes her hair with a specific kind of shampoo and conditioner. It's the purple not your mother's blonde moment shampoo. And the conditioner is an extremely thick lotion like substance called Shea moisture curl & shine conditioner. Purple shampoos work wonders for blonde hair.\n\nShe washes it about every other day, but showers every day.\n\nShe never fully dries her hair with the hair dryer and uses a low heat approach. \n\nShe occasionally straitens her hair but i keep encouraging her to keep her light natural curls because they are so pretty. I think any heat is destructive personally.\n\nSo the technique she uses is she washes her hair first thing in the shower. Rinse well. Then she immediately puts the conditioner in liberally, lots of it. She lets the conditioner soak into her hair while she washes and shaves and takes her time cleaning herself. At the end of the shower she rinses the conditioner out but makes sure to leave a little bit in the hair, not fully rinsing it all out. She then continues to rinse her body because it's like a lotion. This also moisturizes her skin. She typically waits about 20 to 30 minutes before blow drying her hair to about half dry, never fully dry. She lets the rest then dry on its own. \n\nI felt the need to share this information because i love sharing knowledge and somebody might benefit from it. This routine has taken her hair to a much higher level than it ever was before. \n\nAnother additive I've found very nice and useful is Argan Oil of Morroco. That stuff is silky smooth and amazing. I love it, she loves it. It adds the most beautiful shine and it doesn't feel heavy.",

        "body": "i will add my 2 cent to this because my hair has never been better and i have been growing it out for the longest time but only started seeing changes this year. \n\n1. I keep my hair in a bun with a silk scrunchie when i sleep. I do want to buy a silken sleep hat since like that i can avoid any even more friction.\n\n2. I wash my fine, wavy hair with Redken shampoo and conditioner (it the pink bottle). I then apply a leave-in conditioner on my wet hair. I will use olaplex tip oil when it is dry. I simple work a very small amount into my hair in the morning and if the ends look dry also in the evening. \n\n3. I don’t use a lot of heat styling but when i do i use my heat brush. I always use redken blowout cream for heat protection! I usually wait for my hair to be almost dry and then style it just at the end. I get a nice finish and don’t over heat my hair.\n\n4. I try to avoid using hair ties as much as possible. I do a lot of sport so i do either have a big hair clip that keeps my hair together or again my silken scrunchie. \n\n5. I go to the hair dresser twice a year and get my ends trimmed with what is a called a calligraphy cut. Basically it is supposed to promote healthy ends for people whose fine hair is prone to breaking.\n\nI think that should be it. I will definitely try the scalp massage, it makes a lot of sense to me! I yielded very good results. Again my hair type is fine and weavy :)\n\nHope that helps!",

        "body": "After the birth of my first child at 25 when my hair was very long, healthy and I actually did “hair modeling”, my hair fell out from the root and began breaking off all over my head.  I was devastated.  It took me 10 years to get my hair to return growing well and looking good again.  \n\nBut here I am, 65 years old now and have had thick long hair for a long, long time now.  \n\nCurrently my hair is right at the top of my ‘crack’!  Myself and my husband love it.  I have been diligent about not causing breakage to my hair over the years. I have shard my tips for about 30 yrs. and thought I would do so again here.  All of these tips are true actual things I do to my hair and I also assist several other women in growing their hair too because it can be time consuming and difficult.  It takes a team.  My granddaughter’s friends think I’m the bomb because my hair is still thick and very healthy!  So I also teach them along the way.  But I work at it daily. Again, this is what works for me. I hope it helps you too. \n\nHere are my tips/tricks:\n\n1.  A SILK pillow case is a must.  \n\n2.  Lightly pin your hair up on top of your head at night while you sleep.  Not too tight.  A loose bun, up high.  Keep your hair in a loose bun as often as you possibly can, day and night.  Always in wind.  I do so at least 3 days a week and EVERY NIGHT. Stay out of the ocean and swimming pools. \n\n3.  Only wash your hair when it is really dirty.  If you wash daily you are stimulating the oil glands making your hair get dirtier quicker.  It will take awhile to get used to this.  Trust me, this is true. Your scalp will adjust in time. Swear. \n\n4.  Only Sulfate free shampoo and very gentle coloring.  I use Shea Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner and L’Oréal Sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  I love the L’Oréal brand, I always leave a bit of conditioner in my hair from my shoulders to the ends.  Just a bit.   AND never rough your scalp up with your towel, BE GENTLE, SUPER GENTLE. (READ BELOW ABOUT THE COMBING OUT PROCESS) \n\n5.  Do not cut your hair monthly or even every other month.  Let it grow.  Figure out styles that work during the grow out and goofy looking time. \n\n5. Tell your stylist how much to take off your hair; do not let her dictate how much to take off.  They will ALWAYS cut too much without precise direction.  \n\nI usually only have my hair colored, I am totally grey, but I like to keep it colored. I color every 3 months and cut only 1.5 x per year usually 2-3” every 9-10 months.  That’s just what works for me.   \n\n*******BE SURE YOUR STYLIST COMBS YOUR HAIR OUT GENTLY WITH A PICK COMB.  Have her apply a detangler.  They don’t want to, they want to complete the comb out quickly. I used to take my own pick comb and tell her I preferred to comb it out myself.  And I did, and I do.  They will come to respect you for your dedication to the care of your hair. Believe me on this.  I now have an awesome stylist who supports all my efforts, but it took over a year to help her understand how serious I am about hair care. \n\n6.  After shampooing, *****GENTLY comb out your hair with a large pic.  If needed use a detaingling “hand applied hair oil”.  Rub 3-5 drops between your hands, heat it up by vigorous rubbing of your hands, and apply from the ends up.  Then begin combing, ****ALWAYS start from the bottom with a 2” section.  ***Go slow; never rip through your hair.  ****When you stretch your hair, you damage your hair. \n\n7.  At the beginning of trying to get your hair healthy and to help begin the growing process do this: YES, ITS GROSS!! \n\nMix a brand name mayonnaise, a generous amount, and 3 egg yolks (pure protein) in a bowl, whip it with a fork.  Put a towel around your shoulders and apply it generously to your hair.   I lean over the kitchen sink when I do this.  Apply Very generously. \n\nPin it up on top of your head and leave it on for as long as possible.  Stay in a cool environment and be sure it doesn’t get all over your face.  I OFTEN, let it stiffen up and sleep on it for a night.  Yep, sleep on it.  Put a towel on your pillow.  I have been doing this 30+ years.   My husband loves long hair and he supports everything I have to do to keep it looking good to GREAT!! \n\nI even have had girlfriends over for Mimosas and done this together.  They do go home to wash out.  But we sit together 3-4 hours and talk while moisturizing.  THIS WILL REVOLUTIONIZE THE CONDITION OF YOUR HAIR.  But it takes several ( like 4-8 applications).  I always do this even when my hair looks great!  \n\nStart at once a week for a month, then once a month for 6 months, then every 3-4 months.  \n\nWash it out with a sulfate free shampoo and use conditioner after.  It may take more than 1 washing to get it all out.  Wash, let air dry, wash again AND condition again and let air dry.  \n\nIf you do this on a Friday night, you will have it all out by Sunday night. IT IS PURE PROTEIN!  Best thing for your hair. No need for expensive products. \n\n8.  I rarely blow dry, I do blow brush sometimes.  I prefer to let my hair air dry half way, then pin it up in a loose bun for a very airy beachy wave that looks natural.  I still use the old pink rollers on the bottom 6-8” if I want a big curl, and also sometimes use Velcro rollers. \n\nPINK ROLLER TIP:  \n\nUse the largest pink roller.  Remove the foam part and then put a medium size foam roller in its place on the LARGE plastic rolling part.  This will give you more room fr your hair on the curler.   I often sleep in these curlers at the height of about 1” below my shoulders.  I don’t even know they are there these days.  Silk pillow case of course! \n\nI have loads of other tips. If you have any questions, please just ask.  💕🙏🏻💕",

I think the universe sent me to your post at exactly the right time. \n\nI have bipolar depression,  and have been through a sea of meds out there with no success. Finally,  4 years ago,  they put me on depakote. The wild mood swings are controlled now. So I really need this med. But it has caused devastating hair loss. \n\nI'm 53. All my life i have had really thick hair. Like,  can't get the pony holder to go around it twice,  thick. I did notice it thinning as i aged,  but didn't really pay attention because it was still good. Then this med. It became fragile and broken,  falling out and not growing back. It looked a mess,  so i thought,  maybe if i just shave it all off it will look better growing back. I kept it shaved for over a year. I have many chronic illnesses and not having to deal with hair was a relief. But i was missing it,  and started growing it back. I was shocked. I can see my scalp. Like,  all over. It's about shoulder length now. \n\nI have tried to be so careful with it. No heat styling, no chemical processes (pretty much 100% gray), and trying different hair masks. It just keeps falling out. My psychiatrist recommended a hair/ skin/ nails supplement, along with folic acid. Did not work. To the point of being ready to stop the med. But I'm going to try some of the things that worked for you. Can't hurt!  You have inspired me and given me new hope. \n\nI thank you so much for sharing your experience. I will come back in a few months with a report. I've already ordered some of the stuff. And congrats,  your hair is gorgeous!",

After a few reboots I was getting a blank screen on boot.

I set the whole thing on a foil-lined baking tin and baked it for 8 minutes.\n\nLet it cool down, applied fresh thermal paste, put it together. It works perfectly.

        "body": "Grats on the successful reflow. Hopefully, you get some decent life out of the card going forward, but expect to need to replace it sooner than later.\n\nGiven the described issues and subsequent results, I would say it is very likely you had a minor fault in some of the [BGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array) [solder connections](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/W_Rl79ZT9h4eVRrxhz8ASM3j8lKwieXX_SnOZua96BLDkFI69NzCTYz73ez_qPCmYRTcnGFfYRP_vg7bhcVW4GvXGLGhTg) on the primary [GPU chip](https://laptopmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/GeForce_GTX_780m_3qtr.jpg). This is usually a result of thermal stress combined with lead free solder. Basically, the solder gets very hold and \"warps\" slightly, then cools down quickly and \"contracts\" slightly, eventually leading the the [alloy cracking](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pradeep_Lall/publication/276278504/figure/fig5/AS:391809894240262@1470426166603/Solder-joint-progressive-crack-17-mm-BGA-V1.png) and [separating](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cxN-mB0u7GE/maxresdefault.jpg). The solder points might actually still be touching, but without the metal being solid the expansion and contraction can cause the connection to be unreliable and even too weak to function without fault.\n\nThink of it like damaged power cable. Inside the power cable you might have a hundred copper wires all spun together to make one solid cable. If you bend that cable back and forth some of those wires might break. So you might still get power through the cable if there are only a handful of copper wires left connected, but it would be like using a power cable that is much, much thinner. You have essentially just mashed those wires back together and twisted them up a bit. They might be making a good enough connection, but as soon as the cable starts getting bent like it was before, those connections are going to break again.\n\nWithout solving the problem of lead free solder and thermal stress, it isn't likely to be a permanent fix. Basically, you treated the symptom but not the cause.",

Price-wise it's about the same as what you’d pay on the second-hand market here, but I figured I’d give AliExpress a shot since I’d seen a few decent reviews.\n\nTo my surprise, the unit looks amazing. Both the front display and backplate were replaced, and they really did a great job. No scratches or wear at all. It genuinely looks new at first glance.\n\nThat said, some of the smaller crevices were a bit grimy. A quick scrub with a toothbrush and some isopropyl alcohol cleaned it right up though, so nothing major.\n\nOne unexpected bonus: the Vita came pre-jailbroken. No setup hassle at all. I’m currently playing through Persona 4 Golden and honestly loving the whole experience. First time really diving into the Vita’s library and it’s been worth it so far.\n\nOverall, pretty happy with this purchase.",

Bless, DH. Bless. *Bleeeessssssss.*\n\nYeah, I've gone a bit Southern Pissed. I think I've adapted well to the region. But I'm pissed. Which is why I'm word vomiting all over the internet right now. Coherence is not my friend. \n\nBless.\n\nSee, DH has been fighting some back pain, which has landed him in physical therapy, so I'm blaming that for this lapse of judgement. He agreed to let the ILS talk to the children on the phone, the next time he's home.\n\nWithout talking to me about it. \n\nJust. Agreed.\n\nThey used his moment of legitimate weakness against him.\n\nYep, this is happening.\n\nFUCK!!!\n\nOkay, so DH, bless him all over the fucking place, is nothing, if not capable of holding to his word. He agreed. So it will happen. I love and hate him for this trait. Stop being so damned honorable, and just be a dickhead sometimes dammit! And for fucks sake, don't surprise me with it just hours before! \n\nYeah, I wanted to set him on fire. \n\nEnter: Scary Calm Saigh, with Rules.\n\n\"Fine. But they *will* be on speaker. We *will* be present. ACR *will* be on. The first sign of shenanigans, I *will* shut it down, and I *will* be very creative about it. I refuse to budge on this even a little.\"\n\nThankfully, DH agreed, after apologizing profusely with words, wine, foot rubs, and doing the dishes. \n\nThe kids reaction to being told their grandparents would like to speak to them? \"Whatever. Let's get it over with.\" So we call, from his phone, because she doesn't need to know she actually does have my number. Story for a later time.\n\nSon goes first, and after they gush about missing him, to which he just kind of grunts and makes vague noises, he begins a 20 minute monologue about Minecraft. They interrupt to tell him how proud they are of \"their little boy\" and...\"I'm 10. I'm not little anymore. I'm Mom's big boy now.\" They splutter and he dives into some screed I can't even follow about the similarities of red stone circuits and the internal workings of robotics. How Minecraft has helped him in his engineering classes, and oh his science experiment involves the dissolution rates of gummy worms and varying liquids and did you know isopropyl alcohol has a ph of around 5.5?\n\nSTEM kids yo.\n\nHe apparently has a natural talent for grey rocking people into giving up. Who knew?\n\nThey go back to talking to DH, and I should mention that SweetPea was never once brought up in any way, shape, or form. She is more than officially no longer the GC, she is not the Forgotten Child either. She simply doesn't exist. Every attempt by DH to bring her up was shut down, redirected, or flat out ignored. \n\nWe collectively give DH the, \"I fucking told you so.\" look of death. He gives us the last of his jerky.\n\nThey then ask to speak to YD. \n\nIt started off well, but I had a gut feeling it wouldn't last. They've been trying for years to convince this child in particular, to move up to the Frozen Wastes with them. No actual reason, just because. Like we'll just randomly turn over one of our children, especially one they only rarely refer to by name. \n\nExcuse me while I cackle like a loon. \n\nSoooo...Things are going okayish, kid is also doing the Grey Rock Rumba, until I pick up the words \"guilt trip.\" The full sentence was, \"Grandma, I don't need a guilt trip. I'm not moving in with you.\"\n\nEXCUSE ME!?!\n\nI just look at DH, he shrugs and nods, and gives me the after you arm sweep and bow. I grin like the Grinch, settle down next to YD, and hit play. \n\n-----\n\nA NOTE! We are a music obsessed family. We can't play any instruments, but we sing. All of us, with the exception of Son, have been in show choir at some point, and have the awards to prove it. We sing. Sometimes we sing while talking to each other. Sometimes we sing to our food. The point is, we sing. Not always well, but when we need it, we're on point. \n\nWe're also a HamilFam. We've found it has the amazing capacity to bring us out of any foul mood, so long as we stay away from Act 2. After YD introduced us to our eternal ear worms, we've learned every part, and have our \"roles.\" YD is Hamilton/Lafayette. SweetPea is Eliza/Angelica. Son is Laurens. DH is Mulligan/Washington. And me? I'm the damned fool that shot him.\n\n-----\n\nPlay: *\"How does a rag tag volunteer army in need of a shower, somehow defeat a global superpower?\"*\n\nVV - \"What is that noise?\"\n\nMe: *How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire? Leave the battle field waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?*\n\nVV - \"Stop it! You're being rude! We are trying to have a conversation.\"\n\nMe: *Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon.*\n\nVV - \"Are you threatening me!?!\"\n\nMe: *An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in.*\n\nVV - \"Why are you exposing her to that!?!\"\n\nMe: *He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen.*\n\nVV - \"We're in America!\"\n\nMe: *Everyone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!*\n\nVV - \"Stop it! I'm warning you!\"\n\nAll of us: **LAFAYETTE!**\n\nYD: *I'm takin' this horse by the reigns, making Redcoats redder with bloodstains!*\n\nVV now shrieking - \"I SAID STOP IT!!!\"\n\nAll: **LAFAYETTE!**\n\nYD: *And I'm never gonna stop until I make 'em drop and burn 'em up and scatter their remain! I'm..*\n\nAll: **LAFAYETTE!**\n\nVV - Just screams incoherently and hangs up.\n\nI then hit pause, and start laughing. \n\nSon - \"I guess she hates America.\"\n\nWe have a good laugh, and finish Act 1. Which is why I now hold the belief that Hamilton fixes everything. May all the Gods bless Lin-Manuel Miranda.",

It started stuttering all of a sudden. GPU usage went to ~50%. I thought must be CPU bottleneck, so I kept playing. It did not fix itself. Then it crashed.\n\nI tried running some benchmarks... GPU would crash the system (black screen) any time I tried to do something 3D.\nReinstalled the drivers after DDU. Checked windows integrity, sfc /scannow, DISM etc\nLoaded up diagnostics, and saw the GPU's 12V rail was idling at 10V!\n\nThermal of connector at 100C:\nhttps://imgur.com/yK2kRyN <-- The 4 wires are the sense pins. You can see the connector is 100% fully inserted correctly by examining the line behind the \"100.6 C\" text - that top part is the GPU, that bottom part is the connector. They are fully mated. This is hard proof that this is *NOT* user error.\n\nIllustrated picture:\nhttps://imgur.com/akLISAw\nComparison to connector:\nhttps://imgur.com/OEtZGh6\n\nBurned connector:\nhttps://imgur.com/3lE1OWn\nhttps://imgur.com/v8m2N9d\n\nThe GPU pins were covered in melted plastic and carbon. The crevices themselves were chock-full of melted plastic and debris. Took a couple of hours to clean it with isopropyl alcohol and a safety pin.\n\nI had an after-market cable lying around.\n\nThese are the new thermals:\nhttps://imgur.com/Zrar2aG\nhttps://imgur.com/JLBQQpV\n\nQuite an improvement, I would say.\n\n----------------\n\nTheory:\n\nYou can see 4 power pins are melted from insanely bad to not too bad. \n\nI think what happened is, the outside pin had the lowest resistance, and took the most power, hence cooking over a long time. After this finished melting, the burned plastic / carbon caused high resistance due to the pins being coated with gunk. Power was then pulled via a new pin. \n\nAll 4 pins eventually failed, till tonight the card was starved of power and started showing symptoms tonight.\n\nI'm just glad the GPU is OK. \n\nnVidia this is a lawsuit waiting to happen when it burns someone's house down and kills their family.

My mother was a librarian, I grew up around books (my parents owned ~6-7k), and maintain my own personal library. I am less concerned with books lasting generations but maintaining functionality. \n\n*Buying Used*\n\n* Inspect for insect damage or mold. I've seen books sold with book lice, bed bugs, and even ticks.\n\n*Foxing is the light brown spots you see on older books. This is due to oxidation and is harmless*\n\n* Clean the book. You can clean covers with soapy water. I apply to the washcloth/paper towel rather than the book directly. Make sure it's completely dry. \n\n* Stickers can be removed with goo-be-gone, which is a mixture of oil and soap. Make sure to clean with soapy water afterwards so no oil residue remains. Make sure it's completely dry. ETA (from comments): Another option is heptane, which won't leave a residue but can dissolve some dyes and plastics.\n\n* Sanitize with 70-90% isopropyl alcohol. \n\n* If books become infected with mold or insects, they can be frozen. Alternatively mold and smells can sometimes be sanitized by sunlight. Make sure it's completely thawed/dried, bug/mold free, and quarantined before before adding it back to a library. \n\n* Quarantine your books for 4 weeks before adding to your collection. Sometimes secondhand sellers will spray books to remove noxious odors, mold, etc without killing them. Quarantine allows you to find them before they become an issue. \n\n*Storage*\n\n* Store vertically with like-sized books. Books are not constructed to be stored horiztonlly or with uneven side to side pressure. This will damage the spine and significantly decrease the lifespan. \n\n*There are exceptions to this, primarily coffee table books which are usually constructed to be read on a surface and stored flat*\n\n* Consider back-justification. If your spines have started to slant, back justification helps support a straight spine. This can decrease circulation so isn't an option for everyone. \n\n* Do not overfill. Double stacking and overfilling shelves completely increases mold and pest risk by reducing circulation. Trying to squeeze in an extra book can also do damage. \n\n* Aquire bookcases before buying books. Books take a lot of space. For calculating needed bookshelves I use 1 book/inch (unless you are looking at children's books) and 1 shelf per foot (unless you are working with mass markets). A collection of 6500 books takes 540 linear feet or 36 billy bookcases.\n\n* Use book ends. These are cheap/trivial to make. \n\n* If you want to display books, I recommend getting book easels, which will decrease the damage to the spine and cover. These books should be switched out periodically. \n\n* Keep away from light. Do not store directly across from a window. This will, over time, do damage to the books. \n\n* Build in or secure bookcases to studs. \n\n* Consider doors. Dust is sticky and once dust has started to collect on a book it can become difficult to remove. Storing behind doors decreases the accumulation and work to maintain. Another consideration is that doors can be latched, child and earthquake proofing the bookcases. \n\n* Consider silica packets, especially if stored behind glass/doors or in humid environments. These are relatively cheap and you can reuse ones from other purchases. If you live in a place slowly being overtaken by mold, consider a dehumidifier. \n\n* Insect prevention: I fumigate with de (food grade) and put de traps throughout my bookcases to quickly see any infestation (thankfully none). Carpet beetle, silverfish, stink bugs, book lices, moths, and termites will damage books. Cockroaches are attached to dirty/soiled books. \n\n*Maintaince*\n\n* Dust more often than you want to. \n\n* Check for insects and mold. \n\n* Check for bowing or bending shelves, redistribute books or reinforce shelves. \n\n* Clean and quarantine any damaged or soiled books before reshelving them. \n\nRepair\n\n* Consider preventive rather than reactive measures like reinforcing spines, using or installing metal corners, using book covers, etc. \n\n* Patch with book tape, not duct tape. \n\n* Repair Guides\n\nDartmourh Repair Manual\n\nhttps://www.dartmouth.edu/library/preservation/repair/?mswitch-redir=classic\n\nALA Book Repair\n\nhttps://alastore.ala.org/content/book-repair-second-edition-how-do-it-manual-second-edition-revised\n\nSimple Book Repair Techniques \n\nhttps://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538167441/Simple-Book-Repair-Techniques\n\nBookbinding, a step by step guide\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9301878-bookbinding\n\nSaveyourbooks is a company offering free and paid courses as well as supplies in book conservation and restoration\n\nhttps://saveyourbooks.com/\n\n*Insurance*\n\n* Make sure you have pictures and/or catalogue of your library. You can buy a barcode scanner for 30$ and it can be used with multiple paid, free, and open source library tracking apps. Backup these documents in cases of emergency. Book collections are incredibly expensive, even if you aren't purchasing \"fancy\" books. \n\n* A large book collection may need an additional rider. \n\nEdit: I have posted the following (and will update it with further advice) to the book Megathread. I thought this topic was sufficiently different to warrant it's own thread. ",

Our job was to reprint and bind the contents of the smuggled accordian texts into new archival copies of Western style books and donate them to libraries around the world so that Tibetan culture could not be erased. It was great work. I didn't think I might need to do it in my lifetime in my own culture but I'm glad I know how.",

    "body": "GALACTIC YEAR 13.814382120_137\n\nThe human rubbed the toxic solvent all over it's grasping appendage, waving it's hands to let it evaporate. It then outstretched the appendage.\n\nAccording to the diplomatic reports, this was supposed to be a friendly greeting, and Slack could see that, were it not a human performing the gesture.\n\nAfter all Slack had experienced, the reports he had seen, the carnage he had witnessed directly, it wasn't friendly at all.\n\nIt was a threat.\n\nBrazen and callus.\n\nSlack glanced at the solvent dispenser, his cranial implant translating the text on the side: *Isopropyl Alcohol, 70%*\n\nThe human might as well have slathered its hands in molten steel. Slack hesitated for a few moments more, waiting for the solvent to evaporate completely, before extending a tentacle to grip the humans' outstretched appendage. It gripped his tentacle with a hard, rigid strength belying its hardy endoskeleton.\n\nSlack almost shrieked in fear when he felt the smooth, seamless plastic coating on his tentacle slip as he went to withdraw his tentacle before the human had released it's grip.\n\nRough, microscopic ridges on it's appendages seemed to grant it an unusual grip, not unlike Slacks own suckers, though the humans ridges weren't prehensile.\n\nIt began to speak, but Slack couldn't focus on what was being said. He could only imagine the waves of microbes being carried into the surrounding chamber by it's breath.\n\nHe would have to have this room vaporized and reconstructed later. He used his cranial implant to silently mark the room for quarantine.\n\nHe knew he was hallucinating, but he could almost feel the microbes wriggling across his tentacle through the plastic coating where the human had gripped it. He could almost feel the virophages and spores impacting his face.\n\nIt was too much.\n\nGALACTIC YEAR 13.814382117_137\n\nCommander Slack's dreams of fighting space battles against pirates and rescuing enormous females were dashed 180 cycles ago, when he was stationed on this backwater outpost. Barely an observations site, they were 40 LY, an entire day's travel, from the nearest Federation city.\n\nThe only thing he battled these days was boredom.\n\nHe was merely the political Attaché, and his rank was little more than symbolic, but he had imagined things differently. The station itself was so undermanned that he was required to fill many roles outside of his original mode of service. At one time, during the scheduled leave of the maintenance staff, he had even been required to perform several shifts of custodial duty.\n\nFinally, though, something was happening. They had received a report of pirate activity. He was so excited his chromatophores were barely under his control, flickering and slightly off-shade.\n\nThey arrived at the ship emitting the distress beacon. It bore the markings of a well known Pirate fleet. They were famous for preying upon non-Federation vessels, given that they weren't yet entitled to protections of the Federal Fleet. Of course, the Fleet would always help them when they could, but their trade routes wouldn't receive official patrols and outposts until they joined.\n\nIt was strange enough to hear a distress beacon from a pirate ship. Clearly something terrible had happened.\n\nThey were towing a large metal net full of scrap. A quick scanned revealed it to be the remains of a ship that had been forcefully dismantled, likely to be sold as scrap metal. Digital reconstruction showed the technology to be relatively primitive. The engines would definitely earn them entry into the Federation, but everything else was laughably antiquated. Kinetic weapons. No shielding of any kind, not even from particulate matter during FTL travel, a regenerative memory alloy hull that was thick enough to soak up the frequent impacts with dust and debris without a breach. Otherwise, it was soft. Ionization showed that it was no match for the Energy Pulse arrays of the derelict pirate vessel.\n\nThey hailed the pirates, thinking that maybe the new species had commandeered the vessel and were hoping to report the assault and petition for salvage rights with the appropriate authorities. That was a fairly common practice.\n\nAnother scan, this time filtering for life-signs. Nothing.\n\nIt was fully abandoned. Or so they thought.\n\nThe vessel still had life support, though, so they dispatched a normal away team to survey the situation. Within a matter of seconds they lost contact with the crew. The only feedback they received before the entire team went dark was in their vital monitors. Sudden increase in body temperature and heart rate, massive drop in blood pressure.\n\nThe second survey was done with drones.\n\nNo amount of training or experience could prepare Slack for what he saw. The images were classified after the incident, but it would be passed around as a test of courage in academies and Fleet outposts throughout the Federation.\n\nTheir flesh was decayed, but not through rot. It was like they had been dissolved. Slack's friend, another Cephalopod, had been reduced to his beak resting in a puddle of rainbow streaked goo. All of the others had suffered similar fates.\n\nOne of the hardier species, a Mammalian, was able to survive initial exposure better than the others, but not by much. Her flesh was swollen and stretched taught, her normally dense, body-wide fur now spread out far enough to reveal it's shining, red hued skin underneath. That skin was mottled, the normal dark grey interspersed by raised splotches of green and yellow. Her bloodshot eyes oozed red and black pus from the pupils.\n\nShe moved, barely, groaning in pain. She couldn't have heard or seen it. Her eyes were ruined and unmoving, and her ears had swollen shut. She rasped a breath, wheezing and moist.\n\nA scan revealed that her body was undergoing an extreme reaction to a biological agent.\n\n*Whatever the new species was, it must have deployed some kind of biological weapon before being destroyed.*\n\nA heinous crime in civilized society. Pirates or not, this was unforgivable.\n\nThe onboard Physician was able to consult, and thanks to the sophistication of the drones sensors, was able to come up with a diagnosis. Whatever this bioweapon was, it was far to virulent and aggressive to treat. His only prescription was severe sedation while the microbes completed their gruesome work. Being the physician, he also ordered that the ship and drones be vaporized, but only after conducting thorough scans of the microbes in question so that the Federation could work on countermeasures, lest they fall victim to these creatures as well.\n\nThe only problem was that it wasn't just one microbe. There were over 1,000.\n\nOver 1,000 species of virus, fungi, bacteria and archaea had spread throughout the ship. \n\nThis was well above Slack's pay grade, and he had to message HQ to find out what else should be done. The entire time, a strange macabre sense of curiosity drove him to explore the derelict pirate vessel with a drone, surveying the putrid annihilation left behind by this mysterious new species.\n\nThe orders finally came down. They were to print and deploy new drones, equipped with all of the technology required to combat new biological weapons.\n\nIn the mean time, they were to tow the vessel into deep space, and keep close watch over it. They deployed Quarantine beacons every LY in a 10 LY radius around the vessel, and established a 6 ship blockade 1 LY past that radius. Few ships passed through this region of space, but Slack believed these measures to be more than justified.\n\nAfter a few days, full sequencing and analysis was complete. Slack was the only person on the station who was allowed to view any of the results, as they had been classified before they even started the analysis. Even then, his access was highly restricted, only being able to read a heavily redacted version of the document.\n\n*1,049 unique species from 19 unique phyla detected*\n\n*709 Bacterial, 79 Archaeal, 91 fungal and 170 viral species*\n\n*No signs of genetic alteration in any detected species*\n\nThose three lines were all he was allowed to read. The last one echoed in his mind. Every time he had a moment of peace, sat down for a meal, closed his eyes to sleep, those three lines would shoot through his mind. The last one over and over and over.\n\n*No signs of genetic alteration in any detected species*\n\nThey were natural. Whatever creatures- whatever horrors- these fool pirates had come across harbored an entire planets worth of microbes *naturally*.\n\nGALACTIC YEAR 13.814382120_137\n\n\"Are you ok?\" The human asked, a look of concern on it's face.\n\nIt's face. Crawling with sickness, and disease, and contagion, and infestation.\n\n*Plague. Contamination. Taint. Rot. Decay. Putrefaction.*\n\n**Death. He was looking into the face of Death.**\n\n***He had shaken hands with Death.***\n\n\"Ambassador Slack? Are you ok?\" Death repeated, the look of concern on it's bare, colorless face growing into worry.\n\nSlack's tentacle twitched, and he reached out towards the dispenser held by the Death's attendant.\n\n\"W-... would it be r-rude of me to use th-that as well?\"",

If you unclip and unscrew the panel, you'll see that the LCD has black tape all around it, which you can of course remove. After removing all of it, and a little bit of finicking on the aluminium or plastic clips holding it together, it will come apart with all it's individual layers. You can then carefully lift each one and clean under it, taking caution not to crease them, as they're fragile. I'd also use gloves for this, as you don't want to put greasy fingerprints on the layers. Also, the order of the layers matter, so don't rip all of them out.\n\nAfter cleaning, put the panel back together as good as you can, test it, and then tape it back together. I normally use normal scotch tape, but I would use Kapton tape, as it's \"made\" for this kind of stuff. But it doesn't really matter.\n\nWith a little bit of luck, it will be as good as new.",

    "body": "Hi folks! \nI'm mostly a lurker here, but I saw a comment in another thread that I wanted to address directly &amp; to everyone. Someone commented they used sharpies as eyeliner, and some of the responses seemed curious like 'hey maybe that's a good idea'. \n\nIt's really not. I've been working as an oil &amp; acrylic artist for 20 years, and I work at an art supply store part time for the boss discounts &amp; product education.  I like to learn about the science and chemistry behind art supplies so I can manipulate them better, &amp; so I can stay safe. I just wanted to let all of you know that alcohol based markers aren't safe for long term skin use, are not meant for use around your eyes, and how it's a really bad idea. \n\nOn markers you won't see warming labels about dangerous toxicity levels. You'll see instead the I AP (Approved Product) certification symbol of The Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute, Inc. (ACMI). According to the organization:\n\n\"The new AP (Approved Product) Seal, with or without Performance Certification, identifies art materials that are safe and that are certified in a toxicological evaluation by a medical expert to contain no materials in sufficient quantities to be toxic or injurious to humans, including children, or to cause acute or chronic health problems. (Sandford LP became a member of ACMI in 1986)\nHowever, this does not mean that materials are not irritants or allergens. Such products are certified by ACMI to be labeled in accordance with the chronic hazard labeling standard, ASTM D 4236, and the U.S. Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA).\"\n\nWhat that means is they are safe for the use in which they are intended, which is writing on stuff that's not alive. Incidental exposure is not dangerous or something to worry about either (you get markers on your hands it's not going to harm you). \n\nBut permanent markers were not intended for continued use on skin, especially around the eyes. Ingredients you can find in permanent alcohol based markers (copic, sharpie, prismacolor, etc) are: propanol, butanol, diacetone alcohol, xylene, cresol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and more including whatever is needed to make that color of ink.  All of these except for the ink are solvents, and flammable. Also all have warnings about exposure, especially to the eyes. If you want to look it up yourself check out \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/search.html. \n\nAnd for fun, here's a warning I pulled off of copic's website:\n\n*WARNING\nFLAMMABLE LIQUID AND VAPOR\nHarmful if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through skin\n\nMay cause skin, eye, and respiratory tract irritation\n\nMay cause central nervous system depression\n\nMay cause adverse effects on the bone marrow and blood-forming system\nMay cause adverse liver effects\n\nContains a known or suspected reproductive toxin*\n\n\t\t\nChances are if you need acetone or rubbing alcohol to remove something you shouldn't put it on your face. Btw acrylic and oil based markers are even worse. Don't use those either. \n\nI also want to stress how most of what you'll find in an art supply store should not be used for skin contact. For more info check out. http://environmentaldefence.ca/issues/toxic-nation/healthy-artist-guide-less-toxic-studio. This includes using acrylic as body paint (I've seen recipes online). Acrylic can contain colbalt and cadmium, which is just as toxic as lead.  Single or short exposure won't hurt you, but long term exposure can. \n\nWhen using materials for makeup that are not makeup, know you're taking a risk It can take time for that damage to show up too. If you want to look good at 40, take care of yourself while you're in your 20s &amp; 30s, this includes using products meant for skin. I know, it's not cheap, but you get what you pay for in the long run. It's better to have a few really nice quality makeup products and rock a single look than to use art store products that can cause you eye problems or contribute to you getting cancer later in life (or at best cause you to get crows feet sooner). \n\nDon't buy art supplies and use them as cosmetics. I've seen a couple folks who do, and they are not ladies you want to emulate (I have seen only 2 in the year I have been working there that brag about using markers as makeup and both seem to be slightly mentally ill). Its just not worth saving money to use stuff like that on your face in my opinion. \n\nOk that's all I gotta say about that. Stay safe folks! \n\t\t\n\n\t\n ",

If I wasn't so make-up obsessed, there is A LOT I wouldn't know about. For example, my 29 year old sister didn't know about shadow primer until *last year*. Of course *I* was shocked, but she said, \"Mom never wore make-up, how was I supposed to know?\". \n\nThat being said, I'm glad this OP (/u/Fey_fox) decided to make the post. It may *actually* be helping someone else out who was just too afraid to ask.\n\n/end rant",

I won't list the multitude of ways we used it, but it is a very effective cleaner.\n\nWe always told each other \"don't breath that sh\\*t\" because we viewed it like Chlorine Gas, but even getting the stuff on your skin is bad for you.\n\nIn case you didn't know, CRC's Brake Kleen contains **Tetrachloroethylene**. Numerous studies have shown an highly increased risk of Parkinson's with frequent exposure to the chemical, and liver and kidney tumors in lab rats. Even color blindness! One of my former fellow mechanics suffered from color blindness. Coincidence? Maybe.\n\nIsopropyl Alcohol is a good substitute with far less hazardous attributes.\n\nI know that car guys, especially mechanics; are usually devil-may-care attitudes towards the chemicals and liquids they interact with daily, but this type of information is also useful to home mechanics, with kids and animals in the garage.\n\nNext time you've got a messy brake job or need to clean up some oily parts, maybe think twice and put down the Brake Kleen.

We don't actually need to use DnDBeyond to play, but even then, you can cancel your subscription and still use it for free without giving them a dime. If you already have the books, then you don't have to pay them anything to keep using them. If you want more of the official books, you can buy them used from other people (and I get a feeling that there are about to be a lot more people ready to sell their 5e books here soon).\n\nFor those of you who play in person and like using/painting actual minis, I cannot recommend enough getting a cheap resin 3D printer (I got my own small one for $130). There are free or really cheap 3d models that you can find online or even subscriptions services that send you premade, incredibly high quality models. You can even get water washable resin if your don't want to deal with the isopropyl alcohol.\n\nKeep commenting, ending your DnDBeyond subscriptions, spreading awareness, and SUPPORTING 3RD PARTY CREATORS. Don't give up. And remember, YOU DON'T HAVE TO QUIT THE GAME TO QUIT GIVING THEM MONEY!\n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nCLARIFICATION: Leaving D&D is totally valid and okay. Saying other people are doing a bad thing by continuing to play D&D even without supporting WotC is not. It just pushes people out of the hobby and causes division when we need to be working together to fix the situation.",

Last time I did it, I think I paid around £35-40 for a pair of screens. But, the others are right; 2DS and 3DS jobs have had me swearing and yelling more than any other fix-it job. But, it can be done. It is absolutely not technically complex, it's just really, really fiddly. The wifi aerials have to be routed just right in the bottom casing, you have to be careful of the ribbon connectors as they are very small, and the big one is the routing of the coiled ribbon cable for the top screen through that hinge and then the two small cables *through the middle of that*. That one will really test your patience. But, *it can be done*. Just take your time, go really slow, expect it all to take a couple of hours and you'll be fine.  \nWatch a few YT videos on the process, make sure you have a couple of decent tweezers, and above all else, go slow and careful.",

Almost every other customization technique is ultimately built off the foundation of paintwork.\n\n\n\nThere are **so** many different valid methods to paint--be it by hand or airbrush or even sponge--and what you learn in one discipline is often transferable in another.  There's almost no painting mistake that cannot be undone with a little isopropyl alcohol and some time.  The bar to entry is much lower and much less intimidating than it's popularly made out to be.\n\n\n\nI thought I'd use my recently finished Leo as an example to illustrate all this.  It looks like an absolute mess in the raw plastic, but good priming/surface correction/painting sorted it all out.  Everything was done with the later paintwork in mind.\n\n\n\nIf you haven't considered diving into the world of painting, I recommend it wholeheartedly.   It's very rewarding and there are many people and resources ready to help you, including me!  It's the first step to unlocking a world of fearlessly making whatever gunpla you can imagine.",

I airbrushed them the same color as the plastic. I didnt seal the paint (which you should), but 10+ years later, the paint is now chipped/scratched/dirty etc and now it looks pretty weathered. And it STILL looks damn good. It doesnt look or feel like plastic at all. It added probably a week or two to the build (drying time) but it was minimal effort (just spray and dry). Most of the work was finding the right colors.\n\nIMO even if you don't like painting, just airbrush them. It takes almost no time and it really makes the model look and feel better.",

I have much I would like to discuss with you.\"\n\n\"Uh, sure,\" she replied, opening the door for the two of them. It had been chance that she had been presentably dressed in athletic shorts and her favorite T-shirt instead of lounging in her underwear as she did not expect anyone. \"I'm sorry for the mess, I'm still settling in,\" she apologized as she guided the two to her living room upstairs.\n\n\"Can I get you anything to drink? I've got filtered water, some carbonated Dynoshean sweet drink whose name is impossible for me to say, and some kind of sweet and sour Mipobz drink and a little bit of Trapoynee.\"\n\n\"Water is fine for myself,\" Giok replied.\n\n\"I'll have some of that Dynoshean bubbly, but not too much, just a few [ounces],\" Grindal replied, looking at Giok whom nodded.\n\n\"Okay, let me get the drinks and we can get started. I'm rather curious as to what you want to say to me.\"\n\nBringing out the drinks in mismatched, plastic cups, they all sat at her dining room table. At least, what C'Leena tried to pass off as a dining room table as well as the mismatched chairs.\n\n\"This is good,\" Grindal replied as he sipped his Dynoshean drink, \"it must have been on the expensive side.\"\n\n\"It was! But it was the closest I could find to a soft drink from back home. The nostalgia is well worth the price.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, what do you mean by soft drink?\" Grindal asked.\n\n\"Oh! That means any beverage without ethyl alcohol in it.\"\n\n\"You humans drink cleaning agents?\"\n\n\"I suppose at a high enough concentration it could be used as a cleaning agent, though, we use isopropyl alcohol for that instead.\"\n\n\"Fascinating,\" Giok replied, \"as much as I like learning about new cultures, that is not why we are here.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Boss,\" Grindal said.\n\n\"Madam Thomas,\" Giok asked, \"Do you know who I am?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I can't say that I do.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" Giok replied, \"I am Giok Mulplqourz, sole owner of Star Shipping. I'll come right out with it, as I know a woman of your caliber appreciates blunt honesty.\"\n\n\"You're that businessman that was acquitted of Syndicate conspiracy!\" C'Leena suddenly exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, yes I am,\" Giok replied, \"However, I am a Syndicate Leader, one of five in Woqplw. I come to you to strike a bargain. One that will benefit the two of us most greatly. As an offering of peace, I give you this.\" Giok slowly reached into his coat and pulled out a rectangular, vacuum sealed object. It was thick, lumpy and held multiple warning labels on it declaring it to be a most potent poison and biohazard.\n\nPutting it into the table, Giok continued, \"One [pound] of whole coffee beans, grown from the mountains of Southern Proxima. You may open the bag, but please, do so after we leave. I have no wish to have a [heart attack].\"\n\nC'Leena nodded, picking up the sealed package and looking it over. Besides the obvious warnings, it did declare that it contained a toxic plant seed humans used for agriculture for centuries and was intended for research study.\n\n\"What do you really want from me?\" C'Leena asked.\n\n\"I want you to work for me, off the books,\" Giok said, \"and in return, whatever you need, I'll get for you. Equipment, assistants, materials, new working spaces, doesn't matter. I'll pay for it.\"\n\n\"I have to ask, as this is too good to be true, if I refuse?\"\n\n\"If you refuse,\" Giok answered, \"I would be most appreciative if you remained neutral in the coming conflicts. Additionally, I'll negotiate on an as-needed basis for certain... work, and compensate you on whatever it is we agree upon.\"\n\n\"What if I have other obligations and contracts?\"\n\n\"By all means, those take precedence, it will help with legitimacy. Be that as it may, I have talked to you long enough. We shall make our leave. Do keep in touch, here's how to keep in contact with me. Remember, I'll pay for anything you need if you work for me. However, we must be off. Please message me within four planetary rotations.\" With that, Giok and Grindal left C'Leena to her own devices, leaving proxy contact information.\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nIt was a slow day for Giptz, and so, he perused the InfoSphere for trending articles.\n\n*Human Gets Galactic Alliance Combat Award.*\n\n*Combat Medical Officer, Robert Christian Arroyos, a decorated Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, Medical Division, from even before Humanity had their First Contact, is set to receive Humanity's first Combat Award from the Galactic Alliance Council. The GAC is acknowledging Medic Arroyos selfless acts during the conflict on Dantrixst IV where he single handedly carried over two hundred soldiers back to human medical aid, regardless of what side they were on.*\n\n*Additionally, he went on to save forty other individuals with combat medicine while on the front lines without an armed escort nor protection. His biggest exploit on Dantrixst IV was the expedient deployment of a Forward Medical Base. Using nothing but a highly shielded slab of starship hull, Medic Arroyos employed a tactic he had only used once before. Wielding the shielded hull, he ran from the rear lines to beyond the front, a cadre of personnel right behind him, carrying medical supplies as well as fuel and shield generators.*\n\n*Human and Gloipty troops that had been hiding in trenches, in well established battle zones, abandoned their posts and charged as a single wall, coming to aid their most beloved Combat Medic, risking their lives and limbs to do so. That single act allowed the rest of the ODSTs to engage in a surgical strike across the entire planet. According to Human and Gloipty interviews, those at the Front Lines had been told to 'Defend the Angels, affix bayonets.'*\n\n*Such ferocity and devotion had never been seen before in war. Thus, Human and Gloipty forces, pressing from the front with tenacity only spoken of from Bronze Age Legends, and all other sides on the planet with small, elite teams of ODSTs, ended the conflict in complete surrender. The military employed by the Human-Gloipty Federation totalled twenty thousand. This number includes pilots, drivers, cooks, janitorial, medical, ODSTs, ground forces, engineers and all other required staff.*\n\n*For such a minor force of* volunteers *to lay claim to a planet, only speculation can yield what a proper military force can do.*\n\nSeeing that there was little else to do and that he had already seen the other trending articles, he started up a game on his communication device as he waited for customers to arrive on this particularly slow day.\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nSlowing down her hover bike, Gherd, looked at the small home in front of her. Gherd was a S'prau-ling, one of the very few plant based sapient species in the known galaxy. Parking her hover bike on the side of the road in a designated spot, she confirmed the address she was looking at on the napkin, having copied it down from Rutak.\n\nWhile most species would consider what Gherd was wearing, or rather, lack thereof, to be quite inappropriate, her people considered it to be quite normal. S'prau-lings were a bizarre mixture of mammalian and flora properties. Bipedal creatures with two arms and two legs; hardened bark-like, mildly photosynthetic skin; bright green and lush, leafy and vine-like hair, responsible for primary photosynthesis. In her case, mammary glands in the usual place for upright species, the skin there a darker, more supple green; however, they produced a kind of rich nectar rather than milk. Her peoples young were born live, however, their photosynthetic capabilities developed later in life and required initial nourishment from another method.\n\nThough her people were capable of omnivorous sustenance, they much preferred animal protein and products as they viewed plants as a very distant cousin. Similarly to how most humans viewed other primates. However, due to their photosynthetic skin and hair, their caloric intake was quite low, mostly needing a few key amino acids chains that their hair and skin could not produce.\n\nSmacking her prosthetic leg to get it to work, she quietly walked to the front door and knocked.\n\nGherd hoped C'Leena would see her.\n\n[[NEXT]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/sksfyf/cleena_thomas_prosthetist_ch_17/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nEdit 8/13/22: Fixed Giok's last name.",

The notebook is soft-backed and square, and the paper is quite thin. The paper also feathers badly regardless of what ink I’m using on it, and the case has a slot for chargers, but they’re impossible to get into the little slots. Came in a nice bag, I guess. \n\nThe sketchbook is … kind of pretty, but the paper is just okay and doesn’t hold ink well and makes a mess of any kind of marker sort, especially alcohol markers. The grain of the paper is acceptable but it mostly just feels awful to draw on. It also doesn’t lay flat for gods, love or money so I had to crack the binding to make it functional. \n\nThe pen is … awful. Overpriced junk. The converters don’t fit properly and drop out of the feed randomly. The screw cap doesn’t thread properly and the grip has sharp edges that dig into your fingers. 0/10, maddeningly uncomfortable to write with. Scratchy nib, skipping, just every hallmark of, “terrible pen.” Also the sound of posting the cap with the scraping on the aluminium is absolutely dreadful. \n\nThe shimmer ink has clogged the dickens out of my EDC Kaweco sport, and the bottle of bluegrass velvet leaked all over my desk even though it was capped and had the silicone gasket on the inside of the cap securely in place. \n\nI was able to salvage some of the bluegrass velvet with paper towels and careful application of 99% isopropyl alcohol but it ruined my favourite desk mat and my hands are STILL green. \n\nThe ink chargers are useless. The colours represented on the website are nothing like what I got, and they’re so pale / pastel as to be illegible.\n\nTook forever to ship, customer service absolutely lacking both in punctuality and helpfulness. Bought many of the items on clearance so I can’t return them. \n\nTl;dr: 1/10, an expensive mistake and rather large disappointment. All form, very little function - going to guess most of their money goes into marketing. Fool me once, shame on me I guess. \n\nThey also apparently use genAI and as someone who’s vehemently opposed to that tech, I will never order anything from them ever again.\n\nEDIT: I’m talking about Ferris Wheel Press.

    "body": "I posted this on r/pcmasterrace awhile ago. I thought I'd post this here to give some people a laugh, as well as looking for some advice\n\nI bought a Sapphire Nitro+ RX 570 2 months ago as a gift to myself for my 18th birthday. And just a little while ago, my screen started glitching out and then wouldn't turn on. I tried removing the backplate to see if something shorted, and there I see. A sticky mess of rat pee. I leave my Case closed, and I don't even know how the rat got in there. Well, I guess I'll be spending Christmas and the next few months without a PC. Kinda harsh since I need it for online class too. Lol, I'm literally crying rn aaaaaaa\n\nI'm currently trying a lot of stuff to try to fix it, and I'm hoping for the best\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the advice! I've tried cleaning the area with pee with isoprophyl alcohol, and it boots up. But after a while, the screen goes black, and needs a system reboot to display stuff again :( Is there any way I can fix this in a few hours? I've got a video presentation to submit for school, and all my files are on my PC :(\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of people are getting confused from my post's title. To clarify, my GPU died, not the rat.\n\nEDIT 3: Still no luck. It displays now, but the screen shows a lot of glitches, even if just playing a simple YouTube video. The screen goes green after a while, and needs a system reboot to display. I don't know if this is better than the screen going dark. Either way, I'm still trying to fix this thing, while hoping for a miracle to happen\n\nEDIT 4: I cleaned the card by rubbing isopropyl alcohol with a cotton bud. Waiting for it to dry right now. I'm still hoping for the best aaaaa\n\nBtw, I decided to not RMA the card, since it's kind of a bad move to do it when it really was my fault for not securing my case properly :(\n\nEDIT 5: Thanks for all the awards! Though it's really sad that my GPU has really died now :( It immediately glitches to a green screen on boot :(\n\nEDIT 6: Yep. It's dead. Time to find  a way to earn for a low end GPU. Thank you for all the help, everyone\n\nEDIT 7: Thank you for all the support you've given me! I am so so grateful right now :) I can't believe that y'all would support me like this :)",

You should be able to find the effected area. Most likely will have some corrosion on it. I was able to get mine working again by cleaning this up. I used a combo of tooth picks, coke(could use water and baking soda) and a small wire brush like a toothbrush.  Be careful not to put much pressure down when scrubbing.  Rinse it off good.  Then let it sit for a day in front of a fan. Shake off as much water as you can before hand.  As long as none of the chips fried you might be able to get it working again.  I managed to get another few years use out of mine. Went from getting green artifacts and overheating and crashing to working just fine.  Once in a while I'd still get a lil screen tearing or black screen on one screen when using 4 monitors. But as a broke bitch it was the best option for me.  Good luck hope this helps.  And remember the worst thing you can do if you try is make it not work still... just make sure it is COMPLETLY dry it before you run power through it.",

The antimicrobial ingredients are at far too low of a concentration to really be any better than just using regular soap. \n\nAlso, hydrogen peroxide would be handy to keep on hand if  you are using bleach to disinfect water. Peroxide will neutralize bleach, so if  you don't like the taste or use too much, you can add a little OTC 3% H2O2 to knock it down. It reacts to form salt (NaCl), water, and O2. The amount of salt shouldn't be an issue unless you went batshit crazy with the bleach added.",

Furthermore I think it takes a very practical and sustainable approach to preparation. \n\nFor example, they describe a “daily stockpile” concept where instead of buying a huge surplus of food that you probably won’t eat before it expires, you buy an extra few of the food and consumables you use daily, use them in your daily life, and replace after you use it so your always maintaining as stockpile while also keeping everything more fresh.\n\nI’d also add to spend some time with any tools/items you buy. You don’t want to buy a pair of goggles, throw them in a closet, and find out they don’t fit your head/work with your mask and fog up when you need them most.",

You can disagree if you want and create your own version of the level.\n\n> 1. **Super Primary (SP)**: Very urgent and important. To be prepared before the majority of people starts panicking, doing a panic-buying, or S-already-HTF. You should already have it in hand, in adequate amounts, and already planned for the long term needs.\n\n> 2. **Primary (P)**: Urgent and important. To be prepared after you’ve finished preparing the 'Super Primary' items and whether you have the budget. You are allowed to not have it all in hand, but it’s preferable to have it according to what you need the most.\n\n> 3. **Secondary (S)**: To be or not to be prepared after you’ve finished with preparing the primary items, or whether you have the budget. You are allowed to not have it all in hand, but it’s preferable to have it according to what you need the most.\n\n> 4. **Tertiary (T)**: To be or not to be prepared after you’ve finished with preparing the secondary items, or whether you have the budget. You are allowed to not have it all in hand, but it’s preferable to have it according to what you need the most.\n\n> 5. **Depends (D)**: Very important. Depend on the status and situation: feminine hygiene products, having a pet, elderly in presence, kids in presence.\n\n> 6. **Optional (O)**: Not urgent and not important but sure adds something to your preparedness. You are allowed to not have it all in hand. Also includes any DIY items.",

A face shield is sufficient, or anything that prevents drops from flying directly into your eye. Regular eye glasses help but usually have gaps on the sides so aren't the best.\n- Knife for self-defense is a very bad idea. Unless you're trained in it, you're as likely to get stabbed as you are to stab someone, and you're more likely to simply escalate a situation. A lot of the self-defense items you have listed are illegal in different areas.\n- I'd recommend putting your final section about general tips at the top so you can set the stage for the details after that.",

Even if I didn't, the family I live with would (and in my view should)!) One of those people did thank me for having things in hand, though, as they realized me paying attention and doing this might be incredibly helpful very soon, so at least I don't feel as crazy right now. I've been getting stuff since January (and had let my normal supplies run low, of course, due to a few life things) but with limited time to get to stores. All but about $100 worth of stuff I got is things I'll use within the year anyway. I debated getting a few other things in that category (solar powered charger/generator, hand crank radio) but didn't (I doubt a long term loss of electricity and do have battery radios and batteries).\n\nGood luck to you all!",

Chlorine bleach causes bones to basically fall apart after a while (though in this case, it shouldn't be too severe, since you didn't *soak* it in bleach and only scrubbed it). For future reference, use hydrogen peroxide to whiten bones. For degreasing, soaking in water and plain old dish soap will work--I use Dawn.

The degradation matches the suture line perfectly so the other portion of the skull likely just split there!\n\nVery cool looking!\n\nHere’s a cool article from Penn State with some beautiful pics of deer cranial sutures!

Unbeknownst to me, this fuck up had been brewing and growing in strength right under my nose (literally) for 3 months.\n\nOn March 13, my school announced that due to a certain thing going on the school would be closing for 3 weeks. So I excitedly got home and threw my backpack in the corner of my room and proceeded to game for the rest of the day. I knew my lunch was in there, I just figured it throw it away later that night.\n\nWell, spoiler alert, I didn't.\n\nA week later when we got the news that school was out for good, I took all my books and folders and stuff out of the backpack and threw it at the top of my closet to be forgotten, completely oblivious that I was throwing a week old half eaten sandwich into a closed off dark and humid environment.\n\nWell a couple of days ago, I started noticing a weird tinge around my room. The smell was unpleasant, but it didnt cause any significant discomfort. I didnt think much about it and just pretty much ignored it, that is, until today. The smell was significantly stronger, to the point where it was getting somewhat unbearable. I sniffed around the room a bit to locate the smell, and I tracked it down to my closet, and a little bit more sniffing took me up to my backpack. That is when the reality of the situation started dawning on me.\n\nI quickly pulled down the backpack and in somewhat of a lapse in judgement, decided to open it and see what was inside. I dont know what I was expecting when I did this, but as soon as I opened it a *fucking tidal wave* of the most horrendous and revolting smell imaginable crashed into my face and spread in the room. It was like I'd poured an entire gallon of liquid ass all over the floor. I looked inside, and the entire inside of the backpack was covered in mold. What remained of the sandwich was a horrifying, festering piece of black and white sludge. It didnt even look like a sandwich, more like a diseased alien fungus. With that sight and smell, it took literally all I had to not throw up all over the place. With countless gags and dry heaves, I sprinted outside and chucked the thing in the backyard.\n\nSo anyway, right now, my mom is busy fumigating my room while I'm sitting on the couch typing this and wondering what to do with the backpack. Last week she bought a ton of isopropyl alcohol for disinfecting, and I'm thinking a bottle of that and a lighter should do the trick.\n\nTL;DR: Left my half eaten sandwich in my backpack for a little over 3 months and opened it in my room, effectively releasing a biological weapon in the house.",

With that said the solution for me has always been to just apply more pulling force. get fingers under the cpu (wedged between the heatsink and cpu) and just start lifting up. In my experience pulling it from a single corner tends to release the vacuum easier. It'll be a bit scary with how much force you might have to apply but it should pop right off without any damage",

    "body": "***May 15/2024 Update***\n\n4 years later and it's still working. I thank God every day for answering my prayers. I try not to forget how emotionally defeated I was becoming before my wife found this solution. When I shampooed my scalp would burn. I literally hit the shower floor and cried and prayed asking for help. I was at my wits end.  My wife called me the next day and the rest is history. I will recap the best I can because I am not a frequent user on Reddit. \n\nOriginally I cut out all eggs, dairy, yeast and refined sugars. It was very difficult.  It may have reset my gut flora but I'm not convinced if it helped with folliculitis.  I would clean scalp with a 3.5% neutrogena cleanser every night. That product is discontinued but I suspect any BP cleanser would work.  After that I used isopropyl alcohol in nostrils and behind ears. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Staphacne/comments/428wtm/healthyalmonds_ears_and_nose_method/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nAfter that I'd apply neutrogena 2.5% BP facemask to entire scalp and would go to bed (That product is now called neutrogena AMPM. The AM is BP and PM I think is retinol to help redness. They took one product and split it into two). In morning I'd rinse scalp, apply more and go to work.  After a week or so it started to dry then disappeared.  After a month or so I could touch scalp with no pain it totally felt normal. I continued doing this routine for months I think. Then I started skipping days.  Now 4 years later i just use aveeno apple cider vinegar shampoo and maybe once a week apply BP to a spot or two and they shrink and are gone.  My eating is back to normal.  I feel normal and very grateful. I will say I think a trigger is dehydration and stress.  BP exfoliates scalp.  Imagine your scalp follicles plugged and dehydrated.  When you drink water and use BP the scalp sheds layers, opens up follicles and water/sweat pushes out bacteria and cleans follicles. That's my thought anyway. \n\nI'm happy to see others have also went out of their way to help others aswell (nice YouTube link in comments).  This was a spiritual experience for me.  Every night I would read the Bible after applying the facemask.  I would pray. I came across the book of Job and it was very applicable to me.  I had everything.  A stable job, beautiful wife, new baby boy, nice house and because of the pain it was very hard to be happy. In the book Job was tested.  When I hit the shower that night crying I remained faithful and swore you bastard no matter what I will not turn from my faith. It's similar to Job. Now because of that night I have helped others and those have continued to help others etc.  This is a real blessing. I love you all take care \n\n\nEnd of update \n\n\nI’ll preface this by saying I am not a doctor or anyone qualified to give medical advice.  I just want to share my experiences with this stubborn condition.  \n\nI’m a 38year old male that has been dealing with folliculitis for about 15 years.  In mid 2019 the back of my head broke out very badly I believe as a result of massage oils being massaged into my head.  For this I went to the walk in and was prescribed cephalaxin and dexid4 (I’m in Canada and we don’t have hibeclens) the soreness subsided and within about a month my head started to feel almost prickly.  After about a month I went to the dermatologist and was prescribed 2 months of doxycycline.  This worked but like many others it returned shortly after completion of the prescription.  The dermatologist stated I should have never been given cephalaxin for what I had.  When I got home that November 2019 day I shaved my head and was in disbelief as I had 50 or more bald spots covering my entire head.  It was shocking and emotionally difficult.  \n\nAfter the 2 months of pillls with no end in sight I went to a naturopath and she was great.  We completed a food sensitivity test and it revealed I was highly sensitive to dairy, eggs, yeast and other things.  So I 100% eliminated them all.  At that time I was 176lbs and went down to about 160lbs.  I also was suggested to use tea tree, manuka honey, coconut oils amongst other things. Unfortunately the folliculitis kept re-emerging and I was feeling down.  \n\nAt this point I went to a traditional Chinese medical doctor.  There were more foods eliminated including all refined sugar and all processed foods. I ended up at 150lbs which negatively effected my mental wellbeing.  The comments from people didn’t help either.  The worst part is that I still had folliculitis!\n\nAfter that appt I stopped using dexid4 and opted to use a teatree shampoo.  It felt soothing as I’m sure my scalp was raw from using dexid for a year.  This was a big mistake as 2 weeks later I could feel it coming on very badly.  The worst yet. My scalp was burning and very itchy.  Unbearable.  I sat on my patio and felt broken.  My life was falling apart and I had to have a heartfelt discussion with my wife about how bad a mental state I was in.  The constant burning made it difficult to even converse.  \n\nWhen I got home from work the next day she had a package of neutrogena products she bought and showed me reddit posts she had found.  She bought neutrogena cleanser, spot gel and the stubborn acne rapid clear face mask.  I thought why not I’ve tried everything else.  \n\nWithin a week the spots were drying up and scabbing over.  Within a month the redness was gone and my scalp was white again.  I continued using the face mask every single night for a month or so, then every other day and so forth and now once a week.  My head is clear and my sanity returned.  I’m still in disbelief some days.  \n\nOn top of this I have also drawn information from other people on the forum.  \n\nA user named Healthyalmonds has many posts on eradicating Staph bacteria.  The same can be used to kill other bacteria.  He/she is a biology teacher and has tested 550 students with approx 75% having Staph but not all having symptoms.  I would suggest searching those posts.  In short if the bacteria is in and around your ears, nostrils, belly button and groin then no matter what you do with your scalp it will just be replanted over and over.  Daily pillow case changes are a must as well! \n\nAveeno apple cider vinegar SLS and paraben free shampoo has been my shampoo of choice after speaking with dkm40 about his results dealing with folliculitis.  \n\nTusharpatel92 and solespiremarcus post were also very helpful posts.  Thanks guys. \n\nAnyway my treatment started aug12 2020 and we’re now nov 27 2020 and my life is regained. \n\nI feel happy again.  \n\nI say I have found a 99% cure and that’s because the odd time I feel one spot coming on and after applying the gel, cleanser or face mask it’s gone.  \n\nAlso very importantly my hair has nearly all grown back!  Once the redness and inflammation went down it started growing back.  I have been obsessive about looking at the spots and have noticed tiny hairs breaking the surface surrounded by my normal length hair.  \n\nA part of my routine was getting cleaned and comfortable, applying the mask, drinking a herbal tea and reflecting on my faith and having faith that my prayers would be answered.  \n\nBecause of this condition I’ve grown as a man and feel I need to help others that are suffering.  I know the negative effect this has on a persons life and mental state so if I can help even one person I’m all for it.  \n\nI’m also eating sourdough bread, eggs as well as pasta etc and have had no issues.  That being said I’m still 100% dairy free as I know my body does not like dairy.  Actually I shouldn’t say 100% because I eat Costco organic Greek yogurt and have had no issues. \n\nI also take a 55billion probiotic daily \n\nTake care everyone. \n\nAlso if this doesn’t work keep trying, don’t stop, keep trying.  The world is big and there is an answer somewhere you just have to find it .",

        "body": "Relieved to know I am not alone because the entire primary care and dermatology community has made me feel that way! Mid-30s male. I’ve struggled with folliculitis for 15 years. And honestly it abruptly showed up out of nowhere! Scalp, face, neck, chest, in my nose and in my ears! Several primary care physicians. Renowned dermatologists. Premier medical research clinics. Every single one has either speculated regarding their very broad termed definition of “folliculitis” as well as a plethora of their so-called treatments. It’s almost as if they have gotten fed up or annoyed with me that they don’t know what to do? It’s the same song and dance everytime. I was on Accutane in my teens and though it cleared up my acne phenomenally, I had a very significant depressive episode following treatment when I was 17yrs old. Suffice it to say I’ve avoided Accutane again. I’m aware it may work for this situation, but I cannot risk more pharmaceutical scenarios. But name the antibiotic and various dermatologists placed me on it: minocycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin…. Rifampin! Topicals were the typical garden variety. Several cultures and biopsies; no conclusive explanations. One or two had me wash with hibiclens (chest only as they warned me against using it elsewhere?) All aside, I’ve been there too. Agonizing pain trying to wash my hair and weeping in the shower due to the pain. Became virtually reclusive when it became so severe on my face, neck, and chest…it made my teenage acne seem like a cakewalk. It hasn’t been about vanity, it’s been about sanity. Totally debilitating. I also changed my diet as well and quit drinking and have been on the same diet for 6 years; I’ve been mainly on a modified carnivore diet avoiding gluten, dairy, and eggs. My folliculitis was in remission for two years following a course of very intense antibiotics, but it’s returned. I will not go back on them and am seeking alternatives. Used CLn, T/Sal, and other shampoos. I’ve virtually lost all trust in the dermatology community, which is why I am here looking for answers! Viewed the YouTube video! Very similar to mine yet I have it on the face too. I think I’ll give this a try and let you all know! Thank you!",

    "body": "Hello everyone. This is the \"Where do I start\" megathread.\n\nIf you are new to prepping here are some good basic places to start.\n\n1. Save $1,000 for an emergency fund. An emergency fund is one of the most used preps you will ever have. Both big and small emergencies happen to us all every single day. Blown tire? Unexpected medical emergency? Unexpected home repair? $1,000 will save your ass far more often than a bug out bag. 59% of Americans can not handle an unexpected $1,000 bill. Put yourself ahead of the pack and get that emergency fund started.\n2. Start stocking extras of what you eat, and eat what you stock. You should have 2 weeks of non perishable food that you know how to and can cook.\n\n* if you're on a tight budget don't feel like you have to go out and buy everything at once. When you're out and about grab an extra one or two of what you are already getting. Get a few extra cans of spaghetti sauce, an extra box of spaghetti, an extra can of veggies or whatever you eat.\n* Rice IS a cheap and delicious carb that is a great filler. Dry Beans on the other hand take time to get used to cooking. Do not feel like you have to invest in this if you don't know how to cook them. We prep for Tuesday, not doomsday. If you'd like to buy beans, I would suggest buying canned beans and not dry beans.\n* Have a first aid kit in your home. Know where your medical supplies are and have a stock of them. Band aids, Isopropyl alcohol, Antibacterial ointment, Antihistamines, pain killers, etc. Real world injuries happen and you should be able to handle most of them. There are some great resources out there for building your own first aid kit and there are plenty of premade kits out there that you can buy.\n* Have spare household items. Don't stock just food but have a spare bottle of shampoo, box of tampons, dishwasher detergent, household cleaner, toiletpaper. Etc. Whatever you use the most of you should stock up on the most of.\n\n1. Have all of your important documents in a safe place and have copies of all your important documents. Birth certificate, marriage certificate, SS Card, Insurance cards, Insurance policies, Passports, all sorts of licenses, etc.\n2. Bug Out Bag. Or BOB for short. This is a bag or backpack that you should have to gtfo ASAP in the event of emergency. You should have at minimum $100 in cash, a change of comfortable clothes, copies of all your important documents, chargers for your phone or devices.\n\nOnly after you have your basic preps covered should you be going above and beyond that.\n\n  \nEdit: Another user pointed out another basic prep that I forgot to mention. \n\nHave a basic tool kit and know how to use it. A basic tool kit would include a hammer, pliers, screw drivers of both phillips head and flat head (but really you should own a plug in drill as well with a kit of different heads), snips, an adjustable wrench, a monkey wrench, and an assortment of different screws, nails, and zip ties. There are some great premade tool boxes out there for first timers. Unless you have crazy money don't feel like you need to go out and buy the best of everything all at once. Having basic things and then as you learn to use them invest in better quality. Lots of this stuff can be picked up for cheap at thrift stores, garage sales, and harbor freight. \n\nIf you own a vehicle you should also own a socket set in both metric and imperial. ",

You might not be able to get to the store or the store may be out.

Keep at least a week’s worth always. If a disaster seems imminent, fill other available containers like pots, bathtub for flushing, etc. Also get something like a Lifestraw.\n\nPrep water if you prep nothing else.",

It’s amazing though how quickly the pantry can start to fill up when you make a commitment to get a couple of extras each paycheck. I have been mostly shopping at places like Aldi, but I also go to Ocean State Job Lot and Ollie’s (I even used a gift card I received for Christmas to TJ Maxx for cleaning supplies, hygiene needs, and jams/olive oil/spices), stores that sell buy outs and overstocks. \n\nIt was daunting at first because my cupboards were bare. I’m physically disabled and care for a disabled adult son. It seemed like an impossible task but once I made the decision to do this, I actually feel more empowered. I even have begun to branch out and just bought a dehydrator and a vacuum sealer. \n\nEven if all you can do now is make a list or clean your shelves in your pantry or pack your b.o.b., it’s still possible.",

This is also called hemostatic dressing.\n\n2.) An easy to use tourniquet (and basic directions) - Amazon, local Army surplus, etc.\n\n3.) A black sharpie marker (for marking bites/rashes to see if they've spread, also writing times on limbs for when you put the tourniquet on, etc.\n\n4.) Instant ice packs - the kind that you break the barrier inside, chemicals mix by shaking and suddenly it's cold. I've taken these on school field trips and used them a number of times.They have them at Walmart for a couple of bucks. Ice reduces swelling and inflammation as well as provides pain relief. I've used  [these](https://www.walmart.com/ip/5340366742?sid=9125f4ec-9661-42e6-be51-f3dfc9c1d461) and really like them. They work well!\n\n5.) A suture kit AND a scalpel. In a pinch, a single barbed fish hook and VERY thin fishing line will work, but I'd definitely prefer a suture kit. Amazon has them, and many traveling \"Gun and Knife\" expos have med kits with suturing stuff included. I've had need for a scalpel quite a few times (on myself) and the disposable ones come in handy. Knicking off a skin tag, dealing with a blister that just won't heal, etc.\n\n6.) Solarcaine or another benzocaine based medical cream or gel.\n\n7.) Trauma shears\n\n8.) Needle Nose Pliers, Clean (for first aid only)\n\n9.) First Aid use only Nail scissors for trimming dead skin off of abrasions, trimming suture, etc.\n\n10.) Dermabond (the wound glue they use in the ER instead of suture, good for superficial wounds but burns like a bugger).\n\n11.) Steristrips and Butterfly closures",

    "body": "[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/NjOLw3t2Nh)\n\nI opened my eyes, reading off the results before me with shock. The test designated it as blood, but it was so much worse… oh my god. It took a few seconds to hit me but I still managed to make it over to the trash can before puking my guts out into the garbage. The freshly downed alcohol burned its way back up like hellfire, making me wince and choke. Sho snatched away the paper before it could float to the ground, left behind while I was dealing with my own existential dread. I could see his face turn pale as the same results were read off.\n\n”Human…” He whispered, scanning the paper again and again to see if he was imagining it. Desperately hoping that the results would change before his eyes. “The hell does this mean, Teller?”\n\nI couldn’t even speak, just shaking my head as another heave of anxiety worked from my gut upward. It hit me then that we had another sample, the small, glowing organic material that Sandra took. I grabbed the tube from within the box, emptying it onto a slide to inspect it now. The spore was small, still giving off a faint blue light even out of the natural environment, but no bigger than the smallest grain of sand. Another slide was quickly pressed atop it, moving right under the scope to reveal whatever horrors we may have been down there with.\n\nIt wriggled under the pressure of the slide, trying desperately to escape. As I looked through, small pincers became visible on one end of it, with hundreds of small legs branching off in every direction, scurrying, stressed beyond its limits trying to get out of the new environment. \n\n“It’s alive,” I muttered, moving over so Sho could take a look. “I don’t know what the fuck it is but it’s a living, biological organism.”\n\n”Oh my god.” He whispered in return. Sandra sat in the corner, still out of it but now grabbing at her skin, complaining of an itch. Sho was trying to cry through bloodshot eyes, looking at me as he moved his eyes from the microscope. “We found life on Mars.”\n\n”Great… fucking great.” I muttered, taking another drink and feeling it burn down into my empty belly. My mind was racing, not sure of if I would ever make it off this godforsaken desert planet. Sho continued staring through the microscope now, studying the creature before a thought came to him. As he grabbed a dropper and the remaining blood samples, opening the slide, I almost stopped him. It occurred to me that we’re about to do something bad. That we’ve discovered something that could inevitably kill us all. Yet I couldn’t stop him because of my own curiosity, and apathy surrounding my current situation.\n\n“Look,” Sho told me, gesturing me closer to the microscope now. The thing inside the slide was absorbing the entire sample of blood Sho had just set on the slide, growing as it did. The blue glow pulsed as it absorbed more of the life force nearby, greedily sucking it all up as it grew like a damned tick. \n\n“It won’t stop…” Sandra muttered, grabbing at her skin, pulling on it like she was trying to get something off of her. I noticed scratches beginning to show as her nails dug deeper into her arm. “The itching. It won’t go away. I’m so itchy it hurts.”\n\n”What?” I asked, moving over to her. “What’s itching?”\n\n”Everything…” She shuddered again, a cold sweat shining on her forehead. I could see her growing pale, eyes bloodshot like Sho’s. He was looking at me in fear, an understanding forming in his eyes as Sandra clawed at her skin more furiously. “Everything… crawling… AHHHHHH!”\n\nShe screamed as her nails finally tore through her skin, unleashing a small trickle of blood that began down her arms. Moving. The blood was… moving, pulsating down. As it dripped to the floor under her, it began to scatter, before disappearing, the luminous blue color pulsating, reflecting off the crimson blood like some fucked up police lights. \n\n“Oh. Oh shit…” Sho said, grabbing the nearest sterile tray he could find and starting to beat at the micro-terrors skittering around the ground. It almost reminded me of that Mummy movie, all the scarabs bursting from skin… I shivered, fighting to keep my composure. These things were more like roaches, surviving the hardest hits from the tray as Sho fell to his knees, desperately smashing the tray into the ground to no avail as these things simply absorbed more blood, scrambling for every drop that fell from Sandra, bringing newcomers to the feast along with it. Sandra grew more pale, eventually beginning to shrivel from the blood loss, thousands of the things swarming around, feeding on her from the inside out. I was brought out of my stupor by Sho shouting once more, “TELLER! HELP!”\n\nI don’t know what I was thinking, but I grabbed the bottle of whiskey off the table, took a lighter we used for some old bunsen burners nearby and getting ready, I heaved the full bottle back, getting ready to smash it toward the tile floor with all my might, “MOVE!”\n\nHe pulled away just in time, leaving the bloody tray rattling on the floor. The bottle hit the ground, exploding into glass and whiskey all over. I hit the lighter, getting ready to toss it right after, but before I could something began to happen.\n\nBlue lights across the floor began to sputter out, the organisms stopping where they were and convulsing as the alcohol touched them. Everything that was touched by the spirits began to seize, staying where they were on the ground and thrashing in agony as they died. I could hear a small, guttural scream echoing out in chorus as they died, hundreds going silent one after the other. The occasional one would still crawl from one of Sandra’s wounds, falling to the ground into the drink before writhing in agony like those before it, dying on the floor.\n\n”She’s dead.”  Sho whispered, looking at Sandra’s drained corpse. “They… they killed her.”\n\n”Sho, I need your blood.” I said, already grabbing a scalpel and holding it up to one of my fingers. God… please. I hesitated before making the incision, praying to whatever gods on Earth or Mars that I wouldn’t have those… things in me. Please… \n\nThe razor-sharp blade didn’t even hurt with all the adrenaline running through my veins. I grabbed a fresh slide, squeezing a drop out onto it. I closed my eyes as the other slide was put on top, loading it under the microscope and praying one more small plea before looking down. \n\n“Oh thank fuck…” I breathed a sigh of relief, seeing no traces of the small creatures, just healthy swimming red and white cells. Clean blood. “Sho, come on. We need to be sure.”\n\n”I know… I know. I’m ahead of you.” He said, grabbing a new scalpel and slide to take his own sample. The incision was made, his eyes closing with prayer like mine did just moments ago. We knew before we could get it under a microscope, before we could even get the slide on top. This blood was pulsating, a blue glow from millions of tiny dots almost made it look like there was glitter scattered into the crimson, mixing into a deep purple. He became more pale, “I’m going to be sick.”\n\n”Don’t go on my yet.” I said, grabbing a bottle of isopropyl alcohol from a nearby cabinet. One drop on the slide and I put a top on it, sliding it under the scope to watch and see if my theory had any kind of hope. \n\nIt worked.\n\nThe spindly, glowing creatures were thrashing around on the slide, blue glow sputtering as they seized up just like the ones from Sandra. The blood was left alone, preserved by the alcohol for now as the creatures died off in huge numbers. My belief is fucking vindicated, there might be a way out of this after all. If I’m right, I might be able to save Shoto before he gets drained like Sandra.\n\nThe phone in the corner of the room began to beep, a signal coming in from wherever they were keeping an eye on us at. Running over, I was out of breath before they could even get a word out, making my demands as fast as possible.\n\n“Strongest drinkable alcohol we have. I need it. Higher proof, the better. NOW!” I was almost yelling into the receiver, swear I could hear the guy on the other line retreating from the damn phone. All he gave me was a ‘yes sir’ before Pratt came on the line, voice gruff.\n\n”The hell happened in there?” He asked, anger in his voice. \n\n“Sandra’s dead. Sho might be too, if you don’t get me those drinks fast enough. You might want to have a few yourself, just in case.” I mentioned, pulling back for a moment and waiting for his answer, expecting him to offer some rebuttal to what was happening now. \n\n“Okay. Do what you need to.” He mumbled. Something was off, something about how he was responding to the situation. He was too calm.\n\n”Sir… you assigned this research point, right?” I asked, gauging my words carefully.\n\n”That’s not a question for right now.” He shot back, hanging up the line. \n\n“That bastard knows something.” I muttered, turning back to Shoto and seeing him begin to shake. Just in time, I heard the transfer drawer slam, two big glass bottles being shoved through in a bin. One whiskey like before, and one bottle of… holy shit, Everclear? No idea why anyone brought that up here when there were always better things, but who am I to judge? I uncapped it, shoving it to Sho, “Drink, don’t know how much, but just get drinking.”\n\n”You sure about this?” He asked, grabbing the bottle and taking a huge gulp. His face contorted in disgust as the burn descended through his throat, down into his stomach. Assuming he was on an empty stomach (I know mine had been growling, so it was likely) the alcohol should absorb quickly into his blood, giving us a much more favorable time limit than Sandra had. \n\n”No, but what choice do you have?” I shrugged, uncapping my own bottle and taking a hard gulp. He shrugged, the very act looking like it was uncomfortable for him. I could tell he was starting to hurt, getting that same feeling Sandra must have had before the itching started. The micro-organisms must not be big enough yet to cause that, but I’m sure they were feasting on the blood in his veins as we sat, now passing the bottle of whiskey back and forth, a much more palatable alternative to the Everclear. I kept an eye from him to the digital clock on the wall, every minute passing by in agony. These things died on almost immediate contact, so it was just a matter of letting the alcohol get into his bloodstream and spread through his body. After twenty minutes, we both were feeling nervous, but the time came. “Take two?”\n\n”Guess so.” Sho replied, holding out his hand to me. The scalpel went through his finger, dropping onto the slide I was holding. It wasn’t moving, no pulsating, just still blood. He sighed in relief, but to be sure we loaded it into the microscope. The microorganisms were still in there, but completely still, no glow coming from them anymore. It worked. Sho let out a sigh, holding up the bottle of Everclear and giving a toast, “Cheers to not being drained from the inside, I guess.”\n\n“We have other problems now.” I said, raising my bottle and drinking again alongside him. “God, I need food though.”\n\nI went to the phone, ringing out to security to request something be brought in. There was no answer. Only silence met me on the other line.\n\n”Sons of bitches.” Sho said, moving to the window and beginning to bang a fist against it. “HEY! Let us out!”\n\n”They’re not going to.” I mumbled, looking around at our options. There was that same feeling gnawing at me, knowing something obviously wasn’t right. Pratt knew something about that area, but whatever it was he wasn’t telling us. I sat down in a nearby chair, leaning it back and looking at the ceiling, struggling to come up with an answer to what we could do.\n\n”We could break the window.” Sho offered, a fist still balled up against the glass in front of him. He looked woozy, not holding his liquor very well. Couldn’t blame him either, drinking on an empty stomach isn’t too pleasant. I was only moving around fine because I was so used to it, but he was having a struggle going on in his body. Can’t imagine he was feeling great after the blood loss either. Barely bleeding yet being mostly drained must be one hell of a sensation. “I don’t know man. I don’t know what the hell we should do about all this.”\n\n”Whatever that is is too dangerous to just stay here. I don’t think Pratt has good intentions for it either.” I said, looking straight into the camera in the ceiling corner. “Do you, you bastard?”\n\n“How did that get there though?” He said, whispering in a shaky voice. I could only shake my head and shrug.\n\n”Above my pay grade.” I mumbled, finally getting up after a moment, grabbing one of the metal material carts nearby, and pulling up on the handle to test its weight. “Should be alright. Think you can distract them for a while?”\n\n”I’m going with you.” He said, trying to stand himself, but stumbling instead. \n\n“No, you’re not. I need to move fast.” I said, crouching to get a good grip on the cart, lifting with my entire back into it. “You need to send a message back home about this. They don’t need to send anyone up here.”\n\n”You serious?” He asked, sitting back on the counter now, looking more faint. Adrenaline was probably wearing off for him, with no telling how much longer he would stay conscious. \n\n“You saw how quickly that killed her, right? She’s just your baseline. That stuff thrives on blood, and if it gets back home, what was all this for? Terraforming fucking Mars just to bring death back to a dying Earth? Useless.” I began ranting, yelling as I stepped toward the observation window. No going back now, I heaved one more time, tossing the cart with all my strength.\n\nThe glass shattered, scattering the floor outside in the hall. I draped a fire blanket over the edge, scraping broken glass off before I climbed over. \n\n“Toss me the iso over there.” I shouted back to Sho, who began to grab the alcohol from the cabinet nearby. \n\n“The hell are you. going to do?” He asked, tossing one bottle at a time over the broken window sill to me. \n\n“We didn’t see how far that cavern went back. I’m going to see if I can find a source.” I mentioned, pointing to a bag that was left over one of the lab chairs, which Sho promptly tossed over. Loading the bottles in, I started off, moving back towards the cafeteria. “Stay safe, I’m going to take care of things.”\n\n”Be careful!” He shouted after me. “Unlock the door, too!”\n\nFlipping the lock as I passed by, Sho slipped out and started going the opposite way, though where I have no idea.\n\nIt took about ten minutes for me to make it into the caf, blowing past the poor cook on duty, taking every bit of alcohol I could, piling it into the bag, then beelining for the garage. I quickly found out where Sho had been, finding him struggling for breath, leaning against the wall leading into the locker room nearby.\n\n”Suit’s in the RV. I told them to open the door as soon as you’re in to let you out of the garage. I raided the other labs for iso too so there’s more in there. It’s just kind of thrown in though, that’s all the energy I had.” He was barely able to get the words out through labored breaths.\n\n”Rest. I’ll try to come back. Thank you.” I said, patting him on the back before running through the door, scrambling into the still dusty RV we made the original journey in.\n\nThat thing went faster than I had ever taken it, blasting through martian deserts with no regard to the rocky terrain underneath. It was a much faster journey than the first time, and as I approached the formation popping up in the distance, I started mentally preparing my list. I was going to attempt taking the buggy down the entire way, crossing the path between seas on it as far as I could go. There had to be something at the end… somewhere back there. Some way to stop these things from ever making it out of here.\n\nI loaded everything into the buggy before even deploying it, hardly letting the RV come to a stop before opening the bay doors. The entire backseat was filled with enough alcohol to make a college frat house sick, so hopefully it would stand up to whatever this was. It didn’t seem to take much to kill them, but my fingers are crossed regardless. The buggy was out in seconds, rumbling down the path into the cave. I didn’t even care about my own safety at this point, just hitting the pedal to the floor and hoping for the best.\n\nWhen the blue light began to glow from beyond my headlights, I finally started tapping the breaks a little. The cavern opened before me, lumescent blue in the great dark maw above making entire star systems. God, it would be beautiful if I didn’t know what the hell it was. Vibrant blue fell from up high, dropping into the blood sea like snow over the ocean, pulsing brighter as it settled into the warm lifeforce below. I pressed on, turning on the brights on the buggy and carefully making my way onto the jagged rock path in between. The blood that was overtaking it made waves as my wheels passed through, making the blue twinkle as it was tossed up in my wake, responding to the stimulus. I heard a loud scream, echoing off the cave walls yet miles away. Something knew I was there.\n\nThe brights of the buggy didn’t cut through the darkness as well as I had hoped, but I pressed on still, always keeping an eye on the path ahead. Eventually I could see that the cavern was narrowing again. The seas on either side were beginning to reflect off smooth walls, maybe two or three kilos into the cave, judging by the meter on my dash. My path stayed consistent though, a split in the red sea bringing me ever closer to what lay beyond. High above, the same pulsing kept going though began to slope inward toward something in front. At some point it looked like a tunnel of stars in some amusement park ride, except with the metallic scent of blood punctuating every part of my surroundings.\n\nThere. Up ahead. The light continued to pulse but much brighter, like a concentration of whatever was causing it. My brights began to reflect off the smooth cave walls around me, the seas narrowing further as the path met the wall, leaving only small trenches on either side of me leading back to the sea. It almost looked to be flowing this way, but I couldn’t tell well enough with the light provided. Until I hit the full force of the glow, finding the end of the cavern abruptly. \n\nWhatever it was… it almost looked human. At least, at one time it did. Centuries or eons ago, I have no idea, but this thing looked like a bastardized giant, a face with eyes only, millions of them covering the top half of it. These eyes were the source of the blue pulse, ringing through the entire cavern like a beacon to the others. I could see massive versions of the damned things. These parasites, crawling to and from near the base of the giant, exactly where the rivers of blood stemmed from. They were tearing at it, sucking greedily from the rivers as they tore at the thing, trying to empty more blood into their pit outside. The thing’s mouth was open in a twisted scream, creatures crawling in and out with seemingly no purpose but to reproduce inside and out. Once they had drank their fill of the sustenance flowing from the giant, they climbed back to the cavern ceiling. These were the glowing stars that were hanging above us the whole time, dropping their growing offspring down into the seas to grow strong.\n\nOne caught site of me in the bright lights of the buggy, letting out a guttural shriek and running toward me, hundreds of skittering legs holding up a slender body, blue light glowing brighter as it sensed fresh prey. I grabbed one of the bottles of Iso nearby, undoing the cap and splashing it when the thing came near. It fell back, screaming loud and alerting the others nearby as steam sizzled off its skin, hundreds of huge eyes glaring at me with hatred and hunger. My presence was known now, with nothing left to lose, I started uncapping bottles, emptying them into the rivers flowing from the giant, bright blue specks floating like little islands on the surface. \n\nThe plastic bottles of iso were all emptied when the screaming from others started, blue pulsating against the flowing red underfoot and pale flesh of the dead god in front of me. The things began moving forward, lights all combining into one dazzling show as they scurried toward me, fear shining in their eyes for what I was doing. I kept one of the iso bottles to cover my way out, but not before pulling the lighter I had loaded into the suit pocket, flicking it right into the very flammable alcohol that was now floating around on top of the blood in front of me.\n\nThey screamed louder as the flames roared high, giving me my first real look at them in full light. These things were extra ugly, the bright light serving only to bring prey in to them. Underneath, millions of dark eyes were staring me down, hatred filling them as I burned their potential young before their eyes. I didn’t care. I saw what they could do. This wasn’t natural, this wasn’t good, this… this was just pure evil. Made to devour and reproduce. The flames grew high in front of me as I threw one of the drink bottles further, letting the flames mix and spread. There was enough room for me to three point turn the buggy while they were still struggling against the flames, and I stepped on the  pedal once more, opening bottle caps as I went back the way I came. Each bottle was emptied into the seas alongside me as I drove, a couple of drink taken by me in the process just to fight off whatever nerves were still cutting through my adrenaline. \n\nAs bottles were emptied on the way back, I could hear loud splashes far off in the distance, huge stars dropping from above to leave massive impacts in the sea, buffeting the buggy and threatening to throw me over the side every which way. I was struggling just to stay on the path, even more when I could see the larger blue glows skittering toward me, the surface tension of the seas letting them walk like it was nothing. \n\nI don’t know how I got out, but I just kept emptying bottles until they were all gone. When I finally hit the entrance, hitting the incline to go back up, I stopped to throw one last bottle of rum at the wall, seeing it smash as it hit the smooth, carved etchings in the wall. Striking a flare, I sent it sailing toward the broken glass, igniting the alcohol. To my surprise, the fire began to spread through the carving, ascending the wall with fervor and lighting up the entire surface with no discernible pattern in the flames, eventually overtaking the cavern ceiling above. Screams echoed from every direction in the cave, as the creatures hit a fervor, the path of flames I had left floating on now frothing seas of blood behind me. \n\nThere was no way in hell I was sticking around to see what the flames did, screams chasing me all the way up as I almost put the pedal through the damned floor. I made it out into the harsh Martian sun, almost blinded from the total darkness down below. \n\nI don’t know if Sho was able to get the message out. Hell, I don’t even know if the alcohol is going to be an actual answer to the issue or just a bandaid to keep them at bay. I’m typing everything up now in the RV though, trying to send a message out back home to tell people. I know there was nothing I could do if they got out, and I know it would be the end if they got back to earth. There’s probably going to be some kind of inquisition when I get back to base, probably going to get arrested, hell. Considering how shady Pratt was acting, I don’t doubt they were after this thing to utilize as a weapon or something.\n\nWhat’s to come is a mystery, but for now I’m going to just keep moving forward. There’s no telling if I’ll ever make it back to Earth alive, but I’ll do my best to keep it safe from here. From these damned things. God, I need a [drink](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/rkcl1rGqib).\n",

I beat P3R and P4G and ordered this from GameStop to play after. \n\nWell, we were getting ready to move to another state when it came in the mail, so I didn’t test the game on my 3DS when it arrived: \nI decided I would open it when I was ready to start the game and that day was today. But Alas, my 3DS can read the game on the Home Screen, but when I start the game, it says it can’t be read. \n\nI can’t return it anymore, so if anyone has any suggestions for fixing this issue, help a brother out. I’ve already tried isopropyl alcohol to no avail. \n\nI just want to watch Maze of Life on my 3DS ;/",

Depending on your 3ds model you might need a screwdriver to remove the back cover of your 3ds to get to your SD (still really easy and simple).\n\nIf you don't like piracy remember that you already bought a copy, also Nintendo shut down their services for the 3ds so modding your 3ds is the way to go imo (even if you are not interested in getting games for free  other than the game you bought, you can get a lot of benefits from modding it, like installing custom themes for your home screen, playing online again via private servers, and much more).

No advanced technical skills required.\n3. iFixit's **\"Kobo Libra Colour Screen Assembly\"** kit has everything you need.\n4. iFixit's guide seems to contain some unnecessary steps - use your judgment.\n\n**Questionable steps**\n\n* **Steps 15–17: Soften the motherboard coating**\n   * *“If you aren’t replacing the white interconnect cable, skip this step.”* \\- I wasn’t replacing the cable, so I skipped it with no issues.\n* **Steps 27–28: Apply isopropyl alcohol to loosen the screen** \n   * I managed just fine using a **plastic card -** no alcohol needed.\n* **Steps 54–56: Remove the light sealing tape & button board** \n   * These came pre-installed on my replacement screen, so here was no need to remove them from the old one.\n* **\"How to Transfer the Motherboard Button Bracket\" guide**\n   * I ignored everything in that guide except for reinstalling the motherboard. Worked perfectly.\n\nIf you're planning to do this yourself and have any questions, feel free to drop a comment or DM me!\n\nP.S. May the unbroken reader be with you - always!",

    "body": "Day 1: \nMy 14yo son tested positive on Tuesday 10/20. I picked him up after school from his open gym and says “I’m not going to lie, I’m not feeling well.” I get on him about him wearing his mask under his nose, asking about hallway monitors, is there even one way traffic (???) nagging at him like a mother does. His symptoms were headaches, and body fatigue. I didn’t take it seriously because he usually complains of being tired especially since he goes to school pretty early and he just got done playing basketball. We get home and I checked his temp, it was 99.8. I nagged again about his dirty room and told him that if he had the virus he’d have to stay in his dirty room for 14 days. I’ve had fevers, I’ve had fevers at 101.2 a month ago and got tested, it came back negative. I was hoping it was the same for my son. I told him to clean his room and settle for a bit in case it was due to the hot weather in Houston and playing basketball. In the meantime, I registered to get him tested. I checked his temp again and this time it was 101.8. We were requested to come in 30 mins later, we both wore a mask in the car, he sat in the back, in the back of my mind, he isn’t positive but wearing a mask was needed because there was the gut feeling of what if he was. We arrived to the facility and followed the blue line back to the testing station. There were two people in front of us, a mother and daughter. We stood there in silence, waiting. He was next and I joked with him since this was his first test, it’s not that bad, they swab your brain a bit and his eyes smiled. They gave him a PCR test, they told us they would text if he was negative or call if it was positive and to be safe. He sat in the back, I noticed his eyes fixated outside the window, deep in his thoughts. I could tell he was worried. We arrived home and he immediately went to his room, just in case. I grabbed a trash bag and handed it to him “Make sure you get all your water bottles and trash out the room, here’s a trash bag.” Yes, it was that dirty. 45 minutes go by and I get a phone call, the caller ID says ERLC, it was the facility. “Hello?” Hi.... it’s...... numb, confused, shock, fear, worried, what if, why, how, no. I’m so sorry, just keep him well hydrated, keep his fever down and if symptoms get worse, go to an ER. I hang up, inhale, exhale, composed myself, put on a mask and walked towards his hallway and knocked. “You’re positive, you have COVID, I’m so sorry, but you’re going to be ok. Are you ok?” It’s a lot to process for a 14yo. He’s silent for a few moments and I can tell he was trying to find his words. I tell him it’s going to be ok, the one time where I couldn’t come inside his room to give him a hug, it was heartbreaking and I was sad for him. I didn’t know know what to, my husband wasn’t home yet, I can’t fix this, what do I do. My mind was racing, my heart breaking, sadness and fear was overwhelming. My husband came home 10 mins later and I broke the news to him, he walks to his door and asked if he was ok. At this point I’m crying, I step away. His dad immediately steps outside in the fron yard to make a phone call, I go out the back door. Who do I call? I can’t call my mom, she passed away in November last year. Who do I call? I try calling my sister but she doesn’t answer. Who do I call? I needed someone, a family member who works at a hospital. I text my cousin who works in the disease control department in the hospital she works at in Los Angeles. “Are you busy?” send “I really need to talk to someone.” send. She immediately responds “Call me.” And I completely break down. She gives me a list of things I needed: Isopropyl Alcohol, spray bottle, Lysol, gloves, disposable masks, Clorox wipes, Tylenol (no aspirin) to keep his fever down and body aches, Oscillococcinum. A list of what I need to do at home: Keep him hydrated, keep his fever down, check his oxygen (has to be above 94) quarantine, mask up anytime he leaves the room to use the bathroom, spray down everything in his path with alcohol or Lysol (doorknobs, hallway, bathroom fixtures, toilet, everything he touches needs to be sprayed down), leave his food at his door (when he’s done, have him leave it outside his door), have a special trash can (leave trash at door when full). “You’re going to have a mini hospital in your home, but you need to be safe because you have asthma. He’ll be fine, a lot of kids have bounced back from this. He’ll be fine.” I am so thankful for her. My husband meets in the backyard and needed to talk to me, so I hang up the phone with her. “We have to take him to the ER, he needs to get medicine, he needs a Z pack, he need this and that and this and that.” I have been advised that the only time we should go to an ER is when he can’t breath. “I think taking him to an ER right now is a rash decision, he has very mild symptoms, I don’t think we should go.” We decided to go get tested ourselves (even though we didn’t have any symptoms, but just in case) and in the meantime, I requested to get supplies to get our house in order. 45 mins later, we received a text while I was in Walgreens at 11p to come to the facility. I didn’t get everything I needed, I forgot a few things. It’s ok. We leave, got tested and 45 mins later we were both tested negative. So he got it from school, assuming from an asymptotic person, a person without any symptoms. I hope at this time everyone is socially responsible enough to stay home if they had symptoms, I had hoped this was the case, even if they were high schoolers. We let my son know via FaceTime and he was happy for us. But now it’s time to take precautions at home, here are the rules to keep us safe: stay in your room as much as possible, wear a new mask every time you need to leave your room, use the clorox wipes on everything you touch, throw the mask away in your special trash can, text me, call me FaceTime every time you need to leave your room so I can mist the air with alcohol in your pathway when you go back to your room, text me, call me, FaceTime anytime you need anything, I will leave your food on a table, everything you eat will be with disposable plates, cups, utensils, they will all need to be thrown away in your special trash can, when it’s full-tie it and spray the handle with alcohol so I can throw it away outside, I’ll leave a new trash bag at your door, your medicine-supplements and gummies will be on a napkin with your food. “Call me anytime, day or night, whatever you need to be comfortable.” End of Day 1, temp 101.5\n\nDay 2: \nI’m up for work. I get a call from his school nurse asking about him. I was told that he may need to get retested because I received the results really fast and it sounded like the test was a rapid test which is common for false positive results. I immediately call the testing facility and asked the difference between a rapid test (15 min) and a PCR (polymerase chain reaction-45 min) and confirmed our tests were indeed PCR. This was the first the school nurse has heard of a facility that provide this type of testing in our area (it’s a good thing). He sleeps till 11a. He FaceTime’s me, “I’m hungry, can I have some soup?” “Ok let me check your temp, meet me at the door with it cracked open?” Masked up, gloves on, his temp is 99.7. I make him some Chicken Tortilla Soup with a pack of saltine crackers. “Can you make it spicy for me, like really spicy?” I put some extra extra Cayenne Pepper in it. All in disposable bowls, utensils on a paper plate with his medicine, vitamins and supplements. I deliver his food on top an Amazon cardboard box I propped for him as a table (it was all I had) and knocked “Your food is ready!” “Ok” proceeds with a happy dance. At least he’s happy. He FaceTime’s me “the soup is delicious, but it’s not spicy enough.” Lol! I can hear him watching his favorite shows like Naruto, he’s laughing. He watches sneakhead videos on YouTube. I check his temp again around dinner time, 98.8. He requested Chicken Tortilla Soup and crackers again and I asked him if wanted fruit cups with his vitamins and supplements, he thanked me with another happy dance at the door. The COVID District Nurse calls and we did a three way with my son to begin contact tracing. I could tell he sounded sad but the nurse assured that the was for the safety of his friends and in no way shape or form that this is to put blame or embarrassment for him. Only safety. The rest of the night he talked and clowned around with his friends. Goodnight son 😘 \n\nDay 3:\nHe woke up today around 9a, emailed his teachers and took a Art Zoom class. He said he was the only one in class. He ate some waffles and a fruit cup, this time he says “I really do feel like I’m in a hospital.” His temp is 98.4. Wow, ok symptoms are mild, just a runny nose and hoping for the best. House safety protocols have been put in place successfully. He’s doing great at following directions. We FaceTime constantly and at one point I had to hug my phone because I miss him so much, even though he’s only across the hallway. 2 hours late he requested for Chinese Food. I was told day 3-5 would be the toughest, but I’m hoping for the best. Send us healing and positive vibes.",

I don't even remember what I watched but it helped the time pass when I wasn't sleeping. \n\n\nIt's scary but keeping an upbeat spirit and carrying on despite the fear will help you both get through it. I will say one word of caution, not to scare you but to make you aware, that days 7-10 seem to be the turning point for most people. It seems around that time people either get alot better or alot worse. Perhaps pediatrics are different than adults, I am by no means no expert. Just chiming in from my experience and others. For me it was day 10 when I could finally stand in the shower for 1 minute (which was a massive accomplishment for me at that time). For my friend day 7 was when her symptoms just vanished. Keep an eye on his oxygen and have a plan if/when things get worse/better. It'll keep you calm and collected. \n\n\nKeep at it! We are all rooting for you both!",

My four family members I live with tested negative, with my dad testing negative the day I tested positive and he tested negative again yesterday. Technically, today is day 11 of my quarantine (I began showing symptoms last Monday) and I was cleared to leave on day 10. \nI think you and your husband should consider getting retested at some point in the next 3-5 days just to err on the side of caution. \nThe best thing for your son is tons and tons of rest and fluids. I took vitamin c and d supplements, zinc, oil of oregano, turmeric, and beetroot to help out a bit.   If you do choose to give him oil of oregano, turmeric, and beetroot, please make sure he takes the pills with a meal because it can cause some pretty gnarly nausea otherwise. I also recommend getting a pulse oximeter just to keep an eye on o2 levels. Any chest pain is no good, especially for his age. I had to go to the ER on Friday as a healthy 23 year old female due to severe chest pain and pressure from covid, which ended up being inflammation of my lungs. \nAlso, if at all possible, it may be helpful for your son to go for very small walks outside if he’s up for it and can do so without coming into contact with anyone. I think in hindsight while I’m on my own covid positive journey, I wish I would have gotten out of bed more, even though it felt impossible at the time. Moving around a bit will help ease his mind. \nSending you and your family all the positivity ❤️ y’all got this",
