Simply did this quick comparison for myself upon hearing about the reformulation of one of my long term favourite products, Hada Labo's gokujyun premium lotion, and thought this sub might like to see it to to save you some time. Also I'm on mobile so apologies for any dodgy formatting. And yes, I'm using emojis as a sort of key, don't hate me pls\n\n\nHUGE credits to the Ratzilla Cosme blog who has both ingredients lists up on their site already (she translates it herself from the Japanese bottles). \n\n//\n\nKEY: \n\n❤️ = Star ingredients\n\n⚠️ = New ingredient\n\n⬆️⬇️ = movement of top ingredients up or down the list, i.e. possibly higher or lower concentrations \n\n//\n\nObservations at end of post & a TLDR ... \n\n// \n\n\n [ORIGINAL PREMIUM LOTION INGREDIENTS](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/hada-labo-gokujyun-premium-hyaluronic-acid-lotion/)\n\nwater\n\nbutylene glycol \n\n❤️glycerin \n\nPPG 10 methyl glucose ether \n\n❤️hydroxyethel urea \n\n❤️1. sodium acetyl hyaluronate \n\n❤️2. sodium hyaluronate \n\n❤️3. hydrolized hyaluronic acid \n\n❤️4. hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate \n\n❤️5. sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer \n\n❤️sacran \n\nhydrogenated starch hydrolysate \n\nglycosyl trehalose \n\n❤️diglycerin \n\nsorbitol \n\npentylene glycol \n\ntriethyl citrate \n\ncarbomer \n\npolyquaternium 51 \n\nPEG 32 \n\nPEG 75 \n\nammonium acrylates copolymer \n\ndisodium EDTA \n\npotassium hydroxide\n\ndythoxyethel succinate \n\ndisodium succinate \n\nsuccinic acid \n\nphenoxyethanol \n\nmethylparaben (removed in new formula) \n\n\n///\n\n\n[NEW PREMIUM LOTION INGREDIENTS ](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/hada-labo-gokujyun-premium-hydrating-lotion-2020/)\n\nwater\n\nbutylene glycol \n\n❤️hydroxyethel urea ⬆️\n\npentylene glycol ⬆️\n\nPPG50 methyl glucose ether ⬇️\n\ndipropylene glycol ⚠️\n \n❤️diglycerin ⬆️\n\n❤️2. sodium hyaluronate\n\n❤️3. hydrolized hyaluronic acid \n\n❤️1. sodium acetyl hyaluronate  \n\n❤️4. hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate \n\n❤️5. sodium hyaluronate cross polymer \n\n❤️hyaluronic acid ferment filtrate ⚠️\n\n❤️hydrolized sodium hyaluronate ⚠️\n\n❤️Sacran \n\nhydrogenated starch hydrolysate \n\nglycosyl trehalose \n\nsorbitol \n\ntriethyl citrate \n\nPEG32 \n\ncarbomer \n\nPEG75 \n\ndisodium succinate \n\npropanediol ⚠️\n\ndythoxyethel succinate \n\npotassium hydroxide \n\nsuccinic acid \n\ndisodium EDTA \n\npolyquaternium 51 \n\ncaprylhydroxamic acid ⚠️\n\nhydroxyethelcellulose⚠️\n\nxanthan gum ⚠️\n\nphenoxyethanol \n\n\n//\n\n\nSo, let's look at the 7 new additions: \n\nDIPROPYLENE GLYCOL \n\nVery commonly used solvent, humectant and binder. Has \"great skin moisturising properties\" according to [Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dipropylene-glycol). Safety rating of 1-2 (very safe) on [Cosdna](https://www.cosdna.com/eng/b05d771602.html). This is likely nothing to worry about unless you already know you have a sensitivity, as it is mostly there to keep the formula feeling elegant and seems to be mildly hydrating. \n\n//\n\nHYALURONIC ACID FERMENT FILTRATE \n\nNew kind of hyaluronic acid that Hada Labo claims will \"help fortify the skins moisture barrier to help skin looking plump and supple\". This is the most controversial addition as many people are sensitive to ferments and this product will unfortunately now be unsuitable for them, which is a real shame. However, if you are someone who enjoys ferments, this might sound rather exciting. I couldn't find much info when I searched \"fermented hyaluronic acid\", but Ratzilla's list seems to suggest that the HA has been fermented with Lactococcus bacteria, which is proposed to \"positively influence both the speed and quality of epidermal growth, resulting in better barrier function and overall skin quality\" ([Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactococcus-ferment-lysate)). I'm not convinced a difference in effect will be extremely noticeable alongside the 6 other kinds of HA but I expect it will work well for plumping and improving the health and appearance of the skin regardless. \n\n//\n\nHYDROLIZED SODIUM HYALURONATE \n\nThis is a super, super tiny (low molecular weight) version of hyaluronic acid, which is intended to penetrate even deeper into the skin and moisturise deeper than standard HA. If your skin wasn't bothered by the Hydrolized hyaluronic acid (another smaller molecule form) in the original formula (still in this one too!) then you might well not be bothered by this version too. Source: [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-sodium-hyaluronate)\n\n//\n\nPROPANEDIOL \n\nCommonly used solvent, humectant and emollient. In short, makes formulas more cosmetically elegant and also helps to pull moisture into the skin and keep it there. Considered very safe and a non-irritant. Further reading: [byrdie article](https://www.byrdie.com/propanediol-for-skin-4773491) [paula's choice ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/propanediol.html)\n\n//\n\nCAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID \n\nAn anti-fungal amino acid derived from coconut oil that acts as a preservative. Limited data regarding safety, but Honest Beauty claims it is safer and less harsh than other commonly used preservatives (take this with a grain of salt as Honest Beauty has an agenda to push and so will be biased). Sources: [truth in ageing ](https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/caprylhydroxamic-acid)\n[honest beauty ](https://www.honest.com/blog/wellness/ingredients/what-is-caprylhydroxamic-acid/13775.html)\n\n//\n\nHYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE \n\nUsed as a thickener in cosmetics, gives a nice slippy, gel-like feeling. Water soluble, regarded as safe. \n\n//\n\nXANTHAN GUM \n\nExtremely commonly used thickener and stabiliser. Unlikely to be an issue unless you have a specific sensitivity to it. \n\n\n//\n\nAnd now, let's look at the changes in the top few ingredients: \n\n• The top ingredients, which I usually regard as the most important, have changed in that normal Glycerin has been removed and replaced with Diglycerin, and it's now the 7th ingredient as opposed to the 3rd. Diglycerin is not much different as both are powerful hydrators, but Diglycerin supposedly \"penetrates slower into the skin but gives longer lasting moisture and less sticky, better skin-feel.\" Source: [incidecoder ](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diglycerin) This might be good for people who have tried the original Premium and found it to be too sticky on the skin! However, due to it being moved lower down, the impact might not be too obvious here. \n\n• Pentylene Glycol has been bumped way up the list from 16th to 4th! This is another thickening ingredient that is key to the sensory feeling of the product, and according to incidecoder its also a moisturiser and helps to hydrate and smooth the skin. However, [the derm review ](https://thedermreview.com/pentylene-glycol/) actually claims it doesn't have any specific skin benefits, but is at least safe and non-irritating. I personally would rather have kept a higher concentration of glycerin or diglycerin in the product as opposed to this as I think they're more intensely moisturising/hydrating to the skin. \n\n• On the other hand, urea has been moved from the 5th ingredient to the 3rd, where glycerin was previously. From [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea): \"A derivative of Urea, that works as a strong moisturizer and humectant meaning that it helps the skin to cling onto water and thus to make it hydrated and elastic.\n\nAccording to manufacturer's data,  Hydroxyethyl Urea has a similar moisturizing ability to glycerin (measured at 5%), but it feels nicer on the skin as it is non-sticky and non-tacky and gives a lubricous and moist feeling to the skin.\" \n\nSo, perhaps this formulation could actually remain equally as hydrating, if not more so, but less sticky due to the removal of glycerin? \n\n//\n\nTLDR: \n\nSo, apart from the ferment all the new additions are commonly used ingredients - nothing toxic, irritating or comodegenic! In theory (best case scenario) it should be even more hydrating due to the extra two forms of hyaluronic acid, and potentially less sticky due to the removal of glycerin and higher concentrations of urea and Diglycerin! Worst case scenario is that the concentrations of HA have been lowered and it won't have the same deeply plumping effect, only time will tell. \n\nThis is getting very long and my thumbs are tired so I'm going to end this post here even though I could potentially go on, hopefully this helps some people make an informed decision on whether they'd like to try the new formulation. I personally have already ordered a bottle as I'm not concerned by the addition of ferments and in general it doesn't look bad at all. Fingers crossed it's somehow even better than the original!!",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing.

This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened.

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "**CoTZ Sunscreen Review (Part One?)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogkbnjalmbc51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74541de92caf8a4ccb74b007f922509d62a1848b\n\nWell hey there!\n\nAfter striking out with a number of Supergoop! face sunscreens (more reviews coming soon)…I decided to incorporate a new brand into my routine in hopes to give my skin a chance to recover. I really dove into ‘Best Mineral Sunscreens For Dark Skin” videos/posts and ended up purchasing a number of recommendations. The CoTZ Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen came up a few times. So, I grabbed that along with their Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen.\n\nBoth products are 100% mineral based sunscreens with 20% Zinc Oxide as the UV protector. The tinted version contains Mica and Iron Oxides for color but outside of that the formulations are nearly identical. Various silicones, preservatives, and texturizes make the list for both products.\n\nCoTZ focuses on mineral based sunscreens that are relatively “clean” and suitable for sensitive skin. No dyes, fragrance, or essential oils are here which is nice to see (and a nice change from the potpourri bowl that is Supergoop!). The brand name itself stands for Contains Only Titanium Zinc…a nod to the focus on physical SPF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/er2a827mmbc51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03a682918bc1a5e6fca56553c0f80811ed71ed0c\n\nBoth sunscreens have a rather thick/creamy texture that in turn applies a bit heavy as well. But, this heaviness absorbs down within a couple of minutes with a “residue” that I don’t have an issue with. Those that have kept up with my reviews (LOL) know that I really like that K-Beauty glow/near shiny look. These sunscreens from CoTZ provide that for sure without being greasy (for me).\n\nBut aside from the application and feel…the white cast (or lack of) from these mineral sunscreens is really what sets them apart. The very minimal white cast from the non-tinted version and the total lack of white cast from the tinted is something I have not experienced from a Zinc Oxide based product before. Seriously…I was ready to grab every other SPF in my stash and give it all away. “This is all I need for the rest of my life!” I thought LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qm8hmunmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0981a2fd35f82b034386bb64e24973b9264ef8d\n\nThe Sensitive Non-Tinted Sunscreen does start to show its mineral roots after a few layers throughout the day (especially when exercising/sweating). But still, the white cast is minimal compared to other products I have used. As for the Flawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen…I could just layer and layer that stuff on. I think this particular tint is just a really, really good match to my skin tone. It totally masks any white cast and disappears into my skin. CoTZ isn’t kidding with their “Vanishing Zinc Oxide” marketing.\n\nI won’t throw out my other sunscreens just yet LOL…and will keep testing/reviewing mineral sunscreens from brands like Australian Gold, Elta MD, and Versed. Hopefully there will be some more winners in the bunch but for now I am happy to say I have found my new favorite sunscreen brand. The tinted version would be my overall go-to but with the tint liking to transfer to my face masks…I find myself reaching for the non-tinted version just as often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwzwmadpmbc51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a59f1d13f6e5e23331ac0775bed47c48cfe860b\n\nHonestly, I think anyone who has struggled with finding a decent mineral sunscreen should give these a try. My only hesitations in recommending them would be if you have particularly oily skin, need something that can stand up to a good workout, or really prefer a matte finish SPF. These two products will range from dewy to rather heavy depending on your skin type and neither really “dry-down” all the way. CoTZ makes some primer/matte style sunscreens and I am tempted to give them a go.\n\nI’m so happy to have stumbled across these two sunscreens as they were a much needed reprieve from Supergoop! (not everything has been a miss so far from that brand…but most everything LOL). Part of me wishes I would have invested in the entire CoTZ product range and reviewed that vs. Supergoop!…ah well.\n\nNeedless to say I’ll be keeping a couple of bottles of CoTZ sunscreens in my stash going forward. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nSensitive Skin Non-Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nFlawless Complexion Tinted Sunscreen: **Active Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide 20% **Purpose:** Sunscreen **Inactive Ingredients:** Bismuth Oxychloride, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG 10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Iron Oxides, Mica, Microcrystalline Wax, PEG-10 Dimethicone, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Stearyl Dimethicone, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Water\n\nWhere To Buy (Link To CoTZ Site - Prices Vary Depending On Product/Size): [https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/](https://cotzskincare.com/mineral-sunscreens/)",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\". These have different names because they're pseudoceramides and/or a part of a patented biomimetic system/delivery method.\n\nSkin Identical Ingredients/ceramides/helpfuls highlighted in **BOLD** except for hyaluronic acid because I can't tell if high molecular weight or low molecular weight HAs were used (some find LMW HA irritating).\n\n*Fragrance = essential oils & artificial fragrance, left in fragrant extracts (less concentrated than essential oils)*\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Curél Intensive Moisture Facial Cream**](https://www.ulta.com/intensive-moisture-facial-cream?productId=pimprod2009883) **- 1.4 oz/40 g -

Still probably way higher than most other brands).\n\nThough with these products in general, particularly for the ones with “real” (not pseudo/ceramide precursors), honestly I would be shocked if they were present at more than 0.1 %. Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations. Maybe I’m too cynical, but a >1% concentration of any ceramides would be such a HUGE selling point (not to mention very expensive to produce) that I can’t believe they’re not advertising it\n\nLike Regimen is coming out with one and they are trumpeting the HELL out of it (and I mean fair enough)",

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "Hi All,\n\n\n\nSomeone posted a thread asking for an affordable sunscreen recommendation, and I thought I'd share the comment again.\n\nI actually made a post about it last year, but obviously it's gone to the bottom of the list. I hope it's okay to post about it again, since summer is very soon.\n\n\nI also kind of want more people to buy it. It feels sad that not many people know about it, when in my opinion it's really good. I have tried la Roche posay, nivea uv face, and I really think this one is better. But of course be careful and check the ingredient list!\n\n\nHere was my comment:\n\n\nI really like the asda sun cream which I have been using for 2 years now since discovering it one day - ASDA Protect SPF 50+ Face Q10 Anti-Age Sun Cream. I have the most sensitive skin, probably one of the most sensitive skin types you will ever meet due to my chronic eczema, and this one doesn't irritate me at all. To be honest, in the last year my eczema has been under control, and I was using this, so I can't say that it worsened my skin.\n\n\nIts only £2.40 so I think it's worth a try, and its UVA rating is very high- more than my nivea face uv sunscreen for £15ish (which burns my eyes). The only issue is that it's not matte. For me that's ok, as it covers my cracked and flaky skin. But you might want to try their matte version, which is the same price. If you want to try this one I am happy to take a picture/video of its consistency for you?\n\n\nHere are its ingredients:\nAqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Tapioca Starch, Coco-Caprylate, Undecane, Tocopheryl Acetate, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Silica, Panthenol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Tridecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Xanthan Gum, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Ubiquinone, Sodium Hydroxide, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citronellol, Limonene, Tocopherol, Linalool, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil\n\n\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck.",

        "body": "Hey OP, just wanted to give my opinion on this. After seeing this post I went out and grabbed some as I have an ASDA close-by. I have dry-normal sensitive skin and wanted to give it a try considering the great price. Only been using it today so its only a first impression but so far, so good! \n\nNo cast, sinks in nicely though it did leave me a bit greasy initially but after 10 mins or so it faded and looked normal, can barely tell I even had it on. I cut out my morning moisturizer as I figured it would be rich enough to cover that as well and I was right. I definitely wouldn't moisturize then apply this, the SPF is all I need. \n\nI have notoriously sensitive eyes so admittedly I haven't tried it in that area yet as I had to go out and didn't want to risk burning eyes so I used my usual SPF (the bondi sands one) and then applied the ASDA one everywhere else and I've had no issues. \n\nI will be trying it around the eyes tomorrow though as I'm not going anywhere. You may have just saved me a lot of future money OP so thanks! Even if it doesn't work around the eyes I can at least apply it to the rest of the face and use my usual in that area meaning it will last longer so its win/win really.\n\nUPDATE: So I've now tried it around the eyes and it felt fine for the first couple of hours, however after that I did experience some very mild burning in the eye area. Having said that, when I say \"very mild\" I mean really, really mild. If I was out and about I probably wouldn't even notice it as it only lasted a couple of minutes and then stopped. \n\nI would still class this as a success. Mild for me is still an improvement over most SPF's I've tried since my eyes are so sensitive. I will continue to use this and possibly just use my usual SPF around my eyes and the ASDA one on the rest of my face. Which will make my more expensive one last a lot longer since its only going to be used in the eye area.",

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

My derm was not happy lol. She stripped my routine down to the basics of cleanser/moisturizer/sunscreen. Specifically, she also switched out my regular moisturizer for this one because it has colloidal oatmeal ([https://democracyskin.com/collections/facial-moisturizers/products/aveil-creme-avoine](https://democracyskin.com/collections/facial-moisturizers/products/aveil-creme-avoine)) and apparently that’s supposed to be super anti-inflammatory. It fixed my face like a fkn fairy godmother. I’ve never been an ingredients-person per se but guys, now I’m just like, let’s not even call this oatmeal, it’s more like G.O.A.T.meal\n\nEDITS: Adding more details to keep with review guidelines\n\nSkin type/conditions: Combo (oily in the summers/dry in the winters) with sensitivity/barrier-compromise. Acne scars/dark spots/hyperpigmentation.\n\nClimactic conditions: Hot semi-arid summers, cold and dry winters (so temperatures fluctuate but mostly dry throughout the year except during the monsoon)\n\nAM routine: JUICE TO CLEANSE Biome Ac Foam Cleanser, AVEIL Creme Avoine, LAKME Sun Expert Ultra Matte SPF 40 Pa+++ Compact\n\nPM routine: DERMALOGICA PreCleanse Emulsifier, AVEIL Creme Avoine\n\nAge: 25 - 34 years old\n\nUsage timeline: 2x a day, for 1 month\n\nIngredient list: Aqua, Glycerol, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Octyl Stearate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Cetearyl Alcohol & Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-6 Distearate (and) Jojoba Esters (and) Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (and) Cetyl Alcohol, Myristyl Myristate, Squalane, Caprylhydroxamic Acid (and) Caprylyl Glycol (and) Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance\n\nStatus: Holy Grail\n\nTexture: On the spectrum of lotion to moisturizer, lotion being light and moisturizer being fuller, this definitely leans toward the moisturizer side. But I wouldn't call it \"heavy\". It's pillowy almost instead of being watery. And it absorbs super quick. In general, I'd recommend it as a nighttime moisturizer or if you've got normal to dry skin or if it's cold and dry out",

    "body": "So there are roughly 12748 reviews of the Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin toner. Apparently it's actual magic, according to said reviews. However! There really don't seem to be any reviews of the **Softfull** Booskin toner. Like really zero. I looked. A lot. To my knowledge it isn't discontinued or anything (it's still available for purchase on several websites), so I was surprised that there was just so much...*nothing*. \n\nAnyways, I'm going to leave a review here in hopes that it will help someone else down the road. \n\nFor reference, my skin is combo/oily, dehydrated and clog prone because I have giant pores. My skin is not a fan of denatured alcohol or silicones, but otherwise I'm not sensitive to much. Fragrance is okay with me, too.\n\n**What it Does:** According to the product descriptions, the Softfull Booskin is meant to \"control unnecessary and excessive sebum and prevent shine to boost clear and clean skin. Optimizes condition of oily skin after cleansing to [enhance] the effect of the next stage of care. Creates moisturized skin inside and smooth and matte skin outside.\" Oh, and my favorite part: \"Creates cotton veil for soft and gentle skin texture like downy hair and fills moisture evenly with tightening effect.\" \n\nOh man, skin that feels like downy hair? Sign me up! #goals\n\nWhat I've gathered is that, like the Moistfull Booskin, it's meant to be a hydrating/prepping toner for oily skin. That's how I've been using it, at least.\n\n\n**CosDNA Analysis:** \n\nUnfortunately, this one isn't on CosDNA. Only the Moistfull Booskin shows up. ;-; I've tried finding it on the Enprani website, buuuut since my Korean isn't the greatest (re: um mostly nonexistent), it didn't exactly go well. If anyone out there knows/has access to the exact ingredient list, I would *looove* to see it! I don't have the box, because this was purchased used from r/asianbeautyexchange. I know, I know. Sorry guys. \n\nI don't want to assume it's similar to the Moistfull Booskin because I genuinely have no idea. I will say that all of the product information I *was* able to find say that Rose of Jericho extract, witch hazel and cotton seed are a few of the star ingredients.\n\n**EXCITING UPDATE:** The absolutely lovely u/ganbattelilone was kind enough to post an ingredient list for me AND add it to CosDNA! Here you go, dears:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (licorice), Phenyl Methicone, **Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract**(this is Rose of Jericho), Propylene Glycol, **Witch Hazel Extract**, **Cotton Extract**, **Artichoke Leaf Extract**(improves elasticity), **Spiraea Ulmaria Extract**(this is meadowsweet- anti-irritant), PPG-16-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Triethylhexanoin, Fragrance.\n\nThe only potential trigger is the ever-present butylene glycol. \n\n*The following geek out is totally optional. Just skip down to the next part if you don't care about me nerding out over ingredients. I won't be offended, promise.* \n\nRose of Jericho is sweet, you guys. It's called the \"resurrection rose\" because it survives crazy desert climates by curling up into a dead-looking root ball. Once it detects moisture though, BAM! It opens up and comes alive [like this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41z0ifszDnL.jpg). Cool, right?! Apparently trehalose (a sugar) is responsible for this. In the plant, it regulates metabolic function to conserve energy; on skin, though, it binds moisture and gives a similar \"revival\" effect. \n\nIts dynamic nature is what (allegedly/anecdotally) makes it such a great skincare ingredient. Supposedly the extract contains some of the same enzymes that allow the plant to respond to its environment, which translates to skincare that's better suited to your specific skin/moisture levels. I couldn't find any scientific research on topical usage, so I don't know how true that is in general. I only know that biologically that makes sense to me and my own experience seems to support that reasonably well. So take it with a grain of salt.\n\n(ﾉ^ ヮ^ )ﾉ✧:・ﾟ✧ *OKAY GUYS /NERD RANT BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED REVIEW:*\n\n**My Experience:** \n\nI've been using this for ~3ish weeks for my morning and evening routine, as well as whenever I sheet mask.The first few days I used it, I did a split-face test to see 1. if it would cause a weird reaction, and 2. to see if it actually made a difference for the rest of my routine. \n\nOh boy. It made a huge difference. I was genuinely shocked by just how immediate and pronounced the difference was. I felt like my face was lopsided because the Booskin side was so soft and bouncy and the other side just wasn't.  \n\nThe bottle is huge, and I don't usually need much.The toner itself is very liquidy; it's really only slightly more viscous than water. The bottle has one of those tops that aftershave or hot sauce have where you need to tilt and shake it to get a couple of good splashes out. I like that, though, because it keeps me from accidentally spilling it everywhere. I use two splashes into my clean hands, pat them together and then pat the toner gently all over my face with my palms until it's fully absorbed. It absorbs quickly and my skin immediately feels softer and more hydrated. I don't have a cool digital skin analyzer (YET) but I *know* there's a difference in moisture levels. \n\n**There is definitely a scent.** And it lingers. Personally, I really love this part, but I know a lot of ABers are not in the Fragrance Fanclub. The scent is not overpowering at all, though. It's soft, feminine, a little powdery, a little floral, and a little bit of something else I can't quite place. Honestly, it just smells nostalgic to me, but not in a \"my-grandma's-Avon-perfume-from-1979\" way. Honestly, I'm happy it hangs around.\n\nIt makes every other product in my routine absorb quicker, and I feel like it helps the other products do their job better too, including my sheet mask essence. I guess that's the \"optimizing skin and enhancing care\" part! As for the controlling excess sebum aspect, I have been waking up with consistently less oily skin than I had been prior to adding this product to my daily routine.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** \n\nI love this toner. I was never really into toners of any kind prior to this. I was of the opinion that they were mostly just a waste of time and money. I'll definitely be repurchasing this one, though. It does exactly what it's advertised to do, and it does it *very* well. I'm super happy with how well this impulse buy worked out.\n\n(ﾉ ^ ヮ ^ )ﾉ✧:・ﾟ✧  **4/5** Would definitely repurchase!   ",

    "body": "I was on the search for the perfect fragrance free oil/balm cleanser for quite some time. I love to do double cleanse to make sure I remove all the sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of first cleansers/cleansing balms so I thought I would do a quick review here for anyone who is interested. My standards when it comes to a good cleansing balm/oil: fragrance-free, effective, but gentle on the skin, doesn’t over-dry the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone.\n\nAll the products I buy and review here completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing, potentially irritating plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus). So here we go:\n\n**Versed Gentle Cycle Hydrating Milky Cleanser:**  **•**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water/Aqua/EauOlea Europaea (Olive) Fruit OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed OilPropanediolVitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed OilGlycerinCaprylic/Capric TriglycerideMusa Sapientum (Banana) ExtractMagnesium Aluminum SilicateLactobacillus Ferment LysateSclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed OilAvena Sativa (Oat) Kernel ExtractRubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit ExtractLeuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment FiltrateTocopherolCitric AcidSodium Lauroyl SarcosinateXanthan GumEthylhexylglycerinSodium BenzoatePotassium SorbateSodium Hydroxide\n\n**My thought:** This product has a milky texture that is easy to use, effective and also gentle on the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes, but there are a few things to note: 1/ It doesn’t spread very far on the skin so you have to use quite a lot of product to cover the entire face so the bottle doesn’t last very long. 2/Even though the product is fragrance free, there’s a light banana scent due to the banana extract in the formula. So if you’re not fond of the banana smell, you might not like it.  Overall, it’s a great , gentle formula and one that I might repurchase.\n\n**Updated review (11/10/22): I recently repurchased this product again and noticed there are little grainy particles like sand in the product. I'm not sure what they did to the product but my sensitive skin can't tolerate scrubs or any physical exfoliant so I won't be using or repurchase this product again.**\n\n**Good Molecule Instant Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polyethylene, PEG-8 Isostearate, 1,2-hexanediol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Citric Acid.\n\n**My thought:** This product used to be only available in the scented version (loaded with potentially irritating essential oils), but due to customer demand, they decided to make a fragrance free version (thank you very much). I’m not sure if the scented version is still out there, so make sure you check the ingredients carefully before purchasing. This product come in a tub with a small spatula that you can use to scoop up the product. I do like this cleansing balm, I think it’s very effective and a little goes a long way. You don’t need to use much to cleanse the entire face. It’s also gentle enough to use around my eyes without any irritation. One con I can think of about this product is the smell. Even though it’s fragrance free, it has a chemical smell that is quite strong which I guess comes from one of the raw ingredients in the formula (though I’m not sure which one exactly). I think some people might find it unpleasant, but it’s still better than adding fragrance or essential oils.\n\n**The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Laurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**My thought:** This product has a cream texture that is quite thick coming out of the tube, and once it’s on the skin, it does require a lot of massaging, then the texture changes to oil as you work it in. Even though it’s gentle on the skin, I find it a lot less effective than other products on this list. This is not a product I would recommend for someone that wears a lot of makeup or doesn’t like to take a long time removing makeup at the end of the day. Even if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, I think there are better products out there. Personally, I wouldn’t repurchase it because: 1/It requires too much rubbing and effort to make it work. 2/I find it does irritate my eyes a little. 3/you have to use a lot of product to cleanse the entire face and the tube doesn’t last very long.\n\n**The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n**My thought:** This product comes in a tube, similar to the packaging of the ordinary squalene cleanser, but the texture is different. It comes out of the tube like petrolatum jelly. Because it’s quite thick, it doesn’t spread very far, so you have to use quite a lot of product to cleanse the entire face. It’s gentle on the skin and eyes, and leave my skin very soft afterward, but I think it will not work well for someone that wear a lot of makeup. I consider myself a minimal makeup wearer and this product couldn’t remove my eyeshadow completely. I also notice that the texture of the cleanser is not completely smooth, it’s slightly grainy due to the small pieces of oat which I do not like. I will not be repurchasing this product.\n\n**Jordan Samuel Skin The After Show Treatment Cleanser for Sensitive Skin:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Aqua/Water, Sucrose Laurate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobiliss Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**My thought:** This has to be the worse balm cleanser I have ever tried. It has a jelly-like texture coming out of the tube, and it goes on the skin just fine, but it just doesn’t cleanse off when I rinse my face with water. It barely remove makeup and leaves my face with a layer of residue that feels oily. I feel like I have to follow up with another cleanser right away or risk breaking out. I hate wasting product but I couldn’t make myself use this one so I threw it out after trying a few times. Sadly, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbeth-30 Tetraisostearate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olive Fruit Oil, Water, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate (Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), Jojoba Seed Oil, Ceresin, Dextrin Palmitate/Ethylhexanoate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, BHT\n\n**My thought:** this product is a very popular Japanese cleansing oil, and for a good reason. It’s affordable, cleanses quickly and effectively, without leaving any residue behind. 2 pumps are what needed to cleanse my entire face. If you’re someone that wear a lot of makeup and need something that can remove make up fast and effortlessly, you will love this product. Some cons about this product: 1/ it can bother my eyes sometimes if I get it too close to the eyes. I thought i just throw this out there in case anyone has super sensitive eyes. 2/ It might be hard to get in in store. You have to order it online and it might take some time to arrive.\n\n**Isnt Tree Micellar Melting Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Sap , Opuntia Ficus-Indica Seed Oil , Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Squalane\n\n**My thought:** This is a liquidy cleansing oil that comes in a pump bottle. It’s thin in texture and gentle, but effective. It’s also non irritating to the eyes, and rinses off well. Compare to the hada labo, it’s a thinner oil, and I have to use more product than Hada Labo to cleanse my entire face. I need 3 pumps for Isnt Tree as opposed to only 2 pumps for Hada Labo. If you are deciding between the 2, I would recommend Hada Labo. It’s just as effective if not more, the bottle lasts longer, and more cost effective as well.\n\n**Purito from Green Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Vegetable Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**My thought:** This oil cleanser come in a pump bottle similar to the ones from Hada Labo and Isnt Tree, but the texture is thicker than the other 2 brands. It’s effective, but gentle and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I need about 3 pumps to cleanse my entire face. Overall, it’s a good cleanser but I still prefer the Hada Labo because it’s cheaper, works just as well, and the bottle lasts longer.\n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient solvent), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate (emollient cleansing agent), Diisooctyl Succinate (emollient), Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters (emollient cleansing agent/emulsifier), Trihydroxystearin (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (emulsifier), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant).\n\n**My thought:** This one has a balm like texture coming out of the tube and spread easily on the skin. There’s no residue left behind after cleansing. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn’t sting my eyes and is also effective. It has no discernible smell, which is nice since some fragrance-free products can still have an unpleasant smell due to the raw ingredients used in the formula.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-10 Isostearate, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Seed Water, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Water, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**My thought:** This is the most recent product that I've tried and is my current favorite. If I have to choose only 1 balm/oil cleanser to use, this would be the one. It replaces my previous favorite cleansing balm from Paula's Choice. The texture is smooth and gentle on the skin. It spreads more easily than Paula's Choice's and has no detectable scent. \n\n**Other plain oil options I’ve tried that work well:** When I run out of my balm cleanser and haven’t purchased a replacement in time. I usually use plain oils to remove my makeup. But because plain oils do not contain emulsifier, they don’t come off with water, so I have to immediately follow up with a water based cleanser to rinse off the oil residue on my face. Here are 2 oils that I like to use:\n\n**Coconut oil**: thicker oil, best for people with normal to dry skin\n\n**Jojoba Oil:** thinner in texture than coconut oil, best for oily and combo skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Top 3:** \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser**\n\nIf you have a favorite oil/balm cleansers that are not on this list, please share with me in the comment :)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "This is so cool! I love seeing people as committed to zero fragrance/irritants as I am! I'm definitely going to keep these in mind for reccing balms in the future since I don't usually mess with those.\n\nFor context, I'm dry skin and sensitive + acne prone, plus have keratosis pilaris. A cleansing oil I would highly suggest to try out is\n\nKOSE SPEEDY cleansing oil. Here is the current ingredient list https://incidecoder.com/products/kose-speedy-cleansing-oil\n\n you'll see a lot of different listings since they reformulated a lot but this is the right one. \nIt is a very light, well emulsified oil that rinses cleanly and doesn't overstrip. Spreads very well. Doesn't leave a residue. It is even good as a solo cleanse! This is my default recc for any skin type or with any condition. I have people with rosacea, eczema, and ichthyosis using it so I'm very confident in its gentleness. In the US, there's 1pack 7.8oz for $13 or 2pack with 1 full and 1 refill for $20 on Amazon. Some have mentioned being able to find it at Daiso stores in US and other countries. \n\nSo this second one I've only used for a week but I begrudgingly have been pretty into it as I'm more on the dry side. It's the Neutrogena lightweight body oil fragrance-free https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/body-oil-fragrance-free/6861830.html\n\nIt's a very low-viscosity watery-freling oil and it has good spreadability. Works really well at getting into pore for that deep but gentle clean you want from oils. It's probably the gentlest one I've tried even more so than my DIY sunflower/grapeseed + Polysorbate 80 I've made. The \"problem\" is that the Neutrogena oil does not rinse well at all. However I think it might good alternative for people who have tried other oil cleanser and found the emulsifiers just made it too much for their skin but don't want to use a pure oil. It does mostly come off with the gentle second cleanse. It will leave a bit behind in your skin, but as someone dry I quite appreciate that slight buffer for the cleanser and it hasn't caused any issues or broken me out. My skin does actually feel quite a bit more comfortable and less dry since introducing this when this was the only change. It does feel decently nourishing without being overwhelming. It definitrly lives up to its claims if used this way. Normal price is $13 for 8.5oz but can be found for $9-10 on sale sometimes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but my skin has already decided it likes this, so... 😒\n\nAs my gentle water-based cleanser, my current favorite is the Pipette baby wash and shampoo fragrance-free https://www.target.com/p/pipette-baby-shampoo-wash-fragrance-free-11-8-fl-oz/-/A-79503241. I get a lot of funny looks when I recc this but it's genuinely the best thing I've found that is on par in gentleness with some of the better non-foaming cleansers like the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser and is more affordable. It has amazing spreadability and you don't need a lot. I have gone through 4 bottles and am about to repurchase because I'm too hooked and it's insanely cost effective compared to most facial cleansers. Normal price is $8 for 12oz, it's commonly on sale for $6.50ish and one time I caught it for $4 so I stocked up hard. But I'd be happy paying $8. I also use it for body and hair so 😳 I felt it was worth mentioning since it's the second cleanse I follow with.\n\nI'm definitely gonna be taking a look at more of your content now as well! Thanks :)",

    "body": "I’m From Mugwort Cream\n\nThe mugwort line from I’m From features some of my favorite soothing/calming products. Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/660kxqxxhrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f44858c40b452cc060e2e1922a84175baf307379",

I use the dry touch one for my face and the normal lotion for my body. It's basically the same formula.\n\nI'm not going to stop wearing sunscreen just because he said that, but I am willing to look for a different sunscreen formulation that doesn't taste so bad lol. Can anyone recommend a sunscreen that's kissing friendly😂. It has to be fragrance free and essential oil free. And budget friendly as well. I like picking up 200 ml bottles since I use it on my whole body. \n\n\nBionike Defence Sun Lotion Spf 50 ingredients:\naqua (water), ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, dibutyl adipate, pentylene glycol, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, dicaprylyl carbonate, triacontanyl PVP, niacinamide, aluminum starch octenylsuccinate, tocopheryl acetate, sodium carboxymethyl beta-glucan, carnosine, caprylyl glycol, dimethicone, potassium cetyl phosphate, ethylhexylglycerin, panthenol, allantoin, acrylates/vinyl isodecanoate crosspolymer, caprylhydroxamic acid, glycerin, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, sodium hydroxide, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate",

    "body": "Waitrose have a skin/hair care line called 'Pure' which is fragrance free, hypoallergenic, cruelty free and uses mostly 'naturally derived' ingredients, whatever that means. It's also really cheap, and regularly on offer. I know this isn't a hair care sub, but their shampoo and conditioners are fab, and extremely good value. The dry/damaged conditioner is how I make it up to my hair for bleaching it to all hell. \n\nAnyway, I got a few of the skincare products a few months ago when they were doing 3 for 2. They're now on 1/3 off, so I thought I'd post some mini-reviews. \n\nI would describe my skin as oily, somewhat congested, and quick to anger. It’s also probably somewhat dehydrated by bad office aircon and just, like, winter in general. \n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Hot Cloth Cleanser** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-hot-cloth/508007-539993-539994\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Candelilla Cera, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa Powder, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Aqua, Tocopherol,  Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Phytate\n\n**Verdict:** God, I wanted to like this. I love hot cloth cleansers, and this one was so simple and cheap - and it even comes with a cloth! However, the rice powder totally ruins it for me - using a face cloth is exfoliating enough, and I don’t want even a gentle scrub on my face. If you are super into scrubbing your face, this might be perfect - it’s not going to rip you to shreds like walnut shells, and it’s not illegal  and murderous like microbeads. \n\nI was very sad about this until I realised that what I did now have was a super-luxurious body scrub. I used it the other day - I spent a long time massaging it into dry skin before taking a hot shower and washing it all off with a sponge. Because the cleanser’s so rich, my skin was very soft and moisturised afterwards, and a couple of days later the patches of KP I had were almost gone. I might do it again next weekend - it’s not really a weekday type thing because rubbing it all in takes ages, washing it all off also takes ages, and they’re both kind of the point (it’s sort of like a soothing diy massage) so you don’t want to hurry it.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Facial Oil** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-facial-oil/862289-541045-541046\n\n**Ingredients:** Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil,  Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Prunus Persica Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid\n\n**Verdict:** Blergh. I sometimes do really well with facial oils - I really love the Boots Botanics Organic one - but this was just a nope all round. Bar the absence of smell, it just feels like I rubbed coconut oil into my skin. I shine with a thin film of grease. I might try it on my hair, maybe? Or try doing the OCM with it? I will say this, the packaging’s nice - a lovely frosted glass bottle - so I suppose if nothing else I can empty it out and put other things into it. As you can see, I’m trying really hard to find positives here.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Day Cream SPF 15** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-day-cream-spf-15/450717-539849-539850\n(It says ‘this product is unavailable’ but it’s definitely for sale in multiple shops.)\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Zinc Oxide (Nano), Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Simmondsia Chinesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Phenoxyethanol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Aluminum Stearate, Sodium Phytate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isostearic Acid, Alumina, Methylpropanediol, Tocopherol, Sodium Hydroxide, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Disostearate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate\n\n**Verdict:** Hell to the yeah. I really really love this moisturiser, and have just rebought it as I’m getting near the bottom of the jar and it’s on offer again. I think it’s just that my skin is a big fan of zinc oxide, since I find that Sudocrem also calms my skin down a whole bunch. It’s thick and creamy, and feels very protective against the winter wind, and it’s the only thing that seems capable of withstanding a day in the weird dry recirculated air in my office. It’s not every day you find a physical-only sunscreen for such a low price, either, even if it is only SPF15. There’s a slight whiteness as you rub it in, and people with darker skin tones might find it leaves a cast - I’m not sure, as I haven’t noticed one, but my underlying skin colour’s quite pale and so it’s not always visible on me. On days when I especially don’t care about ruining the SPF aspect (ie most days right now because it’s deepest winter and I’m barely leaving the house anyway) I will often mix in a bit of Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nThe Pure Natural line is even cheaper. In particular, I think it’s great that they offer some really basic thick face creams with no fragrance. I’m probably going to try out their SLS free face wash at some point.",

TL;DR is that it broke me out pretty bad.\n\nIt’s got a really thick jelly-like consistency, with no fragrance. Its literally like jello, which was kinda cool tbh. It feels pretty good on the face and it dries down a bit tacky, but doesn’t feel very moisturizing personally. I was excited for it but unfortunately it broke me out soooo bad. I had little bumps and whiteheads everywhere. I haven’t broken out that bad in probably a year or two. I don’t even breakout that bad on my period. I didn’t put it on last night and my skin is almost clear again, so I know it’s that, and it’s definitely a no-go for me. If you’re interested, here’s the ingredients, and my routine will follow. \n\n\nWater (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, PEG-240/HDI copolymer bis-decyltetradeceth-20 ether, Niacinamide, Trehalose, Squalane, Centella Asiatica Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Ve), Tocopherol , Propanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Gellan gum, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Tromethamine, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Potassium laurate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nMy (general) routine is:\n\n• Banila Co cleansing balm\n\n• La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash for Oily Skin\n\n• Stridex\n\n• Olay Complete Lotion Moisturizer with SPF for sensitive skin\n\n• Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream\n(I put on both moisturizers with *wet* hands, not damp)\n\nHope this helps someone out!",

    "body": "**Full product name:** Versed Guards Up Daily Mineral Sunscreen SPF 35\n\n**Available:** Target or Versed directly online \n\n**Price:** $22 USD for 50 mL\n\n**About my skin:** Very dry, Fitzpatrick III, Rosacea, extremely sensitive skin and eyes\n\n**Climate:** SF Bay Area (so spring-like almost all year, lots of sun)\n\n**My relationship with sunscreen:** I hate suncreen and most sunscreens hate me. I can't use any of the US chemical filters and use others sparingly. I hate the smothering feeling of a lot of sunscreens and have had a lot of trouble finding ones that I tolerate. My skin is also so dry that zinc can be problematic because it's often drying/matte. I'm currently using: Kinship Self-Reflect Probiotic Sunscreen and Biossance Squalane + Zinc. I've tried (and hated) a bunch: Avene SPF 50 Mineral Suncreen, Cerave SPF 50 and SPF 30 mineral suncreens, Blue Lizard, Green Goddess etc. \n\n**Sunscreen Filters:** Zinc Oxide (15.2%)\n\n**Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide, Water/Aqua/Eau, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Diheptyl Succinate, C18-21 Alkane, Erythritol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Propanediol, Arachidyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, Coco-Glucoside, Ethyl Ferulate, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Xanthan Gum, Octyldodecyl Oleate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Sodium Hyaluronate, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Maltodextrin, Moringa Oleifera Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492).\n\n**Ingredient Callouts:**  Fragrance free, silicone free, paraben-free, alcohol-free, should be fungal-acne safe (edit: not FA safe :( )\n\nThis is an all-mineral, zinc-oxide only sunscreen. It's tinted with warm undertones, but doesn't seem to provide any sort of coverage. The color on my hand is notably different than my skintone (much warmer, less red) but it blends in very well. I don't get a white cast with this (but I am pale-ish). It doesn't cover any of my redness or give an airbrushed look like some tinted sunscreens do.\n\nTexturally, this feels somewhat like a gel moisturizer. It's silicone free so it feels fairly light on the skin once it's on. I hate the suffocating feeling of some of the high-silicone mineral sunscreens out there. The spread on this is impressive and I don't have a problem using the recommended amount and getting it to look nice. The finish is dewy/natural. It's definitely shiny at first, but tones down to look natural/hydrated. I don't find that it settles into any creases or leaves my skin too dry at the end of the day. This might move around on you if you have oily skin. I haven't had any skin irritation from using it for the past week, but will update this if I get any.\n\nThe packing of this is a tube with a twist off lid. It's pretty easy to use and made of mostly post-consumer material, which is cool. I have no complaints with the packaging other than wishing that the product was sold in a larger size (this won't last long). \n\nOne negative: the smell is sort of chemically/gross. It doesn't smell like sunscreen per say, but there's a sort of irony, weird smell to it when you first put it on. It does dissipate pretty quickly, but if you're scent-sensitive it's something to keep in mind. There's no fragrance in it at all.\n\nIn terms of sun protection: I'd rather see a higher SPF, but this performs adequately for me when I go for walks. I haven't had any burning or increases in hyper pigmentation or flares of my rosacea since I've been using it. \n\nI'd say this is a good option for anyone looking for a silicone-free zinc-oxide only mineral sunscreen. I think it would perform best for people with dry/normal skin. It seems to be protective, the texture is nice, and it doesn't leave a noticeable whitecast, greasiness, or chalkiness. It's not waterproof, but holds on during my walks if I get sweaty. Overall, I'm fairly impressed and likely will repurchase this!",

Mineral ones were the best, but I still reacted to some, and they sometimes dried out my skin after repeated wear.\n\nI already knew my skin reacted to benzoic acid and sodium benzoate. So then I started to wonder, if it's possible I'm reacting to Uvinul A Plus. \n\nEdit: I thought it may be due to its benzoic acid structure, although commenter below pointed out this is not likely the case, since the filters in my sunscreen also have a similar structure. \n\nI found a sunscreen without: benzoic acid, sodium benzoate (used as preservatives), alkyl benzoates (solvents, emolients) and diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (uvinul A plus) and - hey presto! I can finally wear sunscreen daily. OH MY GOD. \n\nWhat's funnier is that the sunscreens contain some old gen filters everyone hates and calls irritating: Boots Mattifying SPF50+ Fluid: *Aqua (Water), Octocrylene, Dibutyl adipate, Propanediol, Silica, Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl salicylate, Phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, Cellulose, Ethylhexyl triazone, Cetearyl alcohol, Dicaprylyl carbonate, Aminomethyl propanol, Niacinamide, Caprylyl glycol, Sodium stearoyl glutamate, Tocopheryl acetate, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic acid, Glycerin, Xanthan gum, Disodium EDTA*\n\nPosting as an FIY, I think it's interesting, and there may be others with a similar sensitivity. I am of course not saying Uvinaul A Plus is bad or harmful, this is just what my body decided to freak out about...\n\nEdit: I’m also still not 100% sure if alkyl benzoates are an issue, but it’s something I’ll keep testing. \n\nBut also we need to stop calling new-gen filters universally non-irritating and old filters bad bad, as that will not be the case for everybody.\n\nI'm so happy I wanted to share! But also, if you happen to know of any other formulas that fit these requirements, please let me know. If my sunscreen ever gets discontinued, I'll be left in a sea of almost identical formulas I cannot use again 🙏\n\nEdit: post edited following discussion below. ",

I can finally wear sunscreen daily. OH MY GOD.\n\nAccording to the ingredients list you posted, no you didn't. Just because \"benzo\" isn't featured in the INCI nomenclature for the compound does not mean the molecule doesn't have a benzene ring attached to a carboxylic acid group (what makes something \"benzoic\"). Maybe look up the chemical structure to make sure before that your \"theory\" makes sense before posting and potentially misinforming others.\n\nI mean the second UV filter in the sunscreen that works for you is *Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane* aka [Avobenzone](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Avobenzone#section=Depositor-Supplied-Synonyms) has that benzoic structure, followed by *Ethylhexyl salicylate* aka [Octisalate ](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-ethylhexyl%20salicylate#section=2D-Structure)also named \"2-Hydroxy**benzoic acid** 2-ethylhexyl ester\" once again with the bezoic structure that you can see with your own 2 eyes, then *Ethylhexyl triazone* aka [Uvinul T150 ](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ethylhexyl-triazone)even have 3 of those benzoic structures and is literally also called \"**Benzoic acid,** 4,4',4''-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyltriimino)tris-,1,1',1''-tris(2-ethylhexyl) ester\". The formula your skin is fine with, contains bezoic acid esters, so that's not that.\n\nI have no doubt you have been experiencing bad reactions from suncreens, as someone with rosacea and very sensitive skin I fully empathize with the struggle of finding one you can tolerate. And that may very well be because of a specific sensitivity/allergy you have to Uvinul A Plus, it also could be any of the other common ingredients found in those sunscreens, unless you get tested to confirm we can't be sure.\n\nI agree it's not as simple as *\"old gen filters = bad, new gen filters = perfect\",* I also don't think most people believe that. Anyone can develop an allergy or react badly to anything, that doesn't negates the fact that the data we have at the moment shows that those newer filters are \"better tolerated\" meaning they are statistically less likely to cause irritations within the population compared to their older counterparts. It doesn't mean 1 individual can't somehow react badly to a specific new one but tolerate specific old ones well: sensitization do be weird like that.\n\nedit: spelling",

At first, its was wonderful, felt super nice in my hair and for the first time in my life, my frizziness was gone just after using the shampoo and conditioner.\n\nI thought I'd found a shampoo that was perfect for my hair finally, but just recently, it hasn't been so great. For the first 2 weeks, all my frizziness was completely gone, but it seems it comes back more and more with each wash, and I've been getting little tiny flakes of either dandruff or product buildup. I always make sure to scrub my scalp with the pads of my fingers and work the lather down, and the conditioner absorbs so well  into my strands that there's barely anything to wash out after waiting a couple minutes. On top of that, my hair has been getting greasy on my second day, which never happened on any shampoo I've ever used (Suave, Tresseme, RegisDesignline, Big & Sexy, Paul Mitchell). I don't use any heat products or any other kinds of products to set my hair, so I don't think that it's because of damage or product buildup, unless it's somehow the shampoo itself. \n\nI'm really at a loss at this point and not sure if I should try a different line within Shea moisture, to give this one a bit more time, or to try a different brand.\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Shampoo**\n\nWater (Aqua), Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycol Stearate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Trichilia Emetica Seed Butter, Ficus Carica (Fig) Extract, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearamide AMP, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Honey\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Conditioner**\n\nWater (Aqua), Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyropermum Parkii (Shea) Butter *, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Trichliav Emetica Seed Butter, Behentrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Cellulose, Glycerin (Vegetable), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Ether, Honey, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) Tocopherol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG Propyl Silanrtriol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ficus (Fig) Extract",

It smelled SO lovely and it had been recommended to me by my sister who has defined ringlets so I thought I'd give it a go. I have 2c hair and oh man this stuff was a disaster for me. The top of my scalp was always so so waxy. Yes, I do mean waxy, not greasy. It had turned the hair on the top of my scalp into a straight (no longer wavy) waxy mess. I was full of dandruff, my head was also itchy (which made the dandruff even worse, and god I mean it was *insane* how itchy I was!!!) so I figured I should use more shampoo and really get it sudsing to wash it out. It made my situation worse. I was not using any product in my hair and going to work on the daily so it was always in a bun and I let it air dry almost every night, I was treating it right so I couldn't understand wtf was happening. \nAbout that time I decided I needed a hair cut and apologized in advance to the hair stylist and told her my woes (I'd never seen her before) and once I told her I was using this line of shampoo and conditioner she told me immediately to stop using it. The shampoo I had been using was full of too many oils and I wasn't clarifying my hair in any way. I was kinda drowning my hair in oil. The conditioner didn't really help much either. \nI haven't used their products since cause I was so upset from what it did to me. I know I used a different shampoo but there's something about this line that could never groove with my hair. I stole a pump from my sister's styling cream and it gave me a headache all day from the scent and my hair didn't take to it, either. \nI tossed my bottles in the end. You could try another one of their products that may actually wash your hair better and you can avoid all the dandruff but my experience has been bad with this line.",

    "body": "I’m From Mugwort Cream\n\nThe mugwort line from I’m From features some of my favorite soothing/calming products. Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gej52o8uhrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69c33d2c3502651329ebd0b47e18a465bf9de2d1",

    "body": "• There aren’t that many reviews of products by Bonajour online so I decided to make a review post. All of the products were purchased from Amazon through the official Bonajour seller. \n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\n1.) Coconut Oil Body Moisturizer (300 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Olivate, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Saussurea Involucrata Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Olivoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Glyceryl Oleate, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Arginine, Carbomer, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n- Review: I’ve repurchased this body lotion multiple times already. The scent is so heavenly and it feels so good on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight but moisturizing. 5/5\n\n2.) Sensitive Skin Body Wash (500 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Disodium cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Propanediol, Sodium cocoyl glutamate, Sodium chloride, Glycerin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aniba Rosodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Octyldodecanol, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene glycol\n\n- Review: I love this body wash, I’ve purchased it 2 times and it lasts for a while too (even with daily use). It has a relaxing smell and it lathers well. I put this body wash on a Salux washcloth and the body wash doesn’t dry out my skin. 5/5\n\n3.) Mugwort Cream Calming Mask (1.9 fl. oz)\n\n- Ingredients: Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract(32.20%), Water, Kaolin, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bentonite, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery)Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Brassica Rapa (Turnip) Leaf Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Brassica OleraceaItalica (Broccoli) Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pusatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Citrusparadisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Octyldodecanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Oleanolic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (4,000ppm), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil(500ppm), Sod\n\n- Review: I’m still going through my first purchase of this and it’s grown on me. Although I prefer the I’m From Mugwort Mask, this mask is skin calming too. I use mask this during my menstruation cycle (where my skin is more prone to having skin inflammation) and it felt very nice. I also like how the date when opened can be written on the product + it’s a cheaper mugwort product. 4/5\n\n4.) Propolis Serum (100 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Propolis Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Ulmus Campestris (Elm) Bark Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Gleditsia Australis Thorn Extract, Angelica Dahurica Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Bletilla Striata Root Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Extract, Trichosanthes Kirilowii Root Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Amomum Xanthioides Seed Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Sodium Carbomer, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Epigallocatechin Gallate\n\n- Review: I have mixed thoughts about this product. The price is really good especially for the size (100 ML). I would recommend this serum for oily skin types. This is more of a skin calming serum rather than a hydrating one. It did calm my face but did little for my acne. This product is also unscented. I didn’t repurchase the serum. 3/5 \n\n5.) Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

    "body": "Recently I saw someone here recommend a face sunscreen from Lidl. For 3€ I decided to try it myself. I have to mention that I bought it with intention to use on my hands and neckline, not on my face, to carry it with me when I go out. \n\nIt works great on my hands because it’s lightweight and very pleasant, I don’t have to worry about leaving marks with greasy hands lol. I noticed it forms a nice water-resistant barrier until I wash my hands with soap and it’s time to reapply. \nActually it is so surprisingly pleasant to use I can totally see myself using it on my face in case for whatever reason I don’t have my usual sunscreen with me or have to top up. In that regard I could recommend picking it up. But…\n\nI don’t know a lot about filters, but I imagine there are no miracle products for 3€ and from what I can see there are some basic common chemical filters. Which is fine.\nWhat I am confused about is that on the back of the packaging there is an instruction to use a minimum of 5 ml of product just for your face. Now that’s a lot compared to general recommendations that I am familiar with and that would make this 50 ml tube enough for 10 uses JUST for the face, and 5 uses for face and neck. Also it would take forever to dry. It’s suddenly not as cheap when you have to use 4x more. However, how would they achieve SPF 50 value stated on the label? I thought brands have to use the same amount for testing. I’m confused and this makes me doubt if it is a good purchase in terms of sun protection value for the price. Unless I misunderstood something. \n\nPlease enlighten me and please share your experiences with this product if you’ve tried it.\n\nI’m also open for any affordable, elegant sunscreen suggestions. Products that are reliable and good for my purpose. German drugstore would be great. \n\nIngredient list:\nAqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Myristyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Potassium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Selerotium Gum, Acacia Senegal Gum",

There is a picture of the supposed black tea leaf at the front.\nThe back packaging has some some of its instructions printed in both Korean and also English with pictures on how to use the mask properly.\nAside fron that, the ingredients were also stated at the back along with the expiration date.\n\nREVIEW:\nIt is a cotton sheet mask and packed without any additional plastic inside. The mask is folded in such a way that you have to be careful when pulling it apart. The fit was okay. The essence is not runny. It claims to moisturize but I didn't feel any, well, maybe slightly but to be honest, I was quite disappointed because I have high hopes for this mask due to its claims.\n\nOVERALL: I was expecting for extra moisture but this mask is just another one of those meh masks that I've ever tried. Although this mask did not break me out but I would still not repurchase this ever again. I rather spend my money on masks that are able to live up to its claim.\n\nRATING: 4/10",

It's not drying, but goes in like water.  You have to factor in.  Looks just like it Missha and is in a glass bottle and clear, but less sticky going in. If I use one on each side, as I have a bit of the Missha left, the results seem the same.  The results are harder to gauge now, as I use so many AB products, my skin is brighter for many reasons.  My husband started it and it does brighten his skin.  I gave him my tiny travel bottle of the old Missha to travel with.  He didn't notice it was different. The Scinic is  more of a SKII dupe as it has galactoymces and like that is a small ingredient list.  However, it only has 60% Pitera, where as SKII has 98%   But with Korean labeling rules it's hard to say what that means. SKII could be petera could be mostly water.  Scinic  does have licorice and niacinamide.  Smells like sake and feels like water and looks like water. Goes in right away.  \n\n\nIngredients:  Galactomyces ferment filtrate, butylene glycol, glycereth-26, niacinamide, pentelene glycol, caprylhydroxamic acid, adenosine, sodium citrate, citric acid, disodium EDTA, glycyrrhiza glaba (licorice) root water, portulaca oleracea extract, rubus coreanus fruit extract, sea water\n",

    "body": "I’m From Mugwort Cream\n\nThe mugwort line from I’m From features some of my favorite soothing/calming products. Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1v2hb1nphrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c1d9c6fc79b1872a8b62a5f86e994978fc3754f",

It doesn’t make my face feel like I think good skin should feel like. \n\nMy face just feels absolutely soothed, moisturized to the deepest levels, and not oily or tacky at all. I also put it around my eyes as they tend to get irritated very easily, and it’s just so so nice. \nMy skin feels so much smoother, neutral and non-irritated, just such a nice feeling. \n\nI won’t make any claims that it’s universally good for everyone’s skin type/condition, but I am just so excited about the effects I’ve gotten from this product and the joy it has brought to find something that just works so well for me. \n\nAnyway, if anyone else has tried this product or any other products from the range - please share your experiences and recommendations! ❤️ \n\n",

    "body": "So I was hesitant to review this product as I don't want to be unfair since as we all know, YMMV with skincare products. But I've decided I think it's worth sharing my (very bad) experience....\n\nThis product is marketed as a gentle retinol alternative since it uses bakuchiol. I was excited to try this product because I had wanted to stop using tretinoin and was curious if bakuchiol would show any effects like regular retinol. I am an experienced retinoid user, have used retinoids for over a decade and I have used tretinoin for a couple years now. I'm also experienced with exfoliation in general, I've even used strong AHA/BHA peels like Sukari Baby Facial or the Ordinary Peeling solution. Never had any problems. I don't have sensitive skin and before this product I had never had a reaction to a product before.\n\nOf course, because we all do stupid things sometimes, since I have never had a bad reaction to a product and I'm used to retinoids that are stronger than bakuchiol, I didn't patch test. My fault (learn from my mistakes)! This is also an overnight mask, so I literally wore it allllll night long. When I woke up, I remember feeling like everything was unusually blurrier than normal. I looked in the mirror, and realized my face was COMPLETELY swollen, things seemed blurry cuz my eyes were swollen. My face was also VERY RED and burned, it even felt hot to the touch.\n\nSince I'm used to peels and retinoids, I must have had some sort of allergic reaction to something in the mask. At first I wondered if it was the bakuchiol, but I have since tried a bunch of other bakuchiol products with zero issue.\n\nAt first, I didn't want to review this product since I might just have a weird uncommon allergy and so it's not the products fault. But then I started looking at other people's reviews on Ulta, and what is really strange is that even though a lot of people LOVE this product, if you look at the 1 star reviews most of them had the same experience as me, redness, burning, swelling. I find that really concerning that this kind of reaction is as common as it is. And especially for an overnight product marketed as \"gentle\" and claims it \"calms the look of inflammation.\"\n\nSomething else I find really interesting, I was investigating this and found a review from Dr. Dray of a different product from Cocokind, the Texture Smoothing Cream, and she also had a bad reaction and turned very red. Her assumption is that it was from the peppermint extract in the cream since she is notoriously against fragrance ingredients. I noticed that there are a few ingredients common between both products, all of which I know for a fact are common in other products I use, except for cucumber extract and the preservative caprylhydroxamic acid. I'm not allergic to cucumber, but interestingly I found this paper in the Contact Dermatitis journal: [An epidemic of allergic contact dermatitis caused by a new allergen, caprylhydroxamic acid, in moisturizers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cod.12787). So maybe it's that? I noticed the products Dr. Dray reviewed  from Cocokind that did not give her a reaction do not have this preservative in it, except for the sunscreen. I read in [safety data sheet](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/Caprylhydroxamic%20Acid_3.pdf) that they believe  the allergy potential of this preservative is related to the use of penetration enhancers. My guess is in a sunscreen they don't need penetration enhancers since it's not the primary purpose of a sunscreen to deliver ingredients deeper into the skin?\n\nSo **TLDR**, it seems to me that moderately severe reactions are more common than they should be for a couple of Cocokind's products, possibly due to the preservative caprylhydroxamic acid?",

Love this as an everyday shampoo, very mild fruity scent. Not sure about the volumizing, but cleans well for a sulfate-free shampoo.\n\nWella Invigo Sensitive Mask\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Betaine, Panthenol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Valine, Methylparaben, Allantoin, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\nLove this hair mask, one of the very few that I’ve found that’s fungal acne safe. I can use it close to my scalp without an uncomfortable feeling.\n\nI haven’t found a great conditioner. Right now I use The Ordinary’s conditioner, which is very basic but at least detangles my knotty hair. Does contain cetearyl alcohol.\n\n\nFace\n\nSkintype: Oily but easily dehydrated, acne-prone\n\nAvène Cicalfate+ Purifying Cleansing Gel\n\nAvene Aqua, Aqua, Glycerin, Disodium Coco-Glucoside Citrate, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Pentylene Glycol, Aquaphilus Dolomiae Ferment Filtrate, Arginine, Citric Acid, Copper Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Trisodium, Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Sulfate.\n\nI haven’t seen much written about this cleanser, but I think it’s really good. Mild but cleansing, non-drying for a gel (more of a liquid texture). It’s blue in color due to the copper in it.\n\nDr. Eddie's Happy Cappy Medicated Shampoo\n\nI bit the bullet and ordered this from iHerb (expensive from where I am). It’s really good, I can use it on my face for a couple of minutes and still not get super dry. Calms down the small spots.

I have just noticed that a lot of AB products tend to have more types of peptides but also almost always contain copperpeptides (specifically copper trieptide-1 made them fat/thicc on the ingredient lists).   \nWhy is that?   \ni heard some conflicting things about copper peptides and L-ascorbic acid. It's fine to mix l-ascorbic acid with AB copperpeptide containing products because the amount of copper peptides is too low to cause problems. But if the amount of copperpeptides is too low to cause problems doesn't that mean the copperpeptide is useless in the formula?  \nAnd does it mean the overall concentration of peptides is too low or just the copperpetide(s) (they tend to be close on the ingredientlist).   \nI mean i can see they don't contain a lot of copperpetides since they are not blue-ish like the ordinary copperpeptides serum but still. I am just cofused......  \n\n\nfyi i usually don't worry about concentrations of peptides since the concentrations needed to work are so low but the copperpeptides + l-ascorbic acid made me a bit confused.  \n\n\n\\+  \n\n\nAnybody know what all the sh-peptides are for in the last one???

Ultimately you'd need to consult with a cosmetic chemist (ie: [LabMuffinBeautyScience](https://www.youtube.com/@LabMuffinBeautyScience)) to understand the relationships because it all ***depends***. \n\nInevitably the question is how much do you trust the brand, because it is not in their best interest to spend time and money on research and development of formulations or sourcing/buying/incorporating ingredients that don't work or cause problems. \n\nCopper peptides are short chains of amino acids that can help maintain skin structure by boosting collagen and elastin production. When applied topically, copper peptides can act as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and can help soften the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Copper peptides can also help treat scarring, pigmentation, and redness caused by inflammation.\n\nAccording to a board-certified dermatologist, copper peptides are a type of peptide that acts as a messenger to instruct skin cells to perform various functions, such as building collagen and elastin, reducing inflammation, and maintaining hydration.\n\nCopper can oxidize ascorbic acid (vitamin C), causing it to break down too rapidly and resulting in diminished benefits. However, some recommend using copper peptides with vitamin C, as peptides work synergistically with vitamin C to trap moisture and improve the skin's texture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Different strengths of copper can oxidize ascorbic acid, which diminishes the effectiveness of vitamin C\n* Peptides work synergistically with vitamin C to trap moisture and improve skin texture  \nTo achieve maximum benefits, you should use copper peptides consistently for at least 3 months.\n\n**From Board Certified Dermatologists:**\n\n**The Incredible Case For Copper Peptides (& ascorbic acid)**\n\n>[Video from dermatologist](https://youtu.be/lJQJ3i8KCnU)\n\n**What are Copper Peptides?** \n\n>[Video from dermatologist](https://youtu.be/iGAdOBnu3AU)\n\n**INCI Decoder**\n\n>Decode skincare ingredients fast with our science-based but easy-to-understand explanations.

In my honest opinion that sounds like a lot especially if you suspect your moisture barrier is already damaged. I have used a lot of topicals prescribed and they either made no difference or made my skin dry and worse (not to scare you, treatments work for a lot of people) but I suspected the real issue with my skin was my moisture barrier and started using a good moisturizer with a layer of aquaphor every day and my rosacea has pretty much resolved with just that. I would say if you are going to try all of that out make sure you have a really good moisturizer because it is likely going to dry your skin out, or maybe try to introduce them one at a time and give your skin a little time to get used to them!",

It's quite plain for a character mask but at least the brand's name was printed down below.\nYou can find some more information at the back where the upper half is mostly in korean language while the lower part is in English.\nThe expiration date can also be found at the bottom, though you have to really squint your eyes to get a better view on it.\nOh, and it's also difficult to tear the packaging.\n\nREVIEW:\nWhen I first tore the packaging, the scent immediately hit my nose. The mask obviously smells like fresh apple. So yummy up until the point that I wanted to eat it.\nThe sides of my face have a nice fit, except for the eye area which I found it to be quite big for my eyes.\nThe sheet mask doesn’t fall off from my face.\nThe essence leaves a sticky residue so I won't recommend this for morning usage as the essence does take a while for it to fully soak into the skin and thus this will affect the application of your makeup.\nAfter patting the remaining essence onto my skin, my face immediately feels more hydrated and more plumper and I kept on touching it non-stop.\nHowever, the effect only lasted for a day.\n\nOVERALL:\nHm, not bad for a face mask. I wouldn't repurchase it because there are about billions of masks to try and this mask is not that great, to be honest.\n\nRATING:\n5/10\n\nHave you guys tried any of the character mask from The Face Shop?",

I also took them right when I woke up so excuse any less than stellar focusing/editing.\n\n[Bottles bottles bottles!](http://imageshack.com/a/img910/4102/mVzP1C.jpg) ~**~ [Masks!](http://imageshack.com/a/img901/9827/B78rFB.jpg) ~**~ [Skylake Bae Sample Heaven cont.](http://imageshack.com/a/img661/2466/UkDTBZ.jpg)\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe second I saw Skylake opened their English webshop, I hit that place up like a frenzied vulture.  I basically became obsessed after the Mishibox shampoo sample, because I've never had a shampoo work so perfectly for my hair (long, oily scalp) - and I've tried nearly every store brand Target carries, salon brands, organic brands, sulfate frees, etc.  I ran out and was unhappily using Biosilk until my fresh bottle arrived, and lord am I relieved.  \n\nI bought the shampoo, a box of their Elastic/Pore sheet masks, 1 ea. of their Brightening and Relaxing/Trouble Care masks, and a mini Oriental Herbal Relax Toner.  The rest is all samples from the gracious Skylake gods above, they did not mess around for their opening event.  I somehow managed to miss the face powder priceline by like 3 dollars since I didn't pay attention, but I received one anyway!  The best pity.  Samples include:\n\nOriental Herb Hosu Aqua Gel, Oriental Herb Hosu Aqua Skin, Elastic/Brightening soap, Natural Foam Cleanser, Refresh Cleansing & Massage Cream, Oriental Herb Natural Sun Screen SPF50 PA+++, Oriental Herb Lotion & Cream, Green Energy Essence, Natural Multi Blemish Balm SPF36 PA++\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSo, naturally, I tried some of the samples and the face powder the other day/last night.  My face lately looks like I'm peeling from the devil's sunburn because of tretinoin, no amount of moisturizing layers have been helping me during the day or night, so I honestly figured \"WHAT ELSE COULD GO WRONG\" and just dove right in.  Idiot girl continues to not patch test mass amounts of items, what happens next will shock you.\n\n*My face this morning was actually not bad*.  Consider me hella pleased to see my flaking was minimal, and I actually still looked moisturized to an extent.  If this is just a fluke, I'm still okay with it.  If this is the power of those Hosu samples, I am going to need full sizes.  And on that note, some impressions for items!\n\n------------------------\n\n**ORIENTAL HERB CLEANSING POWDER (blue)**\n\n*cnidium officinale root powder, glutinous rice powder, sodium carbonate, phaseolus angularis seed powder, phaseolus radiatus seed powder, sodium laurate, sodium stearate, sodium myristrate, sodium palmate*\n\nThis powder when mixed with water, for me, tested at a pH of 7.  I tested it a couple of times to be sure, but it definitely reads differently than my DHC powder, so I'm confident that is accurate enough.  However, last night I threw all caution to the tretinoin wind and used it anyway - it's not bad!  It doesn't feel like your skin is taut and dry after, but extended use will need to be tested.\n\nIn the bottle, it smells like an earthy green tea, and it looks like it too.  When in use though, it smells like some baked you a fresh stack of waffles and then went, \"you know what would be delicious on this? Mushrooms.\"  Surprisingly, it is not a bad combo.  In fact, I would rank it as one of my favorite product smells in a while.  The powder is slightly gritty and doesn't entirely dissolve, but it's not scratchy.\n\n~~\n**HERBAL COOL SHAMPOO**\n\n*SKYLAKE oriental herb water (water, angelica gigas extract, peppermint leaf extract, artemisia absinthum extract, morus alba leaf extract,cnidium officinale root extract, licorice root extract, morus alba barf extract, angelica dahurica root extract, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, inula helenium extract, laminaria japonica extract, phellodendron amurense bark extract, clove flower extract), disodium cocoamphodiacetate, cocamidopropyl betaine, tea-cocoyl glutamate, disodiumlaureth sulfosuccinate, glycerin, cocamidedea, peg-12 dimethicone, amodimethicone, polygonatum multiflorum, polyqua ternium-7, scutellaria baicalensis root powder, polyquatemlum-10, peppermint leaf oil, menthol, phellodendron ammurense bark, allantoin, panthenol, caprylhydroxamic acid / caprylyl glycol / glycerin, salicylic acid, citric acid, disodium edta, rhizome/root*\n\nI just really love this shampoo and have a lot of feelings about it.\n\n~~\n**ORIENTAL HERB HOSU AQUA SKIN & GEL**\n\nThe skin is super watery and pours out of the sample bottle like the wind, so be careful.  The gel is thin and refreshing.  Both have this smell that is so familiar, but I can't put my finger on it.  It's not a disagreeable smell and it dissipates fairly quickly.  I am super duper impressed by the moisture I got from these samples, and they are both lightweight and breathable.  This seem like ideal items for hot and humid climates, and rough summers.\n\n~~\n**ELASTIC/PORE MASK SHEETS**\n\n*SKYLAKE oriental herb water (water, angelica gigas extract, peppermint leaf extract, artemisia absinthum extract, morus alba leaf extract,cnidium officinale root extract, licorice root extract, morus alba barf extract, angelica dahurica root extract, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, inula helenium extract, laminaria japonica extract, phellodendron amurense bark extract, clove flower extract), carbomer 981, sodium polyacrylate, disodium edta, allantoin, glycerin, propylene glycol, hmamelis virgiana (witch hazel) water, 1.3bg, polysorbate 80, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, paeonia suffruticosa root extract, glycerin, butylene glycol, betaine, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, sodium pca, triethanolamine, sodium hyaluronate 1%, natto gum, collagen, portulaca oleracea extract, aloe barbadensis leaf extract*\n\nI haven't tried one yet, but I figured some people might want the ingredients.  I am going to slap one on my face before work though.\n\n~~\n**Oriental Herb Relax Toner**\n\nThis stuff smells like acidy dirt, I don't even know what to tell you.  It's kind of bizarre.  It's wet. I will probably still use it on my face because it's pocket convenient.",

        "body": "From the ingredients list, I would actually say its neither, in the sense that it's not a true exfoliant. It's actually a \"peeling gel\" or similar product, that sort of balls up on your skin, and give little white balls. These kinds of peeling gels in general don't actually do very much in the way of exfoliation. I've [reviewed one such example a few years back](http://musicalhouses.blogspot.com/2012/07/cure-natural-aqua-gel-and-skin.html), and although I didn't note the ingredients list at the time, basically the product (as with most other peeling gels) is formulated mostly with water and film formers and polymers. There aren't any chemical or physical exfoliants in the product, which would give you an exfoliating effect. What happens when you use the product is that the polymers and film formers form a film on your skin, and this film balls up when rubbed into the little white balls you see that come off. The white balls also take some of your skin along with it, so the white balls are mostly product and some skin, and as a result, exfoliation is really very gentle, even if it is a bit minimal. But people see the white balls, think it is all skin, and get excited about its exfoliating effect. If your peeling gels ingredients is mostly water and polymers with no physical or chemical exfoliants, chances are it works the same way. Ultimately to get a good exfoliating effect you need either a physical exfoliant (like jojoba beads) or a chemical exfoliant (like acids), and these peeling gels tend to contain neither.",

    "body": "Heyyy, first time poster here but longtime lurker!  So...I should have known better...BUT I added multiple products into my routine and now I don't know which one is breaking me out :(\n\nLittle info: I *think* I have combo skin but not totally sure.  My skin is never super dry or super oily.  But very acne prone in my T-zone (and sometimes a little oily) and then sometimes I have dry patches on my cheeks and around my nostrils.\n\nOk, anyway, so these are the products I've recently added:\n\nThe first is **IT Cosmetic's \"Your Skin but Better\" CC cream (SPF 50)**.  I bought this 3 days ago; I have used it 4 times.  I absolutely fell in love with it right away.  Perfect color match, love the coverage, and that it has SPF.\n\n\nHere is the ingredients list:\n\n\n*Water, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Magnesium Sulfate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Laurate, Stearic Acid, Calcium Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium Edta, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Niacinamide, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Cholesterol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Water, Lactobacillus/Honeysuckle Flower/Licorice Root/Morus Alba Root/Pueraria Lobata Root/Schizandra Chinensis Fruit/Scutellaria Baicalensis Root/Sophora Japonica Flower Extract Ferment Filtrate, Perfluorohexane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chrysanthemum Indicum Flower Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Perfluorodecalin, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sprout Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Pentafluoropropane, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Steareth-20, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Colloidal Oatmeal, Hydrolyzed Silk, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Tocopherol, Thiamine Hcl, Riboflavin, Retinyl Palmitate, Pantothenic Acid, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Niacin, Folic Acid, Chrysin, Carnitine Hcl, Biotin, Ascorbic Acid, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Chlorhexidine Digluconate. May Contain: Iron Oxides (Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499).*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next new product is **Jack Black Epic Moisture MP10 Nourishing Oil**  I've used a sample of this twice now.  2 days ago, I used my DE Babyfacial, which I also recently bought but I've used several samples of this before so I know it's not the culprit.  I do know, however, that the DE Marula Oil that they give you with the babyfacial *does* break me out so I didn't use it after the facial, like they suggest.  Instead, I grabbed the Jack Black sample and I loved it so much! It sunk in right away and just felt so good.  I did this at night then went to bed.  I then used it a second time, yesterday, during the day. BTW, yesterday is the day I noticed my break out.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate, Jojoba Esters, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Citrillus Ianatus (Watemelon) Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Prunus Insititia Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Fragrance (Parfum), Ascorbyl Palmitate, Retinyl Palmitate, Schinziophyton Rautanenii (Manketti) Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Citral, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third product I added is **Marc Jacob's Dew Drops Coconut Gel Highlighter**  I've only used this twice.  I wasn't a big fan.  \n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, Mica, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Tromethamine, Parfum/Fragrance, Lecithin, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Dimethiconol, Simethicone, Hexylene Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta, Tocopherol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Diisostearyl Malate, Butylene Glycol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Panthenol, Withania Somnifera Root Extract, Silica, Isostearyl Alcohol, Malic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Tin Oxide, Coumarin, Linalool, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491), Carmine (Ci 75470).*\n\n\n\nSooo, obviously I'm hoping that the MJ Highlighter is the culprit, since it's the most expensive and my least favorite. But, I have a feeling it's one of the first two :(\n\n\nIf you need any additional info, let me know! I'd love to figure out what it is that caused the breakout so I can continue to use the other products that don't break me out.",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

    "body": "Last week I went on a 3-day outdoorsy trip. For the trip, I dug out one of my rarely used \"for outdoor/sporty/non-socializing use only\" mineral sunscreens. It was **Cotz Sensitive SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen**.\n\nI chose it because a year or two ago, I had successfully used the Cotz SPF 35 Lightly Tinted (also all-mineral actives) on a week-long casual trip, with no resulting reactions in my very sensitive, quickly-reactive facial skin.\n\nSo, for this new trip, I decided to use the SPF 40 before it expired.\n\nAround two days after my return from the trip and to my usual SS, I developed three large, painful, pustule \"acne\" lesions that fit all my criteria for \"product-induced/allergically-triggered.\"\n\nAfter careful analysis and cross-referencing with my personal ingredient spreadsheets and approved-product lists spanning the last 10+ years, I have a reasonable suspicion that \\*\\*Caprylhydroxamic Acid \\*\\*\\*as the second ingredient\\* listed in the formula is the sensitizing culprit.\n\nAdditional note: comparing the SPF 35 Lightly Tinted with the SPF 40 Sensitive Mineral, not only does the former have a laudably short ingredient list but it is, notably, free of Caprylhydroxamic Acid.\n\nInterestingly, though, a basic Google search does not turn up much discussion at all about this ingredient.\n\nI found these two papers from 2020 and 2017:\n\nPaper #1\n\n>*The Panel was concerned with inconsistent outcomes regarding dermal sensitization.  Upon further review, the Panel determined that studies that had positive sensitization results were those in which the test substance included a penetration enhancer.  Additionally, the Panel noted that cases of increased sensitization with use of a moisturizer in Finland, that had been reformulated to include Caprylhydroxamic Acid, appeared to be related to use on damaged skin, and most likely resulted in increased penetration.  Therefore, the Panel stated that caution should be taken with use of Caprylhydroxamic Acid in a manner that would result in increased penetration, such as with the inclusion of  penetration enhancers in formulations containing Caprylhydroxamic Acid.*\n\n>\n\n\\- Safety Assessment of Caprylhydroxamic Acid as Used in Cosmetics (2020), Cosmetic Ingredient Review\n\n[https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/Caprylhydroxamic%20Acid\\_3.pdf](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/Caprylhydroxamic%20Acid_3.pdf)\n\nPaper #2\n\n>\n\n>***Conclusions:*** *We found a new contact allergen, caprylhydroxyamic acid, which caused an epidemic of allergic contact dermatitis in patients using moisturizers containing this preservative. Whether the sensitizing capacity of caprylhydroxamic acid depends on the other chemicals used in Apobase® moisturizers needs further investigation.*\n\n\\- An epidemic of allergic contact dermatitis caused by a new allergen, caprylhydroxamic acid, in moisturizers, 2017 Sep;77(3):159-162. doi: 10.1111/cod.12787. Epub 2017 Apr 19.\n\nI also found this Reddit thread from \"8 years ago\" that cites the second paper above : [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/6mzb6t/research\\_an\\_epidemic\\_of\\_allergic\\_contact/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/6mzb6t/research_an_epidemic_of_allergic_contact/)\n\nAlso interestingly, a search of this ingredient on [incidecoder.com](http://incidecoder.com) returned a list of results in which similar brands to Cotz (i.e. small to mid-size, \"natural\" marketing-oriented, etc.) were over-represented among those that used  Caprylhydroxamic Acid in \\*face\\* products.\n\n**TLDR: I have reasonable basis (personal experience with ingredient-isolation) to conclude that three consecutive days' liberal use of a sunscreen with  Caprylhydroxamic Acid as the second-from-the-top ingredient caused my facial skin to react with large red lesions. There is also some, but not much, information online about this ingredient and its potential for triggering sensitive reactions. Do you have information about or experience with it?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apv7ii6e4lye1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9eceae1ef2372d1454acb39e2a5ea4b0188e40f",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This product, certified by the EWG, is primarily composed of safe ingredients. It contains three ingredients of moderate hazard, but these typically only cause minor issues rather than severe problems. Importantly, instead of using chemical sunscreens such as Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, Homosalate, or Octinoxate, they have used the mineral sunscreen Zinc oxide.

Its role is to improve the texture and feel of the product, help mix oil and water-based ingredients, and enhance the product's stability. In general, Arachidyl Glucoside is considered to be gentle and safe for use in personal care products. However, like any ingredient, it has the potential to cause side effects in some individuals.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some individuals, especially those with sensitive skin, might experience minor skin irritation like redness or itching.\n      * Allergic Reactions: It's uncommon, but some people might have an allergic reaction to Arachidyl Glucoside, leading to symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Butyloctyl Salicylate\n   * Butyloctyl Salicylate is a chemical compound often used in sunscreens and other cosmetic products for its ability to enhance the product's spreadability, increase the skin absorption of other ingredients, and offer some UV radiation protection. While Butyloctyl Salicylate is generally considered safe for topical use, like any ingredient, it could potentially cause side effects in some individuals.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: This compound may cause skin irritation in some individuals, especially those with sensitive skin. Symptoms may include redness, itching, or rash. Babies have more delicate skin than adults and may be more prone to such reactions.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Some people may experience an allergic reaction to Butyloctyl Salicylate, leading to symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing. However, this is less common.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

I've been there.\n\nLe produit qui a sauvé ma peau - et continue de la sauver - c'est le Sérum Apaisant et Protecteur de la Barrière Cutanée, de The Ordinary.\nEt l'autre produit qui sauve ma peau, c'est le dioxyde de titane haha. Cet actif a la réputation d'être apaisant, en ce qui me concerne aucun actif n'apaise aussi bien ma rosacée que le dioxyde de titane. Mais chaque peau est différente, il y a des produits pour peaux sensibles que ma peau n'aime pas alors que tout le monde les adore. Donc il est aussi possible que ta peau n'aime tout simplement pas le dioxyde de titane.\n\nUne crème solaire que ma rosacée adore c'est Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun SPF 50, de la marque coréenne Skin 1004, elle n'a pas de dioxyde de titane et est notée 100/100 sur Yuka. Et la prochaine que j'essaierai sera leur crème solaire Madagascar Centella Tea-Trica Soothing Sun, j'en ai lu du bien pour les peaux sensibles, elle n'a pas de dioxyde de titane non plus.\n\nPour le fond de teint ma peau adore Kiko et Tir Tir (une marque coréenne).\n\nBon courage, laisse-nous savoir si jamais quelque chose marche pour toi!",

    "body": "Hello guys. I have low prosoity hair but in some way the STRENGTHEN & RESTORE TREATMENT MASQUE from Shea Moisture was a miracle for me. My hair is not good in elasticity at all and I know that an increase of moisture should be the solution of this problem  (I've already tried with the Manuka Honey one and some deeply moisturizing mielle products) but for me it was the opposite. I've never used any protein for year but now if I don't use them my hair lacks of elasticity, they tangles a lot and seems very dry, thin and lifeless. So, since I used this deep conditioning mask for almost 2 months now (1x week), all this troubles disappeared.  \n\n\nTalking about the mask itself, I have used this one (from iHerb):  \n\\->  **SheaMoisture, Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque, 12 oz (340 g)**   \n( Water, cetearyl alcohol, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, glycerin (vegetable), butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter\\*♥, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium methosulfate, fragrance, behentrimonium chloride, panthenol, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed wheat starch, cetrimonium chloride, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, mangifera indica (mango) seed butter, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) leaf extract, mauritia flexuosa (buriti) fruit oil, yeast extract, hydrolyzed keratin, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, tocopherol, niacin, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, acetic acid (apple cider), hydrogenated vegetable oil, glycine soja (soybean) oil, trifolium pratense (clover) flower extract, caramel, triethyl citrate, caprylyl glycol, benzoic acid.)  \n\n\nBut now I see two version of the formula in different stores, the \"second\" one is easier to find than the one that I used. Which should I buy? I think that if this first one worked for me, I should stick with it, but the other one is more common in stores. \n\nThis is the formula of the second one that I found (from LookFantastic but I think the same formula from Boots too):  \n\\->  (Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter\\* \\*\\*, Stearyl Alcohol, Parfum, Panthenol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Olea Europaea Husk Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Yeast Extract, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Niacinamide, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Trifolium Pratense Flower Extract, Caramel, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Acetum, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextran.)  \n\n\nWhat do you think it is better? Which one should I buy? I heard that Shea Moisture changed formula and people are not happy about it. Maybe the first one is the old formula. What do you think?  \nThanks for reading and for the suggestions already. Have a good day.",

This is the best explanation i could find: \n\n\"MSM to inhibit the release of inflammatory skin chemicals, now combined with the unique patented ingredient 4-t-butylcyclohexanol which short circuits nerve triggered reddening events including reducing the impact of nerve stimuli triggered by diet and hormonal issues. Polyglutamic acid improves the skins tolerance levels by reducing sensory triggering and improving lipid and epidermal structures which normalise skin response to triggers and raises the skin tolerance thresholds.\"\n\nSo in a nutshell it seems like it can elevate certain trigger thresholds which sounds cool.

        "body": "I'm a little confused on how they did that too, tbh :/. My best guess is that the hydroxypropyl starch phosphate thats helping the cetearyl alcohol into the formula. In some cases it functions as a thickener or texture enhancer and in other cases it funxtions as a mild surfactant and emulsifier (it helps stabilize emulsions, and increase viscosity). So both ingredients might be helping each other. \n\nIf this is the case then your 25% cetearyl alcohol and 13% grapeseed oil is far too much. In fact, that's a lot for any formula and you need to bring the cetearyl alcohol down to like 1 to 5% in my opinion. And the grapeseed oil to like 3% max. Looking at the way matcha boost looks, even if you had a propper emulsifier your version would be far too thick.\n\nThat means everything after that should be less than them, but since they are the water soluble ingredients it's up to you yo change it or not. Your distilled water definitely needs to be at least 75% of your formula.\n\nOtherwise, if this isn't the case, their ingredient list isn't making much sense to me.\n\n Hope i could be of help.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that the cetearyl alcohol and colza oil may be there for just some added emolliency. So the main thickener might just be the hydroxypropyl starch phosphate with some help from the cetearyl alcohol. I would still look at my suggestions to see if it helps,a and just do some extra thinking. I have no idea how much hydroxypropyl starch phosphate is needed in the formula so it will really require some testing.",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: I believe this product stands as one of the top baby lotion options available at a reasonable price. It has obtained the EWG's certification for safety compliance, containing only a single moderate hazard ingredient. While there are reports from the EWG associating Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice with potential carcinogenic risks, it's worth noting that most commercial aloe vera products, including skincare and topical applications, utilize the clear gel from within the aloe vera leaf, excluding the outer part containing aloin. Manufacturers typically employ processes that remove aloin to undetectable levels. However, parents who harbor concerns regarding the presence of Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice may opt for alternative products. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua/Eau), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Rhus Verniciflua Peel Wax, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylyl Glycol, Panthenol, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Cellulose Gum, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid.\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\n   * Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice is widely used in skincare products, including baby shampoos, due to its soothing, hydrating, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is generally considered safe for topical use.\n   * However, it's worth noting that certain parts of the aloe vera plant contain a compound called aloin, which has been linked to potential carcinogenic effects when ingested in large amounts. Most commercial aloe vera products, including skincare products and topical applications, are made from the clear gel found inside the aloe vera leaf, not the outer part of the leaf where aloin is found. The process used to prepare aloe vera for commercial use generally removes aloin to non-detectable levels.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Aloe vera is usually soothing, but some individuals may experience skin irritation or allergic reactions, such as redness, rash, burning or itching sensations, especially with frequent use.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Rarely, some individuals may have a more severe allergic reaction to aloe vera. This could result in symptoms like swelling, severe redness, or difficulty breathing.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

    "body": "I haven't seen much posted about this sunscreen, so thought I'd share my thoughts. I've really been impressed by the SVR brand - I absolutely adore Cicavit SPF 50 and thought I'd try the Clairial SPF which targets hyperpigmentation. It contains Uvinul A plus, Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Univul T 150, and Enzulizole. It says that it has a \"5.6% dipigmenting complex\" - I assume coming from the beta-carotene  Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine and carrot extract.\n\nIt is peachy toned out of the bottle and is thick and pasty. The application reminds me a lot of the Canadian Avene Very High Protection SPF 50 with the tinosorbs. Both pill A LOT if you don't apply in very thin layers. It's a lot higher maintenance an application than the Cicavit, which I can slap on and be done with.\n\nThere is also a slight white cast (on my fitzpatrick 4-5 skin). I don't think it would be visible on lighter skin tones and for me, it kind of looks like a \"tone-up\". I think there is something sitting atop the skin (like in a physical sunscreen. If I use a makeup wipe to remove it, the peachy/white tint comes off on the wipe).\n\nThe finish is quite lovely. It dries down to a semi-matte. For my dry/dehyrated skin, I don't need to apply any powder to mattify it.\n\nThere is also a strong fragrance - floral, kind of cloying. The first day I applied this sunscreen, it's all I could smell; however, with repeated applications, it's become fainter to my nose.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty nice sunscreen. Good filters and the cast isn't unbearable. Cicavit is my holy grail winter sunscreen. I'll use up my two bottles of Clairial but unsure if I'll repurchase. I don't have the patience to be super careful in applying it and would prefer something unscented.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull ingredients:\n\nAqua (Purified Water), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Silica, Ceteareth-20, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Propanediol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Aminomethyl Propanol, Arginine, Bentonite, Beta-Carotene, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Cetearyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ci 15850, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Ethylhexyl Ferulate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydrogenated Phosphatidylcholine, Lecithin, Phenethyl Alcohol, Plankton Extract, Diacetyl Boldine, Squalane, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Lysolecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Polysorbate 60, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Xanthan Gum, Parfum (Fragrance)",

I'm worried both for breakouts and for health in general.\n\nIn order to be more accurate, here are the INCIs:\n\nLRP Anthelios Ultra\n\n>AQUA / WATER  \n>  \n>DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE  \n>  \n>GLYCERIN  \n>  \n>BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE  \n>  \n>ALCOHOL DENAT.  \n>  \n>PROPANEDIOL  \n>  \n>ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE  \n>  \n>ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE  \n>  \n>C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER  \n>  \n>DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE  \n>  \n>BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE  \n>  \n>ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE  \n>  \n>SILICA  \n>  \n>TOCOPHEROL  \n>  \n>ISOPROPYL  \n>  \n>LAUROYL SARCOSINATE  \n>  \n>ACRYLATES COPOLYMER  \n>  \n>AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/VP COPOLYMER  \n>  \n>CAPRYLYL GLYCOL  \n>  \n>CITRIC ACID  \n>  \n>DISODIUM EDTA  \n>  \n>SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS EXTRACT / SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS ROOT EXTRACT  \n>  \n>T-BUTYL ALCOHOL  \n>  \n>TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID  \n>  \n>TRIETHANOLAMINE  \n>  \n>XANTHAN GUM\n\nBionike Mat 50+\n\n>aqua (water), diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl triazone, silica, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, dibutyl adipate, 1,5-pentanediol, triacontanyl PVP, titanium dioxide, glycerin, niacinamide, lactobacillus ferment, tocopheryl acetate, sodium carboxymethyl beta-glucan, carnosine, caprylyl glycol, sodium polyacrylate, butyrospermum parkii butter (butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter), potassium cetyl phosphate, ethylhexylglycerin, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, panthenol, PEG-60 almond glycerides, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, oleanolic acid, jojoba esters, sodium hydroxide, caprylhydroxamic acid, pentylene glycol, carbomer, butylene glycol, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate.\n\nBionike Aknet Sun 50+ (This is surely my last option, considering I'm not a fan of dimethicone and considering it has cetearyl alcohol)\n\n>aqua (water), diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, silica, glycerin, butylene glycol, ethylhexyl triazone, triacontanyl PVP, dibutyl adipate, poloxamer 407, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, titanium dioxide, niacinamide, tocopheryl acetate, sodium carboxymethyl beta-glucan, carnosine, caprylyl glycol, butyrospermum parkii butter (butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter), panthenol, allantoin, PEG-60 almond glycerides, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, oleanolic acid, potassium cetyl phosphate, dimethicone, sodium polyacrylate, PPG-12/SMDI copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, jojoba esters, carbomer, pentylene glycol, caprylhydroxamic acid, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I've almost forgotten to mention I'm from Europe, so I cannot access to several US sunscreens",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This product, verified by the EWG, generally does not cause significant problems for children, and can be a good option for many parents. This baby lotion contains mostly beneficial ingredients such as plant oils and extracts which provide moisture and soothe the skin. The inclusion of Avena Sativa Kernel Flour (oatmeal) and Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract can be particularly beneficial for sensitive skin. Tocopheryl Acetate, a form of Vitamin E, provides antioxidant benefits. However, Cetyl Alcohol, though generally mild, can occasionally cause skin irritation in very sensitive individuals. The preservative system with Caprylhydroxamic Acid and Glyceryl Caprylate is gentle and less likely to cause reactions. Xanthan Gum is a safe thickening agent but might cause issues if your baby is allergic. Always do a patch test before using it extensively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Glycerin, Emulsifying Wax, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Avena Sativa Kernel Flour, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Spiraea Ulmaria Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Emulsifying Wax\n   * Emulsifying Wax is a common ingredient in many types of creams and lotions, including baby lotion. It's used to help mix oil and water, creating a smooth, creamy texture. This allows the product to evenly spread and absorb into the skin. Generally, emulsifying wax is considered to be safe for topical use and is not associated with severe side effects. However, like any ingredient, it may cause problems for certain individuals.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some rare cases, emulsifying wax can cause skin irritation. This can result in redness, itchiness, or a slight burning sensation. This is more common in people with sensitive skin.\n      * Allergic Reaction: Though very rare, some individuals might have an allergic reaction to emulsifying wax. This could lead to more severe skin redness, swelling, itchiness, hives, and in the most severe cases, difficulty breathing.\n      * Clogged Pores: Depending on the type of emulsifying wax used and the individual's skin type, there may be a risk of clogged pores, which can lead to breakouts. However, this is less likely with baby lotions, which are typically formulated to be gentle and non-comedogenic.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tocopheryl Acetate\n   * Tocopheryl Acetate, also known as Vitamin E Acetate, is a form of Vitamin E that is often used in skincare products and cosmetics, including baby lotion. It acts as an antioxidant and skin-conditioning agent. While Tocopheryl Acetate is generally considered safe for use in skincare products, some people may experience side effects, particularly if they have sensitive skin or a specific allergy to the ingredient.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience minor skin irritation when using products containing Tocopheryl Acetate. This can manifest as redness, itching, or dryness.\n      * Allergic Reaction: Though it's rare, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to Tocopheryl Acetate. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include severe skin redness, swelling, hives, and in severe cases, difficulty breathing.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product containing Tocopheryl Acetate comes into direct contact with the eyes, it may cause eye irritation.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

I understand that some ingredients might need to be “sealed in” to maximize benefits, but I’m not sure if that’s the case here.\n\nHas anyone else used a ceramide serum as a standalone product? Or is it essential to lock it in with a moisturizer?\n\nI’d appreciate any advice or personal experiences you can share. Thanks a lot!",

I was given a list of some products that were safe to use and finally had my skin almost perfect for the first time in years!  But then a few things happened...\n\n1. My fiance developed a sudden and severe skin allergy to my \"safe\" laundry detergent and we had to switch it immediately.  The laundry detergent he was told to switch to (Tide Gentle & Free Liquid) seemed okay based on ingredients, but was missing from my \"safe list\" and I very obviously reacted to it within a few days.  We agreed to switch to Tide Gentle & Free Powder Detergent (which WAS on the safe list) ASAP but with COVID it took 2 weeks to arrive.  In that time I developed a decently bad rash on my chest and some flair ups in previous problem areas (behind my ears and back of the neck).  They burned to the touch, like my dermatitis rashes tend to.\n2. Switched the detergent, cleaned everything and prepared for the 6 week wait to clear things up.  Nope, it got worse.  Might have been made even worse because I also have a severe tree pollen allergy and started having a bad reaction to my antihistammines, so I stopped taking them (about 2 weeks ago).\n3. It has now been almost 8 weeks and the rash is spreading slowly across my chest and is still on the back of my neck/ear area.  The chest rash is pussy, dense and overall looks horrendous but no longer burns.  I've been moisturizing it daily (google suggested it) and even tried some of the medicated cream my fiance was prescribed as well as over the counter steroid cream - only for a few days, but it didn't seem to help.\n\nIn the last 2 weeks I did change my hair conditioner, as the conditioner on my list that I could get my hands on (I'm in Canada) was terrible and killing my hair.  I very carefully checked the ingredients for any fragrence, essential oils, or any type of \"glucoside\" but I'm wondering if I'm missing another word for some of these chemicals and it might just be making things worse!\n\nThe ingredients are:  Purified Water (Aqua), Brassica alcohol & Brassicamidopropyl dimethylamine & Aspartic acid, Caprylhydroxamic acid & Caprylyl glycol & Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol & Polysorbate 60, Apple Cider Vinegar, Lactic acid, EDDS- Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Melissa Officinalis (Lemon balm) Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\nEspecially with trying to navigate this Covid-19 thing where almost every soap and sanitizer has fragrance, this has been a nightmare. :(  Any advice, especially from those with these allergies would be so so appreciated.\n\n**TLDR: My contact dermatitis rash is not getting better (arguably worse) after 8 weeks and I'm wondering what other names Linalool, Decyl Glucoside, and to a lesser extent Chromium and Gold might hide under in my products.  Also looking for advice on how to help the rash along.**",

I believed the solution was protein, but was skeptical about it since the last time I tried doing something to improve the health of my hair, I damaged it (hence this situation). \n\nAs I was skeptical, I bought a cheap conditioner with protein in it. It has these ingredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, *Silk Amino Acids/Serica/Soíe*, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Glycol Distearate, Glycol Stearate, Isopropyl Alcohol, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Fragrance/Parfum, Red 40/CI 16035, Yellow 5/CI 19140.\n\nI have also tried this mask, but stopped as it has coconut oil in it (what I assume to be the original cause of my fragile hair):\n\nWater, Cetyl Alcohol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Stearyl Alcohol, Fragrance (Parfum), Behentrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, *Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol*, Cetrimonium Chloride, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa Fruit Oil, Yeast Extract, *Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin*, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Niacin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vinegar, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Dextran, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Caramel\n\nBoth of these gave the feeling of coarse, thick hair. It’s going to sound weird but I genuinely can’t remember if this is how my hair once was. But the thing I’m most worried about is once I wash it out and use another conditioner, it’s like those proteins did nothing but give the illusion of thicker hair. Should I keep using products with protein in them? Or are they not helping?\n\nThanks!",

Ask me (I’m the founder) in the comments :)\n\n[Our Approach](https://www.authenticego.com/pages/learn)\n\n\n[Super Sensa Moisturizer](https://www.authenticego.com/collections/all/products/super-sensa-barrier-repair-moisturizer-with-pre-postbiotics)\n\n[Tidy Pores Serum](https://www.authenticego.com/collections/all/products/tidy-pores-serum)\n\n## The Lineup:\n\n## [Super Sensa Barrier Repair Moisturizer with Pre & Postbiotics](https://www.authenticego.com/collections/all/products/super-sensa-barrier-repair-moisturizer-with-pre-postbiotics)\n\n## Why I made it\n\nWhy is it still so hard to find a moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts? Super Sensa is the result of the research I did alongside our formulator to make a moisturizer that’s as hydrating as possible while still being lightweight enough to minimize the risk of breakouts.\n\nIf every moisturizer you’ve tried makes you break out, this one is for you.\n\nIt has a thick gel-cream texture, 6% Prebiotics & Postbiotics, 1% Tremella Snow Mushroom Extract, Mugwort, a blend of 4 hydrators, low-dose Niacinamide and a patented Peptide designed to minimize skin irritation and increase resilience to external aggressors and dryness.\n\nI also tested it for optimal safety and tolerance for even the most sensitive skin and put it through Human Repeat Insult Patch Testing (HRIPT). You can read more about our [safety and testing here](https://www.authenticego.com/pages/faq).\n\n## Here’s The Detailed Active Ingredient Notes\n\n***Niacinamide:*** Everyone loves niacinamide right? So many of us have issues with it because high concentrations can be irritating and actually increase breakouts. I used a 4% concentration so more people can enjoy the benefits of this ingredient while minimizing the risk of side effects.\n\n***Syn-Up Peptide:*** Also known as Amidinobenzyl Benzylsulfonyl D-Seryl Homophenylalaninamide Acetate. A new synthetic peptide that helps to fight against dryness, irritation, and redness by boosting good skin bacteria.\n\n***Tremella Snow Mushroom Extract:*** Are you a hyaluronic acid hater like me? I have good news… Snow Mushroom is a polysaccharide humectant that provides superior hydration to HA in both low and high-humidity environments by forming a thin protective layer over the skin that remains flexible and soft over time.\n\n**Pre & Postbiotics:** We all know that a diverse microbiome helps to give your skin the ability to defend itself against inflammation, stress, and irritation. I use a combo of Inulin, Trehalose, Lactobacillus Ferment, Alpha-Glucan Oligosaccharide, Bifida Ferment, Polyglutamic Acid & a Xylitol trio.\n\n**Betaine & Glyceryl Glucoside:** A soothing duo that’s majorly hydrating and underutilized due to their cost. Both promote moisture retention and long-term hydration. Glyceryl Glucoside increases the skin’s aquaporin count. And Betaine doubles up as a calming agent. Think Glycerin, but way less stickiness.\n\n## Full Ingredients\n\n4% Niacinamide\n\n2% Betaine\n\n2% Glyceryl Glucoside\n\n6% Prebiotics & Postbiotics\n\n1% Tremella Snow Mushroom Extract\n\n1% Amidinobenzyl Benzylsulfonyl D-Seryl Homophenylalaninamide Acetate (Syn-Up Peptide)\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Squalane, Propanediol, Glyceryl Glucoside, Niacinamide, Betaine, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Maltodextrin, Inulin, Swertia Chirata Extract, Artemisia Annua Flower Extract, Amidinobenzyl Benzylsulfonyl D-Seryl Homophenylalaninamide Acetate, Trehalose, Lactobacillus Ferment, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Acetyl Heptapeptide-4, Alpha-Glucan Oligosaccharide, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\n## [Tidy Pores Water Jelly Lipid Peroxidation Serum With Stabilized Vitamin C](https://www.authenticego.com/collections/all/products/tidy-pores-serum)\n\n## Why I made it\n\nWe need more products that explicitly target oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in acne-prone skin. And we need to move past the narrow focus of just killing bacteria and exfoliating because oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are the two earliest events that precede acne development. Bacterial overgrowth/imbalance and excess skin buildup happen *after* these events, not before.\n\nA lot of products on the market not only don’t target these pathways, but they also contain ingredients that make lipid peroxidation and breakouts worse (Many plant oils, esters and fatty alcohols are major offenders).\n\nIf lipid peroxidation didn’t exist, neither would acne.\n\nTidy Pores is an active ingredient, antioxidant, and post-acne mark fading POWERHOUSE. It took several months of development to fine-tune the percentages, get the notoriously difficult Phloretin to cooperate, and to perfect the weightless texture.\n\nI tested it for optimal safety and tolerance for even the most sensitive skin and put it through Human Repeat Insult Patch Testing (HRIPT). You can read more about our [safety and testing here](https://www.authenticego.com/pages/faq).\n\n## Here's The Detailed Active Ingredient Notes\n\n***Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate:***\n\nWe’re using the newer Vitamin C derivative Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate. It’s formed by conjugating Ascorbic Acid with Kojic Acid and is the most stable Vitamin C derivative on the market. A 0.1% concentration is all that’s needed to see effective results making it great for sensitive skin or those who can’t tolerate traditional Vitamin C serums.\n\n* Exhibits excellent antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity to protect your skin from oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation\n* Acts as a potent Tyrosinase inhibitor which helps to decrease melanin production to keep skin looking even and clear\n* Effective at stimulating collagen production even at ultra-low percentages\n\n***Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol:***\n\nThis antioxidant exhibits truly broad spectrum antioxidant activity against the full range of daily aggressors that can negatively impact the skin. It’s the most potent topical ingredient available to protect skin from oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. It has stronger antioxidant capacity than Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Resveratrol, or CoQ10, and is the only topical antioxidant that protects against all 3 forms of reactive species that cause free radical damage: ROS (Oxygen), RNS (Nitrogen), and RCS (Carbonyl).\n\n**Phloretin:**\n\nDue to its (off-the-wall 🤑) cost and the general formulation difficulties it presents, this ingredient is underutilized in skincare formulas. We use a 0.5% concentration which has been clinically tested to be effective for acne-prone skin and is still high enough to be effective while negating the need to use alcohol in the formula which is necessary for higher percentages.\n\n* Has calming and soothing properties that minimize irritation, redness, and target skin stress.\n* Increases native ceramide production, inhibits collagen degradation, and accelerates cell turnover\n* Posesses potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties that prevent oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation and also protects skin from UV-induced damage\n* A superior tyrosinase inhibitor that has been shown to be more effective than Kojic Acid or Arbutin\n\n**Silymarin:**\n\nAlso known as Milk Thistle or **Silybum Marianum Extract,** this ingredient is a naturally occurring flavinoid found in the seeds of the Milk Thistle plant. It’s a potent antioxidant with unique properties that make it particularly great for acne-prone skin.\n\n* Has anti-inflammatory properties help to calm skin irritation and stress while protecting against external pollution and environmental aggressors\n* Sebum-regulating properties help to regulate oil production without causing dryness making it perfect for acne-prone skin\n* Antioxidant properties shield skin from oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation which can lead to clogged pores\n\n***Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane:***\n\nTetrahydrodiferuloylmethane is a novel, powdered extract that’s derived from the Turmeric plant. It has amazing antioxidant properties that outperform many tradtionally used antioxidants. Where it really shines is its’ ability to target and fade skin discoloration and pigmentation from UV-induced damage or post-acne marks. This extract is completely colorless and odorless and won’t cause any staining of the skin that can be a challenge with other Turmeric Extracts.\n\n* Tyrosinase inhibitor that helps to target the look of post-acne marks and UV-induced discoloration\n* Helps to boost the skin’s natural hyaluronic acid content which keeps skin supple and hydrated\n* Anti-inflammatory and anti-irritant properties that help to calm and visibly reduce skin irritation\n\n## Full Ingredients\n\n5% Acetamidoethoxyethanol\n\n2% Betaine\n\n2% Glyceryl Glucoside\n\n1% Portulaca Oleracea Extract\n\n.5% Phloretin\n\n.5% Silybum Marianum Extract\n\n.5% Glycyrrhetinic Acid\n\n.5% Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\n.2% Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane\n\n.1% Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate\n\n.1% Tremella Snow Mushroom Extract\n\n.05% Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol\n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Acetamidoethoxyethanol, Propanediol, Betaine, Glyceryl Glucoside, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract (Purslane Extract), Lactobacillus Ferment, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phloretin, Silybum Marianum Extract (Milk Thistle Extract), Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root Extract), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea Extract), Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, Panthenol, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp (Silver Ear Mushroom) Extract, Acetyl Heptapeptide-4, Lactic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol.\n\nHit me with your questions in the comments below.\n",

(That explains why I got it for cheap in a beauty box deal...)\n\nSo this review probably isn’t accurate for the current version, but I found RBF resoundingly “meh”. It tends to pill a bit on me, and it feels a bit...sticky? Especially around my eyes/eyelids. But it isn’t too shiny or greasy. I would not repurchase this at retail price. I am not sure that this would be a good rec for sensitive skin, but perhaps the new formula is much better.\n\nThe RBF is a chemical sunscreen, so little to no white cast. I haven’t tried the other two Babo ones, but they are both physical sunscreens. The first might be more white-casty, and it looks like the Tinted only comes in one shade. So perhaps see if you could find photos or a sample of that tint to see if it would work with your skintone?",

I’ve been waking up with little whiteheads every day for months and the 2 days I used the dermalogica cleanser I didn’t wake up with any new ones.\n\nOn Friday night I used Bioderma atoderm eye cream around my eyes and woke up Saturday morning and noticed darkness on the outer corner of my eye but I thought nothing of it. I had been using this product earlier this year for a few months and had no reaction to it but I hadn’t used it since then. So I used the dermalogica cleanser and eye cream again yesterday and after washing my face and applying the eye cream straight after I noticed my whole eye area was red and wrinkly. I immediately washed the cream off and last night I used my normal cleanser instead, avoiding my eye area but today I’ve woken up with both eyes swollen, red and itchy. \n\nI’m just wondering if anyone knows what one of these products could have caused this. I know it could be anything but I’ve heard of eyelid dermatitis caused by acrylates so I was thinking maybe it could be the Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer in the eye cream but I’m not sure. \n\nHere are the ingredients\nDermalogica cleansing gel \nWater/Aqua/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Cymbopogon Nardus (Citronella) Oil, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Capryloyl Glycine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Methylpropanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA.\n\nBioderma eye cream \nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Dipropylene Glycol, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Seed Oil, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sucrose Stearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Mannitol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Xylitol, Citric Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Rhamnose, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Fructooligosaccharides.

I’m pretty pale and I don’t really see a heavy white cast at all but there are some pretty good antioxidants in this sunscreen which can protect against free radicals and potential anti-aging! It makes me slightly paler but my friends don’t notice at all. I also have dry combo skin and particularly oily around the t zone. The only thing I don’t really like about it is the stickiness after putting it on my face but the skin glow I get after a bit of sweating on my face makes it all worth! I actually find this product to be the perfect consistency for my skin because I don’t feel oily at all after a couple hours outdoors and I haven’t broken out so far.",
