        "body": "Extra interesting tidbits:\n\n- People could still enter/exit the building thanks to an entryway that moved with it, which connected to a special curved sidewalk (seen in the GIF)\n\n- The move was because Bell bought the building but needed bigger headquarters. They planned to demolish it but that would've interrupted phone service for a big chunk of Indiana, which they didn’t want to do.\n\n- EDIT: They lifted the whole building with steam-powered hydraulic lifts, then set it on enormous pine logs. It was moved via hand-operated jacks, which pushed it over the logs 3/8\" at a time. Once the building rolled far enough forward, the last log would be moved to the front.\n\n- The rotation plan was conceived & executed by famous architect Kurt Vonnegut Sr (father of the famous author)\n\n- The feat remains one of the largest building-moves in history.\n\n- The building was demolished in 1963.",

The crater itself is centred at 165° E, 73° N on the martian surface. The image has aresolution of roughly 21 metres per pixel.  \n\n> This image was created using data from the nadir and colour channels of the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC). The nadir channel is aligned perpendicular to the surface of Mars, as if looking straight down at the surface.\n\n[Here](https://www.google.com/mars/#lat=72.662262&lon=165.407016&zoom=6&q=Korolev%20crater) this is on Google Mars.\n\n[Here](https://trek.nasa.gov/mars/#v=0.1&x=165.79120226781475&y=72.96546543256117&z=6&p=urn%3Aogc%3Adef%3Acrs%3AEPSG%3A%3A104905&d=) it is on NASA's Mars Trek.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the correction /u/PageFault.

It's a real photograph, this one: http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2018/12/plan_view_of_korolev_crater/18937953-1-eng-GB/Plan_view_of_Korolev_crater_node_full_image_2.jpg\n\nThen, since the picture is taken from above and they have a precise 3D map of the ground they just projected the picture on the 3D map so that we can see it from another angle, that's all. Which means, it's the same thing as when you look at google maps in 3D: it's real photos, and nobody claims, when they look at Google Maps in Satellite mode that it's \"a computer-generated image of the Earth\". When /u/pm_me_ur_big_balls claims it's \"a computer-generated image based on topographic data gathered\", it seems that he read somewhere how the 3D model of the ground was produced, not understanding the most important part: a real, high-res photograph of the ground was shot by ESA and projected on it. And no, they didn't \"just add the color\", the photograph was taken in color, as he quoted himself just above: the \"High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC)\" has color channels, it is a color camera.\n\nI would also like to reject the claim that I am a collection of sticks, as my title didn't imply anything else.",

For anyone interested in the history of the discovery of water on mars, see [this excellent wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_discoveries_of_water_on_Mars).\n\n* **We've known there is ice in Korolev crater for a while too.**  [Here's an mosaic of Viking images](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Mars_NPArea-PIA00161.jpg) from the 1970s and 1980s showing Mars' north pole (Korolev is white circle at the 1-o'clock position, halfway from the center).\n\nI don't want to seem like I'm coming down hard on OP, but I think it's important to share images of the planets with more context, as posts with almost no context can be misleading or a bit confusing.\n\nEdit: For clarity, photograph is probably the least ambiguous word to use when referring to an image taken by a spacecraft camera.  Image can potentially refer to both photographs and renders, at least in non-scientific publications.",

I live in Michigan, actually know people from Flint, have actually followed reporting regarding the water crisis. I’m stunned I even have to explain this. Flint does NOT have clean drinking water, the filters are not enough, and there are an array of Michigan government officials INCLUDING THE EX-GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN who have been criminally charged for their conduct of effectively poisoning the city. No one, not Flint, not the town this man in the video, or anyone should be without clean drinking water.

    "body": "I wanted to address Reddit's continued, provably false statements, as well as answer some questions from the community, and also just say thanks.\n\n*(Before beginning, to the uninitiated, \"the Reddit API\" is just how apps and tools talk with Reddit to get posts in a subreddit, comments on a post, upvote, reply, etc.)*\n\n# Reddit: \"Developers don't want to pay\"\n\nSteve Huffman on June 15th: \"These people who are mad, they’re mad because they used to get something for free, and now it’s going to be not free. And that free comes at the expense of our other users and our business. That’s what this is about. It can’t be free.\"\n\nThis is the false argument Steve Huffman keeps repeating the most. Developers are *very* happy to pay. Why? Reddit has many APIs (like voting in polls, Reddit Chat, view counts, etc.) that they haven't made available to developers, and a more formal relationship with Reddit has the opportunity to create a better API experience with more features available. I expressed this willingness to pay many times throughout phone calls and emails, for instance here's one on literally the very first phone call:\n\n> \"I'm honestly looking forward to the pricing and the stuff you're rolling out provided it's enough to keep me with a job. You guys seem nothing but reasonable, so I'm looking to finding out more.\"\n\nWhat developers **do** have issue with, is the unreasonably high pricing that you originally claimed would be \"based in reality\", as well as the incredibly short 30 days you've given developers from when you announced pricing to when developers start incurring massive charges. Charging developers [29x higher than your average revenue per user](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) is not \"based in reality\".\n\n# Reddit: \"We're happy to work with those who want to work with us.\"\n\nNo, you are not.\n\nI outlined numerous suggestions that would lead to Apollo being able to survive, even settling on the most basic: just give me a bit more time. At that point, a week passed without Reddit even answering my email, not even so much as a \"We hear you on the timeline, we're looking into it.\" Instead the communication they *did* engage in was telling internal employees, and then moderators publicly, that I was trying to blackmail them.\n\nBut was it just me who they weren't working with? \n\n- Many developers during Steve Huffman's AMA expressed how for several months they'd sent emails upon emails to Reddit about the API changes and received absolutely no response from Reddit ([one example](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnk2pp3), [another example](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnk2q0e)). In what world is that \"working with developers\"?\n- Steve Huffman said \"We have had many conversations — well, not with Reddit is Fun, he never wanted to talk to us\". The Reddit is Fun developer [shared emails with The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763661/reddit-rif-is-fun-developer-ceo-steve-huffman) showing how he outlined many suggestions to Reddit, none of which were listened to. I know this as well, because I was talking with Andrew throughout all of this.\n\nReddit themselves promised they would listen on our call:\n\n> \"I just want to say this again, I know that we've said it already, but like, we want to work with you to find a mutually beneficial financial arrangement here. Like, I want to really underscore this point, like, we want to find something that works for both parties. This is meant to be a conversation.\"\n\nI know the other developers, we have a group chat. We've proposed so many solutions to Reddit on how this could be handled better, and they have not listened to an ounce of what we've said. \n\nAsk yourself genuinely: has this whole process felt like a conversation where Reddit wants to work with both parties?\n\n# Reddit: \"We're not trying to be like Twitter/Elon\"\n\nTwitter famously destroyed third-party apps a few months before Reddit did when Elon took over. When I asked about this, Reddit responded:\n\n> Reddit: \"I think one thing that we have tried to be very, very, very intentional about is we are not Elon, we're not trying to be that. We're not trying to go down that same path, we're not trying to, you know, kind of blow anyone out of the water.\"\n\nSteve Huffman showed how untrue this statement was in [an interview with NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-blackout-protest-private-ceo-elon-musk-huffman-rcna89700) last week:\n\n> In an interview Thursday with NBC News, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman praised Musk’s aggressive cost-cutting and layoffs at Twitter, and said he had chatted “a handful of times” with Musk on the subject of running an internet platform. \n> \n> Huffman said he saw Musk’s handling of Twitter, which he purchased last year, as an example for Reddit to follow. \n> \n> “Long story short, my takeaway from Twitter and Elon at Twitter is reaffirming that we can build a really good business in this space at our scale,” Huffman said. \n\n# Reddit: \"The Apollo developer is threatening us\"\n\nSteve Huffman on June 7th on a call with moderators:\n\n> Steve Huffman: \"Apollo threatened us, said they’ll “make it easy” if Reddit gave them $10 million. This guy behind the scenes is coercing us. He's threatening us.\"\n\nAs mentioned in the last post, thankfully I recorded the phone call and can show this to be false, to the extent that Reddit *even apologized four times for misinterpreting it*:\n\n> Reddit: \"That's a complete misinterpretation on my end. I apologize. I apologize immediately.\"\n\n(Note: as Steve declined to ever talk on a call, the call is with a Reddit representative)\n\n([Full transcript](https://christianselig.com/apollo-end/reddit-call-transcript.txt), [audio](https://christianselig.com/apollo-end/reddit-third-call-may-31-end.m4a))\n\nDespite this, Reddit and Steve Huffman still went on to repeat this potentially career-ending lie about me internally, and publicly to moderators, and have yet to apologize in any capacity, instead Steve's AMA has shown anger about the call being posted.\n\nSteve, I genuinely ask you: if I had made potentially career-ending accusations of blackmail against you, and you had evidence to show that was completely false, would you not have defended yourself?\n\n# Reddit: \"Christian has been saying one thing to us while saying something completely different externally\"\n\nIn Steve Huffman's AMA, a user asked why he attempted to discredit me through tales of blackmail. Rather than apologizing, Steve said: \n\n> \"His behavior and communications with us has been all over the place—saying one thing to us while saying something completely different externally.\"\n\nI responded: \n\n> \"Please feel free to give examples where I said something differently in public versus what I said to you. I give you full permission.\"\n\nI genuinely have no clue what he's talking about, and as more than a week has passed once more, and Reddit continues to insist on making up stories, I think the onus is on me to show all the communication Steve Huffman and I have had, in order to show that I have been consistent throughout my communication, detailing that I simply want my app to not die, and offering simple suggestions that would help, to which they stopped responding:\n\nhttps://christianselig.com/apollo-end/reddit-steve-email-conversation.txt\n\n# Reddit: \"They threw in the towel and don't want to work with us\"\n\nAgain, this is demonstrably false as shown above. I did not throw in the towel, you stopped communicating with me, to this day still not answering anything, and elected to spread lies about me. This forced my hand to shut down, as I only had weeks before I would start incurring massive charges, you showed zero desire to work with me, and I needed to begin to work with Apple on the process of refunding users with yearly subscriptions.\n\n# Reddit: \"We don't want to kill third-party apps\"\n\n**That is what you achieved**. So you are either very inept at making plans that accomplish a goal, you're lying, or both.\n\nIf that wasn't your intention, you would have listened to developers, not had a terrible AMA, not had an enormous blackout, and not refused to listen to this day.\n\n# Reddit: \"Third-party apps don't provide value.\"\n\n(Per an interview with [The Verge](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/reddits-ceo-says-third-party-apps-add-no-value-hes-measuring-it-all-wrong.html).)\n\nI could refute the \"not providing value\" part myself, but I will let Reddit argue with itself through statements they've made to me over the course of our calls:\n\n>  \"We think that developers have added to the Reddit user experience over the years, and I don't think that there's really any debating that they've been additive to the ecosystem on Reddit and we want to continue to acknowledge that.\"\n\nAnother:\n\n> \"Our developer community has in many ways saved Reddit through some difficult times. I know in no small part, your work, when we did not have a functioning app. And not just you obviously, but it's been our developers that have helped us weather a lot of storms and adapt and all that.\"\n\nAnother:\n\n> \"Just coming back to the sentiment inside of Reddit is that I think our development community has really been a huge part why we've survived as long as we have.\"\n\n# Reddit: \"No plans to change the API in 2023\"\n\nOn one call in January, I asked Reddit about upcoming plans for the API so I could do some planning for the year. They responded:\n\n> \"So I would expect no change, certainly not in the short to medium term. And we're talking like order of years.\"\n\nAnd then went on to say: \n\n> \"There's not gonna be any change on it. There's no plans to, there's no plans to touch it right now in 2023.\"\n\nSo I just want to be clear that not only did they not provide developers much time to deal with this massive change, they said earlier in the year that it wouldn't even happen.\n\n# Reddit's hostility toward moderators\n\nThere's an overall tone from Reddit along the lines of \"Moderators, get in line or we'll replace you\" that I think is incredibly, incredibly disrespectful.\n\nOther websites like Facebook pay literally [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/cognizant-getting-200m-from-facebook-to-moderate-violent-content-amid-allegations-of-filthy-work-conditions-report) for moderators on their platform. Reddit is incredibly fortunate, if not exploitative, to get this labor completely free from unpaid, volunteer users.\n\nThe core thing to keep in mind is that **these are not easy jobs that hundreds of people are lining up to undertake**. Moderators of large subreddits have indicated the difficulty in finding quality moderators. It's a really tough job, you're moderating potentially millions upon millions of users, wherein even an incredibly small percentage could make your life hell, and wading through an absolutely gargantuan amount of content. Further, every community is different and presents unique challenges to moderate, an approach or system that works in one subreddit may not work at all in another.\n\nDo a better job of recognizing the entirety of Reddit's value, through its content and moderators, are built on free labor. That's not to say you don't have bills to keep the lights on, or engineers to pay, but treat them with respect and recognize the fortunate situation you're in.\n\n# What a real leader would have done\n\nAt every juncture of this self-inflicted crisis, Reddit has shown poor management and decision making, and I've heard some users ask how it could have been better handled. Here are some steps I believe a competent leader would have undertaken:\n\n- Perform basic research. For instance: Is the official app missing incredibly basic features for moderators, like even being able to see the [Moderator Log](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/tk5h9b/anyway_to_look_at_the_mod_log_on_mobile/)? Or, [do blind people exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/1447ibp/what_apps_meet_your_access_needs/)?\n- Work on a realistic timeline for developers. If it took you 43 days from [announcing the desire to charge](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) to [even decide what the pricing would be](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/), perhaps 30 days is too short from when the pricing is announced to when developers could be start incurring literally millions of dollars in charges? It's common practice to give 1 year, and other companies like Dark Sky when deprecating their weather API literally gave 30 **months**. Such a length of time is not necessary in this case, but goes to show how extraordinarily and harmfully short Reddit's deadline was.\n- Talk to developers. Not responding to emails for weeks or months is not acceptable, nor is not listening to an ounce of what developers are able to communicate to you.\n\nIn the event that these are too difficult, you blunder the launch, and frustrate users, developers, and moderators alike:\n\n- Apologize, recognize that the process was not handled well, and pledge to do better, talking and listening to developers, moderators, and the community this time\n\n# Why can't you just charge $5 a month or something?\n\nThis is a really easy one: Reddit's prices are too high to permit this.\n\nIt may not surprise you to know, but users who are willing to pay for a service typically use it more. Apollo's existing subscription users use on average 473 requests per day. This is more than an average free user (240) because, unsurprisingly, they use the app more. Under Reddit's API pricing, those users would cost $3.52 monthly. You take out Apple's cut of the $5, and some fees of my own to keep Apollo running, and you're literally losing money every month.\n\nAnd that's your *average* user, a large subset of those, around 20%, use between 1,000 and 2,000 requests per day, which would cost $7.50 and $15.00 per month *each* in fees alone, which I have a hard time believing anyone is going to want to pay.\n\nI'm far from the only one seeing this, the Relay for Reddit developer, initially somewhat hopeful of being able to make a subscription work, [ran the same calculations](https://www.reddit.com/r/RelayForReddit/comments/14bluna/comment/jogj9zr) and found similar results to me.\n\n**By my count that is literally every single one of the most popular third-party apps having concluded this pricing is untenable.**\n\nAnd remember, [from some basic calculations](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) of Reddit's own disclosed numbers, Reddit appears to make on average approximately $0.12 per user per month, so you can see how charging developers $3.52 (or 29x higher) per user is not \"based in reality\" as they previously promised. That's why this pricing is unreasonable.\n\n# Can I use Apollo with my own API key after June 30th?\n\nNo, Reddit [has said this is not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infinity_For_Reddit/comments/14c7v84/comment/jokqfe4/?context=1).\n\n# Refund process/Pixel Pals\n\nAnnual subscribers with time left on their subscription as of July 1st will automatically receive a pro-rated refund for the time remaining. I'm working with Apple to offer a process [similar to Tweetbot/Twitterrific](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/02/tweetbot-twitterrific-subscription-refunds/) wherein users can decline the refund if they so choose, but that process requires some internal working but I'll have more details on that as soon as I know anything. Apple's estimates are in line with mine that the amount I'll be on the hook to refund will be about $250,000.\n\nNot to turn this into an infomercial, but that is a lot of money, and if you appreciate my work I also have a fun separate [virtual pets app called Pixel Pals](https://pixelpals.app) that it would mean a lot to me if you checked out and supported (I've got a cool update coming out this week!). If you're looking for a more direct route, Apollo also has a tip jar at the top of Settings, and if that's inaccessible, I also have a tipjar@apolloapp.io PayPal. Please only support/tip if you easily have the means, ultimately I'll be fine.\n\n# Thanks\n\nThanks again for the support. It's been really hard to so quickly lose something that you built for nine years and allowed you to connect with hundreds of thousands of other people, but I can genuinely say it's made it a lot easier for us developers to see folks being so supportive of us, it's like a million little hugs.\n\n\\- Christian",

I use Arq for file backup and they provide a configuration to use an existing Amazon S3 bucket I pay for which is super convenient. Why can’t I pay for an API key so all requests I make go through it and then I pay monthly for usage? Hell I’ll pay Reddit a fee just to be granted an API key to enable this. This is simply hostile by Reddit and runs in contradiction with their goals to make money from developer API access.\n\n2) Christian is on the hook for QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS to pay back Apollo annual subscribers and there’s likely not a way to quickly build a toggle for users to opt in and say “no way, keep the money” because the timeframe is too short. Again, not only is Christian losing his main source of income but also is out of pocket $250,000 due to shitty actions by Reddit.\n\nPersonally I want to see Reddit slapped with a monster lawsuit because Christian is right: their lies will impact his career going forward and have tarnished his reputation. \n\nFuck Reddit and fuck Spez",

Folks have made millions.\n\n> These aren’t like side projects or charities, they’ve made millions.\n\n> You’re talking to them, go ask them! Millions.\n\nIt does seem reasonable, on the *surface*. But wait...\n\nOther people are making money on reddit too. Countless services are offered — copywriting, blogs, code, legal advice, etc. — and people earn income. Is Steve going to approach each one of them and say\n\n> Hey! You're making money off of reddit *while we're still not profitable*? **How dare you!!! You're done here!**\n\n## Here's the real kicker\n\nSteve thinks it is absolutely, undeniably wrong for Christian to be making millions while Reddit is still not profitable. Let's set aside the point that he's pitting a *one-guy* operation against an *entire* corporation.\n\nSo, Stevie, my dear, you believe it is **immoral** to be making millions off of Reddit ***when Reddit isn't even profitable***. \n\n**Would you please be so kind as to declare your compensation including salary and stock grants for the last fiscal year?**\n\nWhat, my love? **Did you just say you made *millions* while *Reddit isn't even profitable?***\n\n**YOU MADE *MILLIONS* WHILE *REDDIT ISN'T EVEN PROFITABLE*?**\n\nOh, Stevie.

        "body": "Dear Mr. Guillermo, \n\nI just wanted to say how much I love and am grateful for your creations. You are one of the many reasons I am glad to be alive at this time in history.  Because you create new worlds and characters that reflect reality in such a powerful, but understated way. Because you have followed your heart to write and direct, this world is a better and more interesting place to live in. \n\nI was 16 when I went to see my first R-Rated movie. It was midnight, the opening night of Pan's Labyrinth and knew nothing about the movie. When I got there, the theater was close to empty, which I thought was odd.\n\nBut when the movie began, I was entranced.  I didn't expect this movie to combine history and fantasy in such a sublime way. I didn't know it would be so violent and terrifying. I didn't expect Ophelia's innocence and vulnerability to bring me to tears and make me wish I could reach in and rescue her. \n\nSeeing this movie full of violence, kindness, and bravery changed me as a person. I decided that people who refused or didn't like to watch subtitles, were stupid and didn't know what amazing art they were missing out on. I have felt empowered to write, even if I can't seem to do it well. Seeing that movie on my own was basically the first \"grown-up\" thing I had ever done. And it's a precious memory. Pan's Labyrinth will always have a special place in my heart.  \n\nIt is not the only film that I love, however. The Devil's Backbone is another personal favorite and masterpiece.  Pretty anything you have written, as well as directed, blows my mind.\n\nYou never go overboard. Everything is tastefully understated, but powerful. \n\nMy only hope is that you continue to follow your unique aesthetic, your muse in creating more and more art. Whether they are movies, books, illustrations, virtual reality, open world games,  or poetry....  Please keep creating more and more. \n\nI am a huge fan of Pablo Neruda and Federico Garcia Lorco, by the way, so I am really hoping you also publish poetry one day. Because knowing what a beautiful mind and heart you have through your work makes me certain that you also write poetry. ☺️ \n\nI try not to see trailers or read synopses for your movies anymore. Because I love the surprise and experience of finding out on my own. I have only seen posters for The Shape of Water. I wonder what it will be like when I finally get to see it. Is it a moral tale? Will there be great love and suffering? Will there be tenderness and faith? All these questions just from a poster.... It's driving me crazy. \n\nI can't wait to find out!",

He threw a bunch of huge steel plates into the back of his truck brought them home, dug a huge hole and welded it all together.\n\nThis thing even had portholes! two of which had the glass removed and were kinda of filled out to be big steps at the deep end. The last still had its Glass in it. It was on the side of the pool and looked into a stone cavern that had a dryer lid on the top as a door. The cavern even had the steel rung battleship ladder to climb down into it. (a bunch of the pipe adjustments were down here) \n\nThis thing lasted something like 60 years before a marine welder (being battleship steel) would have been required to fix some issues that arose with the pipes. Every few years we would have to repaint the inside to prevent rust, one year when we took off the old coat we found some mermaids had been painted on the bottom most layer.",

The rationale is that if a person falls in they could sink to the bottom and can't be seen.  I really hope that's not the case for this beautiful pool.",

The water line then looks like a thin barrier seperating you from the endless void of space. As you start to float up towards it it can feel like you actually falling into it, and the only thing keeping you on earth is the water. As scuba divers will tell you, at neutral buoyancy you can lose your sense of which way is \"up\" or \"down\". Gravity basically gets replaced by buoyancy underwater. Which makes this whole thing genius. \n\nIf I had the eternity of space in front of me, and this behind me, in a zero G environment, it wouldnt take much \"help\" or imagination to feel like i was really in space.\n\nAwesome work! Just tell him to remember to come up for air! That or get a 20lb weight from the gym and hook a tube up to an air pump and chill on the bottom like some hookah smoking space caterpillar.

Meridian was sold and has since been converted to a mixed-use building with condos, apartments, pool, parking garage and really neat amenities. It's now called 220 Meridian. Here's their promo page https://www.220meridian.com/photogallery ATT had their call center in that building and they had several other office users over the years to split costs. As technology improved and labor forces consolidated, the new addition just wasn't needed and didn't make sense. So the buildings were severed in 2018-2019. This building pictured was designed to make it through the worst of circumstances, that if all else failed at least you'd have a means to contact someone. But now, that's relative given that building doesn't host our telecom towers but does have a lot of backup equipment as always. It's a true marvel that it's still here, lived through an addition and seperation. I don't believe that building was meant to outlive the addition's usefulness for what it was, but it did. They also bought very random, expensive fairly rare Azure glass that make replacements tricky and costly so honestly the new part wasn't ever going to be sustainable in a new tech, profit driven world.",

Green and blue didn’t work at all. Neither did purple.\nWhat worked best was drawing a small black dot, and taking it out and dunking it again, until it came off.\n\nAnd to those very persistent Redditors:\nNo, I did not eat it. Why would I eat it?\n\nNow, my inbox has been flooded with comments. I hope this answered a few of your questions. I don’t mean to be rude at all- thanks for all the attention.

We’ve restored all the original windows, restored the steam heat system, completely upgraded electrical wherever possible, and all new plumbing. Took us about a year to complete the original 3 floor interior before we could move in with help of a father/son carpentry team and ourselves doing whatever didn’t require permits. Exterior, landscaping, hardscaping, new garage, sunroom, and mudroom took about 3.5 years over COVID. The final frontier is the basement, which has beautiful terrazzo floors, full height windows looking toward the double lot, plaster walls and ceiling, and an electric fire. \n\nWe documented everything in a monthly blog at www.between6and7.com if you’re interested in reading the whole journey, including in-depth historical research on the homes original owners… but I’m happy to answer questions about our journey, process, and learnings!\n\n\n",

Black Flag's entire schtick was based around water given that it was a game about pirates on ships... you're going to be in the water by necessity, a lot, and so also by necessity they need to spend time programming shit like that because it's important to the game and the overall experience.  If Legion doesn't have you doing much of anything in the water, then it's less important.  It's why the driving models in racing games are usually better than general open world games.  It's why the water in Sea of Thieves looks and animates like it does while in flight games, nobody gives a shit about the water because you're 5,000 feet up in the air 99% of the time.  We really don't need games to take any longer to develop because we're having devs do stupid shit like spend 6 months accurately coding 3D water, water physics, QA testing it, iterating upon it, etc etc etc in a game where you spend 1% of your time on/in the water.

The water you will interact with will almost only be a result of city scenery, in which they would be in parks or nature. It's entirely possible for a player to never even interact with this water and just observe.\n\nWith that in mind, it makes sense that in a world with finite resources (time, space, money, labor, etc), we really can't expect for water physics to be made. It would make more sense to direct those resources elsewhere, like improving city interactions.\n\nThis isn't to say Watch Dogs is well made, but that this comparison is not a good example to make for the argument.",

The moment your hat touched the water, you instantly rag dolled.\n\nConsidering the setting of Black Flag, the Caribbean islands, the way the player and character interacted with the water was incredibly important. If the water physics weren't convincing, then virtually nothing about that game would work, especially when you consider how important basic traversal was to the game.\n\nIn Legion, however, water is almost non-existent, considering how it takes place entirely in London. The only time you ever interact with water is either the Thames running through the city, which has no points in which you would gradually slope into deeper water, or a pond like this, which I'm pretty sure is the only one in the game.

Commercial HVAC systems have dedicated units in the right places for this sterilization. \n\n* UV light in the AC system will impact some virus that circulates through the system, but only if it is slow moving air to give it enough time to be exposed to UV-C light, and it does nothing to the air a sick person just spread around the room before it cycles via your AC. There is an air ionization option out there to disinfect air in the room, but not without [their own](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/kd67rx/-/gfvcryl) risks.\n\n* Blacklight is a form of UV light (UV-A) and it's what a lot of LED strips are and are harmless both to humans and viruses.

To my knowledge, nobody in our company has specified one for a COVID retrofit, nor has anyone explored it for new construction as a reaction to the pandemic.\n\nUV sections for air handlers are huge, and require a lot of extra static pressure at the fan to overcome the added friction. This idea is basically DOA.\n\nPutting them in ducts would require installing at the mains before any branches tap off, these ducts typically have air moving 1000-1800 feet per minute. That's 500-900 feet of duct that would be required to be lined with UV bulbs.  In the unlikely event you actually had that much available, the cost and disruption to install them would be a nightmare.\n\nWorth noting that in a hospital (EDIT: in the US and anywhere else that follows ASHRAE), patient care areas require MERV 14 filtration which removes about 75% of particles 0.3-1.0 microns in diameter anyway, so there's really no reason to install such a huge and costly system for incremental improvement. Only worth it if you can improve to *total removal* of the virus.\n\nHEPA filters are *practically* 100% effective at removing viruses and much easier to design to fit, so that remains the approach where we feel that level of air scrubbing is necessary.",

Leaving out the SHTF tips as they’re not really relevant here.\n\n-Battery powered fan.  Most important because trying to sleep in the heat / humidity / still air is impossible.\n\n-Chips and salsa are the best food.  No refrigeration, won’t spoil, and you can nibble on it anytime- even if you don’t have an appetite.  Out of all the food we had this was always gone immediately.\n\n-Make block ice now.  Take Tupperware, fill with water.  Freeze it, remove when frozen and repeat.  This ice can last for over a week and will turn your fridge and freezer into a cooler so you don’t lose a ton of food.\n\n-Headlamps are infinitely better than flashlights.  You can cook / function and have both hands free.\n\n-Aluminum foil, rubbing alcohol, and Home Depot buckets can be used for almost anything.\n\n-Buy plastic plates, forks, knives, cups, etc.  Doing dishes without running water is a pain.\n\n-Just because you have a generator doesn’t mean it works.  Test it now.\n\n-Gas cans- for generator and avoiding long lines.  Not sure if Florida runs out of gas or not.\n\n-Bug spray\n\n-Broom and dustpan- lots of debris but surprisingly good at removing water.\n\n-If water is coming through the walls or \nwindows consider killing the power.  Our place caught on fire during Irma due to water in the walls.  This happened to a lot of people during Maria as well.\n\n-Keep electronics off the ground.  If it floods and your power is on, and you’re standing in the water, you’ll have bad day.\n\n-If you have an electric stove, make sure you have some sort of grill and that it has fuel.  Charcoal is good and you don’t necessarily need a grill for it.  \n\n-Keep off the road unless you absolutely \nmust.  In addition to wasting gas, awful traffic and road hazards, you’re preventing emergency vehicles / recovery workers from doing their job.\n\n-Do laundry and dishes beforehand, clean your house.\n\n-Chili, goulash, lasagna, etc are great to make and freeze for later so you don’t have to cook.",

That's because the paper isn't very thermally conductive. It can't move the energy from the torch to the water fast enough, so the outer shell of the paper still gets carbonized. However, once it does, the thermal conductivity shoots way up and it can then transfer the heat more effectively. Pure carbon is a great conductor.",

    "body": "Recently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?\n\nSo the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  \n\n\"Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes and yes!\"  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like \"what is an ounce?\" or \"how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?\"  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro's Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.\n\nAnd it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.\n\nWhen we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.\n\n\"Dose size: 1/2 cookie,\" I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. \n\nAnd then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   \n\nAbout 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that's when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say \"Diarrhea?\"  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.\n\n\"You didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?\" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.\n\n\"Of course not.\" I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.\n\nA few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don't remember how I made it to my seat, and I don't remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if I was doing alright.\n\n\"Keep it together, man,\"  I say to myself.  But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.\n\nThe waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. \n\nThe moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  \n\n\"You are sweating... from your entire face,\" she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  \n\nAt this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  \"Are you alright?\" she asks kindly.\n\n\"Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,\" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   \n\nMy wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. \n\"Bathroom. Now.\" she hisses. \"Get it together.\"  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  \n\nNow, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.\n\nBut deep down I know that is absurd:  I've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?\n\nBut the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. \n\nAfter finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table \"for being gone such a long time\" just in case my math was off. \n\nNext, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --\n or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife's horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.\n\nSmart man. \n\nHowever, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  \"Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?\" I suggest helpfully to my wife.\n\n\"What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.\"\n\nAnd at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  \"HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!\" she demands.\n\n\"Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,\" I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  \"I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don't want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now.\"\n\n\"REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW.\"\n\nI look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.\n\nTL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.\n\n\nEDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.\n\nAs for Part II of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves \"good-bye\" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at \"getting handsie\" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: \"Please don't die, we have a mortgage.\"",

So, a few days later, I eat the rest. again, damn near nothing happens.  As it turns out, I just can't get high off marshmallow based edibles for some reason. They just don't work very well on me. But I didn't know this then.\n\nShe sends me a 220mg chocolate bar a few weeks after that. I remember thinking that well, if roughly 50mg did almost nothing (I felt a tiny itsy bitsy bit of high) then I should eat the entire chocolate bar and maybe I'd get a decent high.\n\nOh my, was that a mistake.\n\nAs it turns out, chocolate based edibles are extra effective on me. Even now, when I have years of experience with edibles and decades of experience smoking weed (I started in 1992), 50mg of THC chocolate is usually too much for me. I'd just eaten 220mg.

It's like I'm riding a weed elevator.\" After about an two hours, I'm losing my shit and then I realize something.

Although different grain sizes, shapes, and material type effect the pore pressure in different ways, generally more water = greater pore pressure = less cohesive material.  \n\nThink of a McDonald's ball pit being filled with water.  The more water you add, the more likely the balls will want to float and move around.  When the pit has no water, balls just stack on top of each other and dont really move. Half full of water, you will get some balls pushing against others, creating different forces throughout the pit.  Water all the way to the top, and balls will spread out, and move almost freely, floating and bumping against each other. This is kind of like adding water too dirt.  The more water you add, the more mobility the dirt grains have, and eventually you just have an uncohesive material (mud).\n\nNow the big problem is when you have no water in the dirt.  Grains of dirt can be so small that they won't let water between them easily.  Instead of the dirt grains letting water seep down through them easily when there is some water in the ground, you might have a situation like a neatly stacked pile of bricks.  Sure water will eventually move through and soak into the bricks, but it will be so much slower.  The pathway for water to travel is much longer. Possibly water will have to seep down, create a bit of pore pressure to let more water in, then seeped down a bit farther, create more pore pressure a bit lower, and continue in this cycle.\n\nThis ability for water to seep into the ground is demonstrated in this gif quite well for surface water, but what happens when it is an entire aquifer?  This is the problem happening in many parts of the world, and notably parts of the south western United States.  Entire aquifers of groundwater are being pumped dry, and since all the dirt grains are stacking on top of themselves, making new water penetration extremely slow, aquifers won't ever fill again until the pumping stops.  Refilling can take in the order of thousands to millions of years.",

It moves faster through wet soil because they are attracted to other water molecules. Think of when you have two water droplets that join - they spring together. When the soil is wet, the soil grains are already coated in water and attract the new water to them, and act as a lubricant for the new water molecules to move across . This is, of course, before 100% saturation is reached, when the water will sit on top of the soil as well. When the soil is dry, the water isn't pulled into it. It will eventually permeate the soil but it is much much slower, as shown in the video. \n\n\n- source: I have a bachelor's degree in Hydrology and watched way too many water moving through soil experiments.",

We stopped to take it out of the street because we thought it was dead and when we picked it up, we saw that he was still breathing but unconcious.\n\n\n\nQuickly put him in a cardboard box. It was middle of the night and no vets were open so we took him home, he wakes up, panics, crawls out of the car (he couldn't use his two back legs) and climbs a 2m fence while I was trying to catch him (he was incredibly strong and wild).\n\n\nEventually we catch him, we put him back in the box with a blanket, food and water, take him to the vet in the morning. Apparently there was a good chance he'd be able to use his back legs again but we had to keep him in a constrained area so that we could keep an eye out for him.\n\nVet keeps him for a day while I go to the hardware store to buy materials to make a 2m x 2m cage for him so that he doesn't have much room to move (so his legs can heal) but at the same time he's comfortable. I tried to make it as nice as possible, with shade, hollow blocks for him to lay in, wooden trunks to scratch his nails on, lots of toys... I even made him a nice soft cloth hammock so he could lay on.\n\n\nFor the next 6 months he hissed and hated my guts every time I went to feed him (three times a day) even though I was trying to be as nice as possible (I think he thought I was the person who ran him over because I'm the first person he saw when he woke up from the accident). However he loved that hammock and used it constantly from the day 1.\n\nAfter those 6 months he slowly became friendlier and friendlier and eventually he became the most cuddly creature you can imagine. Could just sit there cuddling and purring for hours on end. We set him free and the whole area around our house became his domain and he never strays far from our house.\n5 years later and he's my best pal whenever I'm outside doing work in the garden.. always follows me and comes and rubs against me for pets and cuddles. His name is Ludwig.\n\n\nIn those 5 years that \"rehabilitation\" cage has helped us save another 3 stray cats, 1 orphaned goat we found in a gorge and 1 wounded chicken we found in the rubbish.\n\n\nLudwig still uses the hammock :)",

Stopped to blast a dook, wife had to take a two-way trip to Tinkletown. I finished fast, and was waiting for her whilst twiddling my thumbs when she runs up to me, red-faced as a Russian ghost.  \"I've dropped my ring into the toilet,\" she said, looking at me expectantly. I sighed, knowing what comes next, and asked her to keep lookout at the door while I snag it. The restroom was actually quite clean, so it wasn't as bad as you may expect. I'm averting my eyes and wrist-deep in the water when I feel the toilet tremble slightly. The water was warm, as I anticipated, but I realized it was gradually getting warmer. My search becomes more frantic. The bathroom lighting was dim to begin with, but I watched as shadows lengthened and time seemed to stop. Slowly, fearing what I might see, I slid my eyes downward towards the end of my arm. My fingertips were already pruning from my extended toilet diggery, and I realized my nails were turning opaque. I opened my mouth to scream, and only a gentle flushing sound came out.  I wept with bitter frustration as my body doubled over. It seemed like hours, but the rational part of my brain knew it had been but a few minutes. I will never forget the agony as my organs shifted inside my hardening body, re-aligning themselves so that my bladder now stood above my heart, suspended by a tendon connected to my anus. That was the day I learned the hard way that toilets are contaigous.  That was the day I was born anew.",

Then, out of nowhere, it will develop dysentery. It will be left out in the sun, so that it can evaporate and stop feeling the pain of it's disease. It will evaporate slowly and die a painful death, which will cause a rift between the once-loving couple. They try going to their local water filter to cleanse themselves of all the hatred they now have for each other and for the world. It doesn't work, and a couple months of excruciating life later they decide to call it quits. \n\nThey never find another love, and both wander aimlessly just looking for thirsts to quench. Mr. Dasani has long-since been fired from his job as he has been too dry from shedding all his weight in tears. They both now have no place in this world, like broken pieces of a puzzle that never even really fit in the first place. \n\nThe scorching heat caused by the Master Race's abuse of the planet slowly kills off all of their breed, and those two are the last to survive. They end up finding each other at the same filter where they once went to try to fix what was already broken.

These happened during today's (1-Jul-2020) protest against the newly imposed National Security Law in Hong Kong.\n\nOn 30th of June, the National Security Law was passed in China's top legislative body, circumventing the normal legislation process in Hong Kong that was promised under the joint-declaration between the British and Chinese government when HK returned to China back in 1997.\n\n[Hong Kong Free Press](https://hongkongfp.com/2020/07/01/explainer-10-things-to-know-about-hong-kongs-national-security-law-new-crimes-procedures-and-agencies/) did an explainer on this forced-imposed law in HK.\n\nA TL;DR version by me:\n\n1. No advocating independence and self-determination.  No trying to overthrow the government. No more \"Hong Kong Independence\" chants allowed in protests, possibly no also for \"Free HK, Revolution Now\".\n2. The HK Police Force could employ people outside of HK to enforce the laws, suggesting that secret agents from China can be anywhere in HK and spying now.\n3. Even if you protest peacefully and not using violent forces, you still violates the law as long as you are threatening China's national security.\n4. Assualt, arson, damaging public transport and government facilities, jamming the traffic and communication are all considered to be terrorist activities.\n5. No inciting hatred towards either the HK or the Chinese government in an illegal way. \"Illegal\" has a very broad range here, in Hong Kong it is illegal for you to organize and participate in protests without government's permission.\n6. No public trials and juries for cases that are considered to be \"National secret\".\n7. The police can spy and intercept communications on specific person-of-interest.\n8. You will be violating the national security laws of Hong Kong even if you are currently not in HK, and therefore if you say \"Hong Kong independence\" in the US and got China's attention, you could be arrested when you travel to HK.\n9. You could face life imprisonment for violating these laws, depending on the severity.\n\nAn one-sentence TLDR: HK is officially dead, no more anti-government protests in Hong Kong, that includes peaceful marches.\n\nNews reports regarding the National Security Law are also on [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/hongkong-protests-security-highlights/highlights-china-unveils-details-of-national-security-law-for-hong-kong-idUSL4N2E802O), [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/01/asia/hong-kong-national-security-law-intl-hnk/index.html), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-01/-stay-out-of-politics-what-hong-kong-s-law-means-for-business), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/china-unveils-details-of-the-hong-kong-national-security-law.html) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/china-passes-controversial-hong-kong-national-security-law).",

We could not believe how reluctant she was to get wet, even though she is an otter and otters live half of their lives in the water. We tried all kinds of things to lure her into the water, balancing her fish on a manhole cover in the middle of her pool, then using a washing up bowl and when those tricks didn't work we stretched some material across the pool, dropped the fish in it and then gradually lowered it day by day so she had to go in deeper and deeper to get her teeth around her dinner. So it was with great joy that we went out to feed her and found her already playing in the pool. We pulled out the material, threw in fish and hey presto, she dived in, grabbed one and ran off to her hut to wolf it down. Phew! It never ceases to amaze us how each otter has their own unique character - you never know what to expect.\n\n#otter #draatsi #fish #Shetland”\n\nEdit: thank you all for the awards and upvotes ❤️",

Around the back side of Revillagigedo, on the mainland, the terrain is extremely steep (particularly in Misty Fiords National Monument, where you can pull your boat up to a sheer rock wall and fill a glass from a waterfall tumbling down from 1000+ feet above you.  \n\nBehm Canal, which despite its name is a natural channel that separates Revillagigedo from the mainland is 2000+ feet deep in places, with 4,000+ foot mountains around it - by comparison, if you were to drain the water you would have a drop from peak to bottom that was on a scale similar to the Grand Canyon.\n\nIt's not terribly uncommon around here to troll for fish closely enough to land that you can reach out to touch the branches of a tree clinging to the rock face of shore, while still having 200 feet of water beneath you.\n\nMuch of Southeast Alaska is similar.  It is really an amazing part of the planet in so many ways..\n\nBonus Alaska anecdote - Occam's Razor edition:  Every day I go for a walk and most days I walk around my neighborhood.  Frequently this takes me down to walk along the main wharf downtown (as long as the cruise ships are gone for the day.)  On one occasion I was walking along the dock and kept hearing a distinctive noise, and thought to myself \"what is that noise that sounds like a whale surfacing?\"  Of course the simplest explanation is often the best.. I had heard it several times before I finally looked down over the edge of the dock to find that I was being trailed by a curious humpback who followed me for about 1/4 mile before, I presume, concluding that I'm not actually all that interesting..",

Even micobial life can be assumed in the right conditions to evolve into complex organisms over time. This would mean we can reasonably assume that every earthlike planet in the universe with stable conditions has complex organisms on it, or at the vert least a lot of them do. \n\nIt would take life from being some mysterious rare thing and make it into a sort of “duh ofcourse life develops wherever it possibly can thats just what happens” scenario.",

When they put the pin in that back spot, there’s a huge hill that funnels the ball to the hole. The players know if they can just get the ball in a general area, the hill and gravity will do the rest and literally take the ball to the hole (in the general area, still lucky to make). \n\nhttps://youtu.be/CRBlsD9c8Y0\n\nHere’s a better angle of Jons water skip hole out. You can see how he puts the ball on the slop of the hill. That changes the trajectory so it comes out very low. If you swing in a specific way to make the ball spin to the right (a low cut/fade) the ball will skip when it hits the water. All he’s doing is trying to hit a low cut shot and have it hit the other side of the pond. It will hopefully pop up and land on the green, and then the exciting part of seeing how close you can get happens. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/WJEysanOT7w\n\nThis is the same hole Tiger hit that amazing chip on. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/RuLqQJ28304\n\nHere’s Jack one his Sunday run to win his last green jacket.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fcMONfw4MXU\n\nHere’s Louis almost making two hole in ones with one ball.

Most people require much less due to sedentary lifestyles and how much time we spend in climate controlles buildings. Water is expended much faster during exercise due to sweating, but you also exhale more. Most people don't realize how much water we actually lose through respiration. Some people can actually be harmed by drinking 8 glasses a day, always develop an individual plan for yourself.",

I got a message that the video had also reached Reddit.\n\nI’m so happy this has gained so much as it is of course a little white lie for the kids.\n\nVeeti, my son, knows how to wash his hands even before all this started to happen but as a kid, you only see the actual dirt when you usually wash your hands.\n\nIt can be hard to grasp the idea why you should wash yours hands when there’s nothing there. “My hands are clean, look!” could be heard occasionally in the house.\n\nAs the video mentions, I talked about viruses with him the day before and told him they are so small you can’t see them. The demo then was a show to amplify this connection “soap helps with the viruses”.\n\nWe do wash our hands the long way with soap, and rinse good often. He does it by himself too, did before and maybe a little more often now. That why in the video he asks why is there soap still on his finger: he doesn’t like if his hands are dirty or soapy so we went to wash it away afterwards - like a normal person.\n\nI’m happy, the little man is happy and so far on Facebook, 958 000 persons have watched it, even for a while. Over a million have seen it at least to some degree.\n\nMost happy I am about the comments and messages: they have been from families and daycare people and all are thanking for the idea. The mental idea for the kids here is the key, they know how to wash their hands, now they get the idea a little more why they should wash their hands.\n\nOriginal:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/821825758027593/posts/1349516008591896/\n\nI don’t know how to proof that I am Ari but I am.\n\nAnd yes, Valokuvaaja means “Photographer”, it comes from my Facebook Page Name. \n\n//Ari\n\nJa jos siellä on suomalaisia lukemassa tätä viestiä, kiitos. Tuo video lähti käsistä enkä voisi olla iloisempi - niin paljon positiivisuutta liikkeellä sen vuoksi :)\n\nPS. And is my son a germaphobe now? No, absolutely not. Still playing as before but getting to have his hands washed is a breeeeeeze. Smart kid.",

Therefore, adults over 50 are more likely not to experience thirst as intensely as younger people. Plus, exercise and fatigue or stress may also contribute to a diminished thirst response, and children also experience thirst less intensely than adults.  \n>  \n>*Fortunately, our bodies signal hydration another way as well.*  \n>  \n>**Urine color says a lot about our hydration status.** Generally, the lighter the color, the more hydrated you are. But why is that? Well, dehydration is caused when the volume of water in the body is depleted. And when we’re dehydrated, our kidneys, which filter waste, tell the body to retain water. Therefore, we have less water in our urine, which causes it to become more concentrated and darker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthey make cards for soldiers \n\n[https://usaphcapps.amedd.army.mil/hioshoppingcart/viewItem.aspx?id=259](https://usaphcapps.amedd.army.mil/hioshoppingcart/viewItem.aspx?id=259)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFormat: Card   \nLanguage: English   \n\n\n**Product Categories**\n\nDiseases and Conditions\n\n* Heat Injury Prevention\n\n**Product Specifications**\n\n* Dimensions: 3 X 5\n* Pub Date: August 2018\n* **Content: Urine color chart to determine your hydration level.**\n* Proponent: APHC in coordination with the U.S. Army Institute of Research in Environmental Medicine\n* Prod ID # TA-091-0818\n* Audience: All Servicemembers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

But my grandfather stopped her and said “do you want your daughter to be scared of roast beef, let her get back on the horse.” Then he changed the subject and started asking me about school.

And I thought it was strange for the animal to be there and not run up a tree when I came near so I kind of slowed down to see what it would do, but it wouldn’t run away. It kinda came towards me. Then it climbed up on my body and hid under my armpit and it stayed there, so not knowing what to do. I just went home and the squirrel clung to me under my arm without being scared of me or my roommates or anyone. So I showed it to friends. I showed it to my neighbours because I didn’t know what to do. I thought, maybe I adopted  a squirrel or something. I even called my mum to see if she knew anything about squirrels and advice on how to look after them as I thought it was going to stay with me.  After a couple of hours it’s came down my body and it wanted to leave the house by that time the rain had slowed and almost disappeared and I realised that the animal was just really cold and wet and it needed a place to warm up and my armpit was the closest warmest place, but it was a nice experience having a squirrel for a pet for a couple of hours",

There's basically no swimming involved. It's more about using your body as a rudder and trying to direct yourself away from death and towards the shore/eddies, though eddies are nearly non-existent at that volume. You're moving at such a high velocity you barely have time to assess your downstream dangers before you're there.\n\nAbsolutely terrifying, yet thrilling.\n\nSwift water is the most unrelenting and unyielding force I've ever experienced. It's truly unimaginable until you feel it yourself.\n\nI've not ever been in whitewater at nearly those levels since then, nor will I again. I cheated death that day, and have no want to test my luck again. I was **lucky** to have only shattered my right kneecap, fractured my right occipital bone, broke my right wrist, spiral fractured my right ulna, dislocated my right thumb, fractured my right mandible, and received a major concussion (while wearing a helmet).\n\nHave never felt more alive than when I drug myself up onto the bank and pulled myself to my feet though. It was adrenaline overload. I shook and vibrated for hours before I calmed down. Then the pain hit...\n\n**Edit** for those who may be interested. [Here a first person view of someone else doing the same stretch of water, with a little less flow, and not swimming.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h2FtidKqnc)",

It's equivalent of swimming 50 meters long course (since no turns only start) in 24.3 seconds which for backstroke and butterfly or women's freestyle is pretty pacey in practice setting even for Olympic level swimmers (not ridiculously fast though). \n\nSince they keep jumping after each other and getting at it only for few strokes at a time (with each swimming their main stroke) it indicates they are most likely running some sort of a drill. The objective is not to touch the wall on the other side but just to stay on pace for set amount of time and get the fuck out, then wait your turn to do it again probably few more times with different breaks.\n\nThey could be tapering (decreasing the load and allowing body to recover a bit) for a swim meet, which is usually when you work on your speed and pace with a lot lighter load. \n\nMost teams don't have access to this high tech shit and use rubber cords to simulate similar thing. You basically attach a rubber cord to your waist, stretch it as far as it goes and hold on for dear life. \n\nBelieve it or not but this is probably as fun as it gets for swimmers.",

I’ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn’t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children’s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens’ lungs daily.\n\n---\n\n###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. \n\n---\n\n“We would have to agree to disagree” he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.\n\nNot only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner’s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn’t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.\n\nA month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn’t like what he was up to. “What you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I’m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,” he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.\n\nLike most of my generation I was born a coal miner’s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed\nfirst-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.\n\nThe promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.\n\nIt’s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don’t want my children to\ninherit the struggles that we have had to endure. \n\nI’m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I’ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for. It also means I support the [Brand New Congress platform](https://brandnewcongress.org/platform?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801), including Medicare for All, free public higher and vocational education, and moving to an expanded economy for West Virginia and America, based on renewable energy.\n\n**Social Media Links**:\n\n[Website](https://brandnewcongress.org/paulajean) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/paulajean2018) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulajean2018)\n\n**Info Links**:\n\n[Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Paula_Jean_Swearengin) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Jean_Swearengin)\n\n**Other Important Links**:\n\n\n* /r/JusticeDemocrats\n* /r/BrandNewCongress\n* /r/Swearengin4Senate\n\n[Donate to my campaign.](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/paulajean2018?refcode=0801_reddit_ama&amount=27.00) | [Sign up to volunteer.](https://now.brandnewcongress.org/act?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) | [Platform](https://brandnewcongress.org/platform?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801)",

    "body": "I’m couch-surfing with my sister and her BF; I work for him at the lake-side bar, trying to pay for college. My state is “open” and while I’m not thrilled, I need both the job and my scored sofa accommodations to make it work. To give them their space, and myself a break from the doomscrolling, I take a run by the lake in the mornings. This lake is bombass and draws scuba divers to the flooded town at the bottom.\n\nToday, I was in my own head running when a dark mass floated to the surface 40 feet away. I was on the craggy side of the lake and this dude looked dead. D.E.A.D. Facing away from me, his head was tipped back, eyes closed, bobbing like a fishing lure. No one else was around, so I thought he was quantum crazy out here scuba diving alone at the crackass of dawn, giving himself the bends or some nonsense.\n\nLike a jackass, I didn’t yell at him to check-in. Instead, I toed off my shoes and stripped to my skivvies to save the imbecile. The movie trailer in my head had me taking three glorious steps and launching into the deep blue water, black widow style. Instead, my tender feet hit the sharp rocks and I contorted under the pain like a slinky as I uncoordinatedly pitched myself into the water, doing a side-flop. I was also wearing my contacts so I swam hard in his direction with my eyes closed.\n\nWhen I open them, he was dead-ass staring at me like I’d lost my ever-lovin’ mind, so I blurted, “Are you okay?”\n\nHe removed the regulator and incredulously said “yes”.\n\nMy brain blue-screened while I tread water. The lake felt infinitely deep. Before I could terrify myself by hearing the jaws theme song, I turned to nope the hell out of there, yelling over my shoulder, “I thought you needed saving” to explain my idiocy.\n\nAs I pivoted, another dude cleared his throat from 30 feet away on the other side. I never heard a sound from him so I freaked out, failing and belting an ear wounding scream at him.\n\nBoth asshats laughed as a few more heads surfaced around us. I was surrounded by divers all wildly entertained by my ridiculous high-octane FU. After pointing to me and the beach, the merman that was my original target cautiously swam toward me after I nodded and “escorted” me to the shore.\n\nThe beach was much further than I had anticipated, so I was trying to low-key breath, hiding my need to suck all of the O2 from the air. Also, the comedy of the situation consumed me and I started to giggle. Finally, I joked, “Dude, you are lucky you weren’t actually dying because It would have taken everything I have to drag your sorry ass this far.”\n\nHe chuckled before offering me a “tow.”\n\n“Hell, no! Not gonna happen.” Even if I had to dog paddle, I wouldn’t openly accept that defeat.\n\nHe quietly mocked me the rest of the way to the shore. I’m a secret sap for it.\n\nThey were cadets or recent graduates from a military college, here for the summer. They’ve been training in pools and were doing some “open water” exercises; they had been out there at least part of the night. I’m sure I blew-up whatever drill they were running. He’s training for pre-dive school (?) and since I am an expert googler, I’m guessing that means combat diving.\n\nAt the shore, I did my best to throw my shoulders back and march out of the water in my sports bra and undies in front of what I can only imagine are some pretty badass men. I did invite him and his clandestine crew for an absurdly overpriced beer at the bar tonight before shame-jogging back into the woods for my clothes.\n\nTL;DR I tried to save an injured diver-ended up crashing some kind of military training.\n\nEDIT: It's Lake Jocassee in SC. Also, the mereman cheated: he was wearing a floaty vest and fins, that bastard. Ok, I’ll admit there is a part of me that is attracted to his mysterious appearance from the shadow realm, and I’m definitely imaging that he’s constructed from some kind of aluminum steel alloy, but he was also funny and kind. I was vibing his proclivity for witty and sarcastic comments and have a million questions I want to ask him. Ha\n\nEDIT2: Okay, at work now and had to turn off the notifications because you snippers are blowing me up. To all the ladies giving advice earlier...yes, I left the dragon-flies at home and went full cute sundress and Jesus sandals. Tried to wear my hair straight, but it's hot as hate out here and it'll be beach wave sweaty before long. My sister's BF has blabbed the whole thing and all of the staff is in full-on ribbing mode. Kinda great actually. They are currently reading the Reddit post so they are cackling at you people too. So, even if he doesn't show, we're gonna have a great night. We have a long way to go since it's just the dinner crowd, but thanks for making my day great people.\n\nEDIT3: Solid dinner crowd, but no mereman, or frog prince as you people have started to call him. Our lakeside drinking crew will start rolling in another 1-2 hours. I thought you salty bastards of TIFU would chew me up and spit me out, but look at you all showing up in the name of love! You guys are awesome, even if I get ditched it was worth the day with you.\n\nEDIT4: 1 hor later. Still no show :(\n\nEDIT5: HE SHOWED! Holy shit, a little bit ago. Yes, I was as dorky as you would have imagined and now I’m typing this from the bathroom like a dumbass again, but I feel like you people are on the ride with me. He’s handsome and funny and he smells great. Yes, I hugged him. I’m southern…its what we do…not the smelling, the hugging. He’s nice, and smart and keeps defending me from my jackass friends at the bar, who have almost called him merman to his face. I think he low-key likes that everyone knew who he was, but not sure how he’ll feel about being a Reddit celebrity. I’ve learned a lot about him, but it wouldn’t be fair to share without his permission. His whole crew did not come, only one and his bud immediately started flirting with my co-worker. That’s a good sign. I think. Holy, shit you’d think I’d never met up with a guy before. Also, my friend straight up asked him if he saw my “dragonfly undies that look like penises with MASSIVE, glow-in-the-dark turquoise blue balls” only she used the Reddit version  (thanks for that nickname Reddit). He didn’t answer but smirked the truth to me after she left. It was cheeky but cute. He’s also been sharing some of the shit that he's been taking today from being “saved”. He has the same self-deprecating sense of humor as me. I think we are vibing. So, that’s all the updates for tonight. He’s getting the rest of my attention. Keep sending me those good vibes and peace people.\n\nEDIT6: Last and final update because you guys are not letting up. I know this may seem weird since I posted this whole situation out into cyberspace for everyone to see, but yesterday it was just a comical story about a guy I didn't think I would ever see again. Something funny to share when we all need a giggle. Today...well...it feels different to talk about him now that we've spent some time together. I like him. There’s chemistry and similar interest and we have plans to see each other again. I don’t need the pressure of Reddit to help me screw things up. You guys know I’m a bit of an expert in that regard. That’s all, so go do something you love and find a way to at least balance the doomscrolling with some belly laughs. Sending much love to each of you.\n\nEDIT7: “Updates!” You people keep screaming over 3 weeks later. Don’t you have better things to do than pester me about my love life? Ha. The merman, the frog prince, the dashing man from depths, the king of the shadow realm (and the many other nicknames that Reddit has bestowed) is still very much in my life. He’s better than I can describe with my mortal words. Fangirl him if you must because I will understand. Thank you all for the well-wishes and positivity that this post has given. I hope something amazing and magical happens to each of you, and if it happens to be shamefully funny, I hope you will share because we all need as many laughs as we can get. Be safe, everyone.",

Nice idea but not sure it’s worth >69k upvotes.\n\nEdit: Ok, just found the article explaining how it was done. So it is the same scene - I apologise for suggesting it wasn’t - but it was 3 long exposure shots taken from different cameras and stitched together. Impressive technical skill and it looks good but I can’t help feeling it still feels a little fake to me - it’s the angles and the lighting.\n\nDon’t get me wrong though, not saying I could do any better either!",

You could even go as far as putting a dead rat from a pet store, or even a piece of raw chicken near the heat lamp. It'll attract the snake to that spot and then you can try to throw something over it (like a bucket or thick blanket). You might have to wait a few hours for the snake to find the heat lamp though.",

This striking behavior is a well-documented example of parasitic control.\n\nAs the worm matures inside the host, it produces proteins that interfere with the insect's central nervous system, altering its behavior. These chemical signals override the host's instincts, driving it to find a water source and jump in.\n\nWater causes a parasitic hairworm to leave a praying mantis because it is the final stage in the parasite's life cycle and allows it to reproduce. The parasite manipulates the mantis's behavior, forcing it to enter the water, where the parasite escapes and returns to its aquatic habitat to reproduce.\n\nThat’s why lowering a praying mantis into water can actually trigger the parasite to come out — it’s the final step in its life cycle. The worm has already taken control of the mantis’s mind, and water is the cue it’s been waiting for to escape and continue its own survival.",

I stood up, completely bent over in the water and tried to stand all the way up but my back hurt so badly and I kept getting hit by waves. My sister was on the beach watching but she had no clue what had happened. I finally got to the beach and I couldn't move my arm because it was dislocated and I still couldn't stand up all the way. That's the day I learned how fucking strong and heavy and utterly powerful water is and I have 100% respect for what it can do.",

He winked and said, “We’ll see.”  Sure enough, there were tiny sun perch and catfish. Plus tons of crayfish. My dad told me it was Indian magic.
