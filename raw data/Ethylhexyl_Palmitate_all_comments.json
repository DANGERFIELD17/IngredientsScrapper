    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

It is useful for that but some people avoid it due to microplastics (I don't know a whole lot about it, but have heard people say this).*\n\n[***You don't need to be SUPER DUPER concerned about visible light/blue light protection***](https://labmuffin.com/blue-light-computers-phones-damage-skin/) ***and whatnot, even though some of these products claim to protect against them.***\n\n***TINTED sunscreens are lightly tinted usually in beige or peach color.

As always,* ***YMMV.***\n\n*Many of these companies* ***claim*** *that their product is the* ***gentlest*** *for the most sensitive skin because of EWG (Environmental Working Group) rating of 1, but* ***EWG is NOT a reliable source, especially for sensitive skinned folks***\\*\\*, *as they can be very biased and promote skin-sensitizing things just because an ingredient sounds more \"natural\".\\** ***Natural*** *things usually contain much more possible* ***skin triggers*** *than lab-isolated,* ***single*** *ingredients.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Potentially Irritating Filters (From Lab Muffin Beauty Science Blog)***\n\n>**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you’re left with inorganic sunscreens only.  \n>  \n>If you’re elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren’t particularly irritating or allergenic.  \n>  \n>A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SUNSCREEN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.\\[A24\\] Premium Sun Protection Cream -

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "When I heard about this new product line the other day, I decided to look at all the products and their formulations via SkinCarisma to see whether anything looked worth trying. A few products seemed promising, while others seemed... not so much. I thought since I'd already done all the work, I'd share my findings here!\n\nIn order approximately from most to least promising:\n\nBlemish Control Spot Treatment, 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide\n\n- **fungal acne safe!**\n- 5.5% is a higher concentration that necessary but shouldn't be too irritating\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both near end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (at end of ingred. list)\n- some nice **moisturizing** ingredients, including a good amount of squalane\n\nVitamin C Moisturizer\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 8th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (14th ingred.)\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane, lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- small amounts of cassia and green tea\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- advertises inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is last ingredient\n\nDark Spot Solution Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: polysorbate 20 (8th ingred.)\n- **niacinimide** is 2nd ingredient! brightening and anti-aging properties\n- advertises its inclusion of plankton extract but is 24th ingredient (also not much evidence that plankton extract does anything for skin besides moisturizing)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract  (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (last ingred.), citric acid (15th ingred.)\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- possible **allergen**: benzoyl alcohol\n- contains a lot of **silicones**\n\nRetinol Vitamin A Refining Moisturizer\n\n- amount of retinol isn't specified, but is placed 25th on ingredient list (you only need small amounts, 0.01% or more, to be effective, but need 0.5% or more for dramatic effects)\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.), polysorbate 20 (24th), cetyl palmitate (26th) \n- **retinol** has anti-acne, brightening, and anti-aging properties\n- other **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.), ceramide 3 (27th ingred.)\n- tons of aloe juice, good amount of squalane\n- small amounts of green tea and cassia\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- specifically advertises its inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is 26th (second last) on ingred. list\n\nOil-Free SPF 50 Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\n- broad spectrum\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl stearate (2nd ingredient), isopropyl palmitate (7th), PEG-100 stearate (8th)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.)\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: isopropyl palmitate (7th ingred.)\n- pretty small tube, only 50 mL\n\nFerulic Acid + Vitamins C and E Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for its vit C so is not a dupe for SkinCeuticals, but should still be effective\n- amounts of main ingredients not specified, however, vit C is the 5th ingredient, ferulic is 10th, vit E is 18th (second to last)\n- **brightening** ingredients: SAP\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E, citric acid, ferulic acid\n- citric acid (8th ingredient) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingredient)\n\nBio-Complex Moisturizer for Dry Skin\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- claim to have a \"high level\" of hyaluronic acid, and contains 2 kinds, but they're only 21st and 22nd on ingredient list\n- also super unclear on what their \"bio-moist complex\" is but if it comprises 20% of the product it must just be like, aloe and water and glycerin\n- but yeah, tons of aloe and glycerin, good amount of squalane, some other **moisturizing** ingredients, moderate amount of green tea extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (14th ingred.), vitamin E (23rd)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 5th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (13th ingred.), citric acid (10th)\n- contains **denatured alcohol** (3rd ingred.)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingred.)\n- HA is in the name and yet it's the last ingredient\n\nCharcoal Balancing Mask\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: PEG-100 stearate (9th ingred.), stearic acid (10th), glyceryl stearate (12th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- not sure how much charcoal is needed to be effective, but there may be a deceptively small amount in this, as it's the 16th ingredient and the product contains as much or more iron oxide as a colouring agent. also it lists \"charcoal powder\" and NOT \"activated charcoal powder\" so it may just be all-around useless.\n- advertises its use of hyaluronic acid yet it's the last ingredient \n- main mask component is **kaolin** clay (3rd ingred.)\n- 2 kinds of vitamin E (17th and 24th ingredients)\n- lots of aloe and some glycerin but not many other soothing or moisturizing ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: stearic acid (10th ingred.)\n\nHydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: contains polysorbate 80\n- claims to have 5 types of HA but I only counted 3: sodium hyaluronate, hydrolized HA, sodium acetylated hyaluronate (and they're all 18th or later in the ingredient list)\n- contains a TON of **silicone**, which seems like a poor choice to me, as HA should generally be applied earlier on in your routine and all that silicone will interfere with absorption of subsequent layers\n- no other notable or helpful ingredients, just a few **moisturizing** things like glycerin\n- more of a gel texture than a serum\n\nTriple-Peptide Eye Cream\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: stearic acid (3rd ingred.), glycol distearate (4th), shea butter (5th), ethylhexyl palmitate (8th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- peptides are last ingredient\n- contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) but is 18th ingredient and what little benefit that amount gives will deteriorate due to air exposure from jar packaging\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane and caffeine\n- small amounts of green tea and green algae extract\n- 5 potential **comedogens** but this likely won't matter for the eye region\n- if you look up this product on Amazon to examine yourself, note that the copyable list of ingredients in the Important Information section is actually the ingredient list for the Retinol Moisturizer, so use the ingredients listed in the product images\n\nHydrating Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.), pomegranate seed oil (14th), coconut oil (15th), olive fruit oil (16th), argan oil (17th), jojoba oil (18th), babassu seed oil (20th), moringa seed oil (21st), crambe

        "body": "> last ingred.\n\nJust in a \"the more you know\" way, that doesn't necessarily mean it's in a lower concentration than the ingredient that precedes it. In the US, ingredients in concentrations of 1% or lower can be listed in whatever order the manufacturer wants to use. You can sometimes tell where that <1% begins if the product contains phenoxyethanol, because that's approved for use in concentrations of up to 1% -- meaning things *after* that are either at 1% or under.\n\n(Also, 1% HA isn't unusual, nor is it necessarily ineffective; it's normally used at/in concentrations of 0.2-2%. TO often uses 2% because of their unofficial \"more is **always** better\" philosophy [looking at you, 10% niacinamide serum], but <2% can be beneficial, too!)\n\nThat said, you'd think there'd be little reason for Amazon to list a \"banner\" ingredient at the very end when/if they have the option to list it earlier/higher.",

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\n🌟 **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\n🌟 **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\n🌟 **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\n🌟 **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\n🌟  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\n🌟 **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed! i'll also leave my current routine in the comments below, for those who may be interested. i hope this was of some help to y'all :-), and that all of you would have good health during this period!",

I imagine it would perform really well under makeup, or for someone with oily skin. For myself it wouldn’t be enough alone. I’m excited to try it as a hydrating toner. \n\nMulti-Quench feels great on the skin, I’m a sucker for glycerin and it has a nice texture. \n\nMilk Peel has a nice light texture, and is very mildly hydrating. \n\nI will update you all once I finish the bottles. \n\n____________\nMulti Acid Milk Peel: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C13-14 Isoalkane, C11-12 Isoalkane, Phytic Acid, Malic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lipase, Protease, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, C15-23 Alkane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Phenoxyethanol, Tricaprylin, Glyceryl Oleate, Ethylhexyl Polyhydroxystearate, Tetradecane, C13-14 Alkane, Decyl Glucoside, Maltodextrin, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Carrageenan, Silica.\n\nHalf & Half Fluid Moisturizer: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Propanediol, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NS, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Hexapeptide-11, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Triolein, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Glyceryl Oleate, Undecane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Dioleate, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Tridecane, Betaine, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate, PCA, Sodium Benzoate, Serine, Alanine, Palmitic Acid, Glycine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glutamic Acid, Lysine HCl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20.\n\nMulti Quench Plumping Hydration Serum:\n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Polyglutamic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ectoin, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Fruit Extract, Erythritol, Phenoxyethanol, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\n",

I don’t know what it is, but I just vibe with that brand so much (except their sunscreens, which fall a bit short for me personally). I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better!

I bought a bottle of it cuz I was out of my Ordinary Glycolic Acid that I use on my body and also my Dr Dennis Gross Peel Pads for my face (was waiting for their sale to restock my big box. Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products.

I only started to care for my skin when I became 30 early this year, before I would just wash my face with hands soap and only sporadically moisturize it afterwards aaand of course I used to wear sunscreen only at the beach. I know some of you must be screaming internally but believe it or not my skin was not that bad, I basically only had some texture, whiteheads and dullness. Now my issues are more serious and I'm still trying to heal, long story short there were many mistakes: my mom's derm prescribed me a cream that was devastating, a 10% AHA thick one, that not only irritated me but also covered my entire chin and cheeks with CCs. While trying to recover from that I also messed up due to not knowing my skin's needs very well and overusing actives. What I've learned is that I'm extremely prone to congestion, pretty much every product with comedogenic ingredients high up in the list broke me out, and being very oily, I absolutely need light textures and minimal moisture.\n\n**Skin type:** oily, acne-prone and somewhat sensitive.\n\n**Concerns:** acne, inflammation, hyperpigmentation, oiliness.\n\n**Climate:** metiderranean (extremely hot and humid summer up to 40+°C, mildly cold winter, lowest 0°C)\n\n**Routine:** AM BoJ Green Plum Cleanser, Melano CC Premium Essence, toner, Skin1004 Hyalu-Cica Sun Serum; PM Kose Speedy Cleansing Oil, Cerave SA Renewing Cleanser, toner, Skin1004 Pro-Bio Cica Ampoule, Skin1004 Centella soothing cream.\n\nNow time for my reviews, some are completely empty, some I threw away before taking pictures and others are half-way through.\n\n***Beauty of Joseon - Radiance Cleansing Balm***\n\nWhat a treat! Such a luxurious experience, I love everything about it, cleans perfectly every stubborn waterproof mascara, no smell, emulsifies nicely and leaves the skin clean with no film, even without a second cleanse. Most importantly it doesn't clog my pores or break me out. The only problem is the price/quantity, I know it's one of the cheapest but I go through this way too quickly compared to a cleansing oil so I will repurchase when I'm feeling fancier and richer. **5/5 HG but will not buy again at the moment.**\n\n***BoJ -*** ***Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser***\n\nI love it! Cleans my skin well without leaving it stripped, has a really fun bouncy jelly texture, sometimes I lathered it on my hands creating a really soft foam, other times I just slap it on my face. Very pleasant herbal smell, no artificial fragrance or essential oils. The only downside is packaging, I prefer pumps for cleansers. I want to try Isntree's green tea cleanser as well, but I could see myself always using this. **5/5 WRP.**\n\n***Rovectin - Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser***\n\nIt's fine. It might be too hydrating for me, after I wash my face I feel like I tend to get oily much faster compared to my other cleansers. It has a little bit of a scent, reminds me of when you enter a pool during winter, but it doesn't bother me. I love the packaging, super convenient, and it's very gentle, I can wash my face how many times I want without aggravating redness and inflammation, so I will finish the 2 bottles I have. I think people with dry skin searching for a gel cleanser would love this. **3/5 WNRP.**\n\n***Isntree - Green Tea Fresh Toner***\n\nNow this is difficult, I'm supposed to love this given my skin type but I have a few gripes. I think it did help me manage oil production but I was expecting more from the soothing/calming claims, I saw none of that on my acne. I also didn't find it as hydrating or refreshing as I was expecting, but I still enjoyed my time with it. I absolutely love green tea so the sensorial experience was amazing, I think I might give it another go next summer (maybe with the emulsion as well). **3.5/5 MRP.**\n\n***Isntree - Onion Newpair Essence Toner***\n\nWatery, but a little more viscous than your average one. This one truly helped me when I was super irritated, it was very hydrating and I saw immediate reduction of redness, especially when I used it for DIY sheet masks. However despite the good results, I can't use it regularly because it's a little bit too much for my oily skin and it always dries with an annoying sticky finish, so I would recommend this to people with combo/drier skin. **3/5 WNRP.**\n\n***Naturie - Hatomugi Skin Conditioner***\n\nAh it breaks my heart, it's watery and light, packs a punch of hydration, makes my skin super soft... but it makes me shine like a disco ball after barely 30 minutes. I gave it to my sister who has a normal skin type and isn't as oily. **2/5 WNRP.** (T\\_T)\n\n***Isntree - Chestnut BHA 2% Clear Liquid***\n\nTough one, I love the blurring and smoothing effect I get with this but at the same time I struggle to understand if I'm too sensitive for 2% BHA leave on products. The morning after I use it, I often get some worsening of spots and after these months I still don't understand if it's purging, simply bringing out to the surface what was clogged, or if it's irritation, sighs. So unfortunately I can't rate this.\n\n***COSRX - Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence***\n\nI do get the hype truly, the most hydrating and plumping product I've ever tried. I love the way it makes my skin look and I also felt the anti-inflammatory effects. There is only one problem, I don't understand if it breaks me out. It's hard to figure out when you always have active acne, but I suspect the lovely film of glow it creates actually clogs me and creates the tiniest pustules and little bubble-like thingies on my pores. I will probably still finish it because I'm not 100% sure if it's the culprit, the \"break outs\" are super small and go away immediately and I love the benefits it gives me. **Need more trial or am just in denial/5**\n\n***BoJ - Glow Serum: Propolis + Niacinamide***\n\nToo thick and viscous for my liking, also dries with a sticky finish that annoys me. This is the only propolis product that I've tried and I was very underwhelmed, I didn't see the soothing/calming benefits that so many people attribute to this ingredient. Maybe it's my skin or Boj's formula, either way the only things this gave me were hydration and glow, which fair enough it's in the name, so I'd definitely recommend it to those who seek glass skin. As an oily gal this is too much for me and I have other priorities (acne). **2/5 WNRP.**\n\n***Pyunkang Yul - Calming Moisture Barrier Cream***\n\nAh cystic acne city. I was looking for a ceramide product light enough for oily skin and I can see why it's recommended, it's light with a lovely texture (closer to a gel than a cream) and absorbs decently but unfortunately it made me realize that my skin absolutely loathes fatty alcohols and fatty acids like Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate etc. **0/5 WNRP.**\n\n***Pyunkang Yul - Calming Moisture Repair Balm***\n\nDitto, same problems as above but little did I know, there is also another ingredient here that breaks me out a ton but I didn't recognize it at that time. I use this cream on my partner's thighs after work out irritation, because it is calming and soothing for those that don't struggle with my issues. **1/5 WNRP.**\n\n***ILLIYOON - Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel***\n\nDrum roll, it's squalane. This moisturizer gave me the worst skin of my life, I actually felt gross just by looking in the mirror. At least the product taught me that it's not only about comedogenic ingredients but texture and finish matter as well. This never absorbed, it always left this wet, so oily on me, film that kept aggravating my acne, I will try to finish it on my body despite my hate for it. **0/5 WNRP.**\n\n***iUNIK - Centella Calming Gel Cream***\n\nIt's basically water but not very hydrating, so I feel like it really doesn't do much and it evaporates before the ingredients actually have an effect. Also sometimes it left a weird sticky film with it, not to mention that other times I felt an itching sensation so maybe I'm reacting to something? Fragrance? **1/5 WNRP.**\n\n***SKIN1004 - Madagascar Centella Soothing Cream***\n\nFinally light at the end of the tunnel! I love this one, the perfect gel consistency for my skin, not too watery and not too thick, it absorbs very fast without leaving any stickiness. I was a little worried about the fatty acids and alcohols but thankfully they must be at a concentration that I can tolerate. I feel the calming benefits and it doesn't add any shine, so far I think it's truly the first moisturizer that I like and doesn't aggravate my issues. **5/5 WRP.**\n\n***Beauty of Joseon - Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics***\n\nMy gateway into asian beauty. Like many I had no idea sunscreens could feel so nice and light, it was love at first sight. Another super popular product so I feel like I don't need to say much, for my oily skin it became too heavy once summer came, but it's still a great product I would wear most of the times. **5/5** (WNRP just because I found skin1004 and there are way too many releases that tempt me).\n\n***SKIN1004 - Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50+ PA++++***\n\nEveryone knows it right? It's super light, spreads like a dream and absorbs quite quickly. No white cast but I'm very fair and it has a radiant finish that might not suit everyone's taste. My go-to moisturizer whenever I'm out of the house, it's so conforting that at the end of the day I feel like my skin actually improved a little. I would prefer if it had a velvet or matte finish (curious to try the haruharu wonder I bought), but it's so perfect for everything else that I just powder my t-zone. **5/5 HG already stocked up.**\n\nWow that was long! Thank you for reading and sorry about the typos or mistakes, english is not my first language.",

So sometimes i can't really have a say for all oily skin types either for certain products. Because of this, i would let my friend with similar skin concerns as yours to test out new products and see if she'll like any of them. And when she does like something, then I would recommend the products to other people with oily skin type 😂\n\nThis was a great read. I also 100% agree on the Illiyoon ceramide gel and iUnik centella gel cream. I have very similar experience with them as yours. However your review on the naturie Hatomugi skin conditioner was pretty unexpected. It's not that it was an incredible toner for me or anything cz it didn't seem to do anything for me. But then the part where it exacerbated your sebum was something that I've never heard before. So yeah, that was interesting to me. \n\nAs for the Cosrx Snail Essence, it's a HG of mine for dehydrated skin. But once my skin has healed from dehydration, i just use less of the product. Because the product alone is actually way too heavy for oily skin in hot humid climate.",

So many hyped products leave a thick film on my skin that never absorbs and ends up breaking me out. It’s interesting because my bf and I can try on the same product, and his skin (normal/dry) will absorb it within minutes while it just sits on top of my skin. \n\nI love the Isntree Green Tea Cleanser and highly recommend you try it out! I’ve been using it as my cleanser for the last few months and will 100% restock when I run out. It’s so creamy, smells amazing, lathers well, and leaves my skin hydrated but clean. \n\nI also really love the Haruharu Black Rice Wonder Toner. One of the only hyped products that has actually worked for me. It absorbs perfectly into my skin and leaves me with a nice hydrated glow, and I swear it also exfoliates lightly. For my night routine I layer this with the exfoliating serums I use (lactic acid or azelaic acid, depending on the night) and finish with Naturie Hatomugi Gel, another super light and refreshing layer that dries very down quickly.",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml. Available in 45ml,  200 ml tube and  500 ml pump bottle.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above. Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), 🌟[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, 🌟** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price.

I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

I get stingy sometimes and stop using it some days but I really miss the effect I think it gives me. I’ve tried several other ones and none have really given me that feeling, so who knows. Maybe it’s psychological? The other product that I’ve been using quite recently (maybe 2 weeks at the very most) is the Missha long name ampoule and I think this also gives me a very brightened complexion. I keep saying “ohhh my skin looks very clear and bright” to myself and I’m very happy with it! I got it for $20 on SweetCorea when I noticed here in the US it retails for $50...",

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn’t look like there’s any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven’t tried it yet but I plan to so I’ve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

So I changed it up and my go-to is now Farmacy Green Clean, which I love. Both are great, but I feel GC does a better job at overall removal for me and agrees with my oily skin type. Also the scent is just lovely. I am intrigued though by the Body Shop Chamomile though, I didn't even know they had that. So I might give it a try after using up my current supply.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

I hate it when something works really well for me and they go reformulate the whole thing. The money spent is no joke either.\n\nI realized too late and already applied it on my whole face without patch testing first so... we'll see how it goes\n\nSo far though...\nConsistency wise, new formula is a bit more watery compared sa old na very thick. \n - New feels a little lighter and less greasy vs. Old thats heavier to the point that u can feel it on you even on the back of my hand.\n - Maybe it could be a good thing with the PH weather. Cant say if the new one is less moisturizing yet but comparing them on my hands, Old formula is more slippery/greasy, new one feels a little matte thats slightly greasy if that makes sense?\n\nScent wise, theres a subtle difference but new one is still unscented.\n\nI'll update in maybe a week and see how it goes. Hopefully it still performs the same and nothing happens to me lmao. So far naman I'm not itching yet lol\n\nHere are the ingredients for comparison!\nTLDR the little search I did: \"One of the former occlusives used was Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, which was replaced by much lighter, less occlusive emollients like ethylhexyl stearate and dicaprylyl carbonate.\" + Added Madecassoside\n\nOLD\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Stearic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arachidyl Alcohol, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA(Ceramide PC-104), Polyacrylate-13, Arachidyl Glucoside, Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Polyisobutene, Glyceryl Caprylate, Panax Ginseng Root Water, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Cholesterol, Bupleurum Falcatum Root Extract, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Glucose, Silica, Glycine Max (Soybean) Oil, Ceramide NP, Phytosphingosine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopherol, Canola Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\nNEW\nPurified water, butylene glycol, glycerin, ethylhexyl stearate, dimethicone, dicaprylyl carbonate, behenyl alcohol, stearic acid, palmitic acid, cetyl ethylhexanoate, hydrogenated poly(C6-14 olefin), 1,2-hexanediol, arachidyl alcohol, C14-22 alcohol, cetyl-pigmentohydroxyethyl palmitamide (ceramide CPP-40 7622 ppm), polyacrylate-13, mannitol, arachidyl glucoside, C12-20 alkyl glucoside, hydrogenated polyisobutene, glyceryl caprylate, ethylhexylglycerin, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, hydrogenated lecithin, ethylhexyl palmitate, Dimethiconol, Ginseng Water, Carbomer, Sorbitan Isostearate, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Gold Extract, Propanediol, Cholesterol, Silica, Plum Extract, Arachidic Acid, Black Soybean Oil, Squalane Madecassoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Pentastearate, Tocopherol, Ceramide NP (4ppm), Oleic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Pentylene Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Canola Oil, Rosemary Leaf Extract",

I used it side by side one day and the side with the new formula didn’t feel as heavy and the finger swipe wasn’t as greasy.\n* I’m not sure if its viable as a morning moisturizer now, but I did use it as such under my Omi Sunbears Sunscreen. \n   * I avoided using this sunscreen when I damaged my skin barrier as it dried so matte it made my skin so dry and my old moisturizers *(Hyaloo and Klued)* weren’t enough for it.

    "body": "So, here’s the tea guys. Dry skin is tough to handle. It took me a year to find a routine that doesn’t cause flaking/eczema triggers on my sensitive, dry skin. I thought I’ll share it with you guys. \n\nHere it goes:\n\n**Step 1: Use an Ultra Gentle Cleanser**\n\nThe idea is to take as little as possible of the skin’s natural oils and give as much hydration to the skin as you can. Take less, give more. \n\nHere are my recommendations for the most gentle cleansers I’ve ever used:\n\n*1. CleanseMe-*\nThe gentlest of the lot. The love of my life. Sounds extreme? Maybe. I was using cetaphil prior which has SLS, and had no idea it was causing so much havoc until I switched cleansers.\nSo cleanseme is a 5/5. WRP\n\n*2. Episoft-*\nIf cleanseme is too gentle, I go for this. This is just an ounce more drying, and the price is a little higher. Hence I’m giving it 3.5/5. \n\n**Step 2: Use a Hydrating Toner:**\n\n*1. The Face Shop Chia Seed Hydro Toner:*\nSimple as it gets. No actives, no niacinamide. My eczema can’t take actives, I just want hydration.\n4/5, cuz it is expensive.\n\n*2. TonyMoly Mochi Toner:*\nIt’s one of the best for dry skin, no frills. \n4.5/5.\n\n**Step 3: Use a Hydrating Serum:**\n\n*1. Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Serum:*\nThis is like a drink of water to my skin. The main ingredient is Hyaluronic acid with a lot of other soothing ingredients. Love. 5/5\n\n*2. Pulp Date Night Glow Serum:*\nPulp has really cringe IG marketing, I get that. However, I was just browsing and a sale was going on. I checked the ingredients of this serum, holy moly. Ceramides and panthanol, Hyaluronic acid, a lot of goodness, in a very decent price. I got it for 500, was very worth it. 4/5. \n\n**Step 4: A THICK Moisturiser:**\n\n*1. Sugandha Calendula Oat Cream:*\nSaved my eczema. If you could think of all the ingredients beneficial to eczema, they’ve added them. Hemp seed, calendula, squalene, Shea butter, everything. It’s heavy, it’s greasy but it works. 100/5. \n\n*2. Innisfree Green Tea Seed Cream:*\nWill work for dry skin in summers. Very expensive though. 3.5/5. \n\n**Step 5: Use a Mineral/Physical Sunscreen**-\n\nHere me out. I have nothing against chemical sunscreen, however they do trigger my eczema I cannot change this. To which I have resorted to this physical sunscreen:\n\n1. *Innisfree Tone Up Sunscreen*-\nSole reason is that it is physical. 4/5\n\n*2. Requil Sheer Zinc Tinted Sunscreen*-\nSunscreen with a tint, perfect for those no makeup days. 3.5/5, due to the weird undertone. \nMake sure to double cleanse when wearing sunscreen. \n\n**Step 6: Use a Cleansing OIL**\n\nMakeup removal is tough for dry skin. Balm cleansers have a ingredient called Ethylhexyl palmitate which is the devil for eczema. Avoid strictly. I also can’t swipe micellar water on my face (except eyes and lips) because it will literally crack.\nUse a cleansing oil instead. My pick is -\n\n1. *Sugandha Cleansing Oil*-\nI like this because this leaves no residue. It does not dry out the skin whatsoever. Also the small bottle lasts really long. 5/5.\n\n2. *Klairs Gentle Fresh Cleansing Oil*-\nSame surfactant as the Sugandha one, different oils. Not to be confused with the Deep Cleansing Oil by the brand, this is very gentle on the skin indeed. Available on beautybarn. 3/5, due to availability. \n\n**Step 7: Use an Occlusive (at night)**\n\nSo yes, basically slugging, but not necessarily with Vaseline. I use the following: \n\n*1. Bioderma Intensive Baume-* Coat myself in it and sleep like a baby in winters. It is a little heavy for summers though. 4/5.\n\n*2. Bioderma Cicabio+Forte-*- This recommendation was given by my dermatologist. Whenever the skin feels irritation or redness, after moisturiser at night, slug by mixing cicabio arnica creme and sensibio forte together. It is so good for soothing redness and irritated skin, also helps with skin barrier repair. 5/5. \n\n\nOkay so that’s it guys. Basic routine keeping dry skin at bay. Hope this helps. Eczema isn’t something I wish on my worst enemy, so even if this helps a single person I’d be happy.\n\n**Please feel free to add any more tips that have helped you personally with dry skin/eczema for all of us!**",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna.

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml. Max discount 30%.\n\nUsage Timeline: 2 months\n\nConsistency: It's a pink liquid. Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

Was MRP 490 for 500 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years. I'm on my second tub\n\nConsistency: White cream.\n\nUsage: I take one big spoonful, add it to half a mug of water, swirl it around till it mixes with the water, dip my hair in and leave it. I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

Sharing the product list and first impressions below.\n\nBEAUTY OF JOSEON - Red Bean Water Gel: Extremly lightweight texture, this will be perfect to use in the summer.\n\nBEAUTY OF JOSEON - Apricot Blossom Peeling Gel\n\nBeauty of Joseon AHA BHA Green Plum toner: Watery texture, I would say it is identical to the Ginseg water essence. It contains Salicylic acid and Glycolic acid.\n\nCOSRX - Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner: Lives up to the hype, feels pleasant on the skin and gives an instant glow.\n\nCOSRX - Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence: Another one that is worth the hype. I used the All in one cream version, which I liked but I already prefer the essence. It gives a glass like glow and the texture is wonderful, much less sticky than the cream.\n\nPyunkang Yul - Calming Moisture Barrier Cream: This is my holy grail night moisturizer, I already used two containers. It has a wonderful texture that sinks in fast into the skin and it has a gently exfoliating property. I looked up the ingredients on INCIdecoder and it does contain Ethylhexyl palmitate which is marked as comedogenic, however I had no issues so far.\n\nKose - Softymo Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Gel: This thing is HUGE, 210 ml for 6 euros. It will sure last me a few months.\n\nA'PIEU - Mint Scalp Hair Vinegar: I got this for my dandruff and dehydrated scalp.\n\nKUMANO COSME - Shikioriori Tsubaki Camellia Oil Hair Essence Water Feels like spraying water on my hair, no oily feeling. My hair was shiny, although I used other products too. \n\nKUMANO COSME - Reihaku Hatomugi UV Care & Moisturizing The UV Milky Gel SPF50+ PA++++ : The 250 ml bottle was 11 euros. This sunscreen is just wonderful: not sticky at all, sunk into my skin right away and had zero white cast. Not shiny either. I got this for my body, however I think it could work on the face too.\n\nKao - Biore UV Aqua Rich Aqua Protect Mist SPF50 PA++++ : This will be useful when having to re-apply sunscreen during the day and over makeup. It has quite a chemical smell when spraying.\n\nCos De BAHA - Hyaluronic Acid Serum (H120) - 120ml: The best HA serum I tried. Not runny, slightly sticky. Gives a beautiful glow instantly and the price/value ratio is just unbeatable. It comes with a pump.\n\nMary&May - 6 Peptide Complex Serum: Packaging is high quality. I cannot tell much about the effects yet but I have high hopes for this one.\n\nONE THING - Houttuynia Cordata Extract\n\ninnisfree - Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask 2X",

    "body": "So, I shared this in the Friday questions thread but thought that it merited its own post since there is still a lot of misinformation out there about mineral oil and I still occasionally see it pop up here in the subreddit depite their being [an excellent sidebar post on the subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1356nj/mineral_oil_and_its_benefits_for_skin_dont_be/).\n\nMineral oil is unlikely to\nbe comedogenic in human skin (see below.) It is [an occlusive moisturizer](http://www.skintherapyletter.com/2001/6.13/2.html) and therefore not absorbed by the skin, and is not considered an irritant, however some people may have an allergic reaction to it (allergic contact dermatitis) which is why [patch testing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/14sd25/i_just_learned_how_to_do_a_test_patch_properly/) is always important.\n\nThere is a LOT of misinformation out there on it, even within the scientific community (as seen in the link up there about moisturizers.) Inaccurate and disingenuous marketing claims about mineral oil are abundant on products, [just like with products meant to treat acne](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/absolutely-maybe/2013/09/16/blemish-the-truth-about-blackheads/). The information about mineral oil, however, is either based on completely non-scientific claims or on outdated standards of interpretation for  scientific data based on animal and human testing models.\n\nHere is a peer review journal article commenting on the comedogenicity of mineral oil (it's a short one and very easy for the layperson to read, so here is the text in full):\n\n##DiNardo, J. C. (2005). Is mineral oil comedogenic? Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, 4(1), 2–3. doi:10.1111/j.1473-2165.2005.00150.x\n\n> The  phrase,  “acne  cosmetica”  was  coined  in  the  early 1970s to describe the association between cosmetic use and acne breakouts in women over the age of  30. Cosmetic formulations at that time did contain a number of animal, mineral, and vegetable oils, as well as synthetic oils  (esters)  which  were  thought  to  clog  pores  and perhaps elicit the response. A number of methods were quickly developed to evaluate the comedogenic potential of  these ingredients, and several of  these were found to evoke a response in the rabbit’s ear. This quickly became the model of choice. Several years later, a human model was developed,  and  researchers  noted  a  difference  between the results. Several ingredients elicited less of a comedogenic response. At this point in time, a great deal of confusion in  interpreting  comedogenic  results  existed.  Both  dermatologists and those in the cosmetic industry were unsure of the signiﬁcance, if any, that the reported data held with respect to “acne cosmetica.” In an attempt to understand the contrasting results between the animal and human models, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) held an international symposium on comedogenicity.^1\n \n> Several  factors  were  taken  into  account  (methodology, experimental design, results obtained, etc.), and based on the data presented, the symposium concluded that “if the animal model does not show evidence of comedogenesis, the  test  material  under consideration  is  unlikely  to  be comedogenic  in  human  skin.  One-plus  reactions  are also unlikely to cause reactions in humans. Two-plus or three-plus responses require sound scientiﬁc judgment. Reformulation  should  be  considered  or  the  product should  be  adequately  tested  in  humans  before  general use.”  It  should  be noted  that  the  comedogenic  grades used in this statement are based on a 0 (no activity) to 3 (severe activity) scale, and that researchers were reporting results using a 0 (no activity) to 5 (severe activity) scale. Therefore,  when  interpreting  the  reported  data,  the AAD-recommended  values  would  have  to  be  shifted  to\ninclude a one-plus to a two-plus for “unlikely to be comedogenic” and grades three-plus to ﬁve-plus “would require reformulation or adequate testing in humans.”\n\n> So,  “is  mineral  oil  comedogenic?” This  is  a  question that physicians, estheticians, cosmetic marketers, and consumers have asked me several times a year for the last two decades. Looking over the animal data that have been generated over the years  (published^2–5 and unpublished)  using  the  rabbit  ear  model,  mineral  oil  elicits  a comedogenic grade ranging from 0 to 2 on a 5-point scale (Table 1).  Taking  into  account  the  AAD  recommendations, mineral oil would be categorized as “unlikely to\nbe comedogenic in human skin.”  To determine if  this conclusion could be considered accurate, a number of ﬁnished products containing mineral oil were evaluated using the human model. These products ranged in mineral oil concentration from approximately 0.5% to 30%. The  testing  was  conducted  as  outlined  by  Mills  and Kligman.^6 However, in order to avoid a subjective grading, the mean ratio of follicles to microcomedones was obtained for both pre-application and postapplication sites, and a  percent  change  from  baseline  was  calculated  to determine the degree of microcomedone formation. This\nallows the data to be expressed in the form of a percent, yielding a clearer picture of the comedogenic activity. The data depicted in Table 2 presents the percent change in\nmicrocomedone  activities  for  the  products  tested  (9–34%). The  percent  change  from  baseline  is  within  the normal range of  ±10% of the negative control (15–30%)\ntested and can therefore be considered noncomedogenic in humans. Additionally, based on the 85–95% change in microcomedone  activity  noted  for  the  positive  control\n(octyl palmitate or INCI name ethylhexyl palmitate), it would appear that this material does exhibit a comedogenic response when tested undiluted in humans.\n\n> So, “is mineral oil comedogenic?” No, based on the animal and human data reported, along with the AAD recommendation, it would appear reasonable to conclude\nthat mineral oil is noncomedogenic in humans. Will we see more products containing mineral oil in the market?  No,  marketing  claims  have  convinced  us  that mineral oil is a comedogenic ingredient and it will be far too hard for anyone to convince the consumer, after being bombarded by mineral-oil–free claims for decades, that it is now okay to use products that contain mineral oil. \n\n> What  is  the  message?  Don’t  be  fooled  by  marketing claims.  Although  it  is  very  difﬁcult  to  ﬁnd  the  time  to research the numerous claims that are thrown at us daily,\nlook for products that have been tested and claim to be noncomedogenic as opposed to just looking at the ingredients listed on the box or “ingredient x-free” statements. As  with  all  toxicological  testing,  the  effects  observed when  testing  an  actual  product  in  humans  is  the  best form  of   assessment  to  determine  potential  hazards associated with any ingredient and/or product.\n\n------------\n\n> ***Table 1*** *Reported comedogenic activity of mineral oil in animals.*\n\n>|Test ingredient/grade | Reported comedogenic activity (conc. tested)^* |\n|:-----------|------------:|\n| Mineral oil/carnation |0 (100%)| \n| Mineral oil/light |1–2 (100%)| \n| Mineral oil/medium |0–1 (100%)|\n| Mineral oil/heavy |0 (100%)|\n| Mineral oil/technical |1 (100%) |\n| Mineral oil/not specified |0–2 (10% in Propylene Glycol)|\n^*Values ^reported ^are ^based ^on ^a ^0 ^\"no ^activity\" ^to ^5 ^\"severe ^activity\" ^scale.\n\n-------------------\n> ***Table 2*** *Comedogenic potential of products containing mineral oil.*\n\n>| Product type | Mineral oil range | % change from baseline^* |\n|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|\n|Body scrub |0.5–1%|12%|\n|Foot cream |1–5%|9%|\n|Hand and body cream |5–10%|13%|\n|Facial cleanser |5–10%|33%|\n|Facial moisturizer |5–10%|13%|\n|Powder face make-up |10–25%| 8%|\n|Pressed face powder |25–30%| 34%|\n|Negative control |N/A |15–30%|\n|Positive control |N/A |85–95%|\n^*Percent ^change ^from ^baseline ^is ^based ^on ^the ^change ^in ^microcomedone ^to ^follicle ^rations ^for ^pre- ^and ^post-treatment.\n\n--------------------------\n> **References**\n>  \n> ^1 American Academy of Dermatology invitational symposium \n> on comedogenicity.

    "body": "I previously posted this post on Reddit however it was removed due to being a link to my blog post. That link on Reddit is http://redd.it/1zwi7x\n\nSo long story short. Ipsy sent out a mini (deluxe size) gloss from POP Beauty called PLUMP POUT. It was sent out in Peony Petal and Fuchsia Freesia. Unfortunately there was a manufacturing issue, which POP Beauty claims was a flavor ingredient having been left out.  This may not be the case as people have reported on various social media sites that within days of using the product their lips have been raw, sore, cracked, blistered, red or developed a rash around their mouth. Ipsy has also stated to subscribers, via email, that the glosses are safe. \n\nDue to the fact that the ingredients in the gloss is NOT what's listed on the website OR on the shrink wrap the product is essentially misbranded which violates US FDA laws and regulations. \n\nFrom the FDA \nhttp://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm241820.htm\n\nWhat to Report\n\n<i>Katz says consumers should contact FDA if they experience a rash, hair loss, infection, or other problem—even if they didn’t follow product directions. FDA also wants to know if a product has a bad smell or unusual color—which could signal contamination—or if the item’s label is incomplete or inaccurate.\n\nIf you have any concerns about a cosmetic, contact MedWatch, FDA’s problem-reporting program, on the Web or at 1-800-332-1088; or contact the consumer complaint coordinator in your area.\n\nWhen a consumer report is received, FDA enters the information into a database of negative reactions. Experts then look for reports related to the same product or similar ones. FDA scientists will use the information to determine if the product has a history of problems and represents a public health concern that needs to be addressed.\n\nIf you file a consumer report, your identity will remain confidential.<i>\n\n<i>\"Cosmetics are usually safe, but when they aren't, consumer reporting is essential so FDA can take action when appropriate,” Katz says. Those actions could—depending upon the product and the problem—range from issuing a consumer safety advisory to taking legal action.</i>\n\nIf you received a POP Beauty Plump Pout mini from Ipsy PLEASE report it to the FDA. POP Beauty has continued to delete comments from people regarding their reactions to the gloss. There have been many people posting pictures of their lips and you can see that they did not experience a normal \"allergic reaction\" but something more serious. At this time there is no way for anyone to say the gloss is safe or not safe because no one knows for sure but it's best to discontinue using it until POP Beauty can PROVE it's safe by having an independent lab test the minis from Ipsy.\n\nIpsy has no plans on making any public announcement on the matter so please pass the word to anyone you know who has the mini gloss that it's potentially not safe.\n\nThe ingredients in the minis are NOT the same as the full size. Until yesterday the ingredients on Ipsy and POP Beauty were completely different than what's on the actual full size packaging and mini packaging. \n\nHere's what's now on the POP Beauty site in regard to the full size ingredients (this now matches what's on the packaging of the full size):\n\nHydrogenated Polyisobutene (and) Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer (and) Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mineral Oil, Polybutene, Beeswax, Copernica Cerifera (Carnouba) Wax, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate (and) Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (and) Stearalkonium Hectorite (and) Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12, Ethylhexyl Palmitate / Tribehenin Sorbitan Isostearate / Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Benzyl Nicotinate, Persea Gratissima (Avocado Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin-E), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Almond) Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Extract / Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (Lavender Butter), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Seed) Oil, Mangifera Indica Seed Butter (Mango Butter), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance. [+/- Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Red 7 Lake (CI 15850), Yellow 5 Lake (CI 19140), Red 33 Lake (CI 17200)]. \n\nFrom Ipsy's site - the ingredients to the mini glosses.\n\nFuchsia Freesia: mineral oil, polyisobutylene, beeswax, disosteary malate, silica, ethyl hexyl palmitate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, ethylheyxl palmitate, silica dimethyl siliate, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, sodium, hyaluronate, caprylyl glycol, hexylene glycol, phenoxyetharol, simmondsia chinensis(jojoba) seed oil, tocopherl acetate, sambucus nigra fruit extract, fragrance [+/- iron oxides (cl 77491, cl 77492, cl 77499), titanium dioxide (cl 77891), yellow 5 lake (cl 19140:1), red 6 lake (cl 15850:2) red 7 Lake (cl 15850:1)]\n\nPeony Petal: mineral oil, polyisobutylene, beeswax, disosteary malate, silica, ethyl hexyl palmitate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, ethylheyxl palmitate, silica dimethyl siliate, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, sodium, hyaluronate, caprylyl glycol, hexylene glycol, phenoxyetharol, simmondsia chinensis(jojoba) seed oil, tocopherl acetate, sambucus nigra fruit extract, fragrance [+/- iron oxides (cl 77491, cl 77492, cl 77499), titanium dioxide (cl 77891), yellow 5 lake (cl 19140:1), red 6 lake (cl 15850:2) red 7 Lake (cl 15850:1)]\n\nAlso note that the full size is made in the US, the minis in Taiwan.\n\nIf your lips or mouth area has developed any type of rash, redness, sores or any negative experiences PLEASE report it to the FDA and if you're in Canada to Health Canada and your country's import regulators. The bottom line is they know there was a manufacturing problem but refuse to acknowledge that there was something more serious than a single flavor ingredient having been left out. The products could potentially be contaminated or have totally different ingredients than what's on the label.\n \nTo report the matter to the FDA visit: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/\n\n",

That doesn't mean you will like all of them- to think you will is silly. ~~Its why the bag is cheap.~~\n\nI understand that some people may not have appreciated the smell of the POP product, but it is disappointing to see everyone jump on the \"lets hate POP and IPSY and M. Phan\" bandwagon because POP made a flavoring mistake- and then everyone feels they deserve more free products because it smells weird (some people are now upset they didn't get TWO replacement products instead of just one) **If the product actually caused you significant harm, I understand wanting a replacement or new product- but because it smelled funny?**\n\n~~Its a cheap beauty bag for a reason~~- you aren't going to like all of the products. I don't think raising pitchforks, complaining on every single POP and IPSY networking website, and contacting the FDA **when nothing harmed you** is worth it- especially for a ~~10 dollar~~ bag where you know you aren't going to like everything.\n\n\nWhether or not the full size and sample size version of the products are the same is completely irrelevant here- other than the fact that the mini is missing a flavoring ingredient. The fact that the minis are made in Taiwan is irrelevant. I think the mob mentality needs to calm down.\n\n_________________________\nEDIT: The pricing isn't the point I am making, here.\n\n________________________\n\n(pasted from lower comments) \n\n\nYes, I did receive a strange smelling gloss. I, too, was also concerned at first- and I did my share of research, and looked up reviews on the normal size and saw that the harsh chemical smell is present in the normal versions as well.\n\n**Again, I am not saying to not contact the FDA if you actually had physical harm from the product.**\n\nBut, again, I must state that I am very against the mob mentality and the pitchforking- especially if absolutely nothing has come from the lipgloss other than a \"strange smell\" to you personally. Just because a few people reacted to the product does not mean we all need to call the FDA.\n\nSure, some people reacted to the product. It does have irritating ingredients, it is a plumper after all- and sometimes this does happen. But it wasn't a huge, wide spread disaster. Many fda cosmetic products irritate people's skin or leave rashes.\n\nAnd its strange to me that people would actually think that POP (or any company) would pretend an item wasn't toxic if it actually was, and tell its customers it was safe if it wasn't. A voluntary recall would be far better for their sales and keeping their customers than an outright lie. Why would they pretend? They have no reason to as far as sales go, or customers. For some reason people just NEED to believe its something bigger than that, and blow this thing out of proportion. \n\nI am not one to play the \"what if\" or conspiracy game. They said it was safe, Ipsy said it was safe, and it did not affect me in any negative way (other than an odd smell.) I am not going to pretend to be an expert scientist in cosmetics- that is their job.",

POP Beauty will be releasing a statement on the matter with the Plump Pouts. What it will contain I do not know. Hopefully, as I replied to her email, a statement acknowledging something went wrong in the manufacturing process, discontinue using the minis until they know for sure if the products are safe. That, as I told her, is my primary goal.\n\n>Years ago, and some of you know this from past posts of mine, I had a bad contact lens fit by an optician which resulted in permanent damage to my eyes. My right eye has a \"tear shape\" growth at the back which my last Ophthalmologist said is permanent and that it must be monitored over the years. I am not a candidate for laser surgery to correct my vision (I'm nearsighted with an acute astigmatism) and laser may not correct the growth issue.\n\n>This plus other things that have happened to me over the years causes me to be very vocal when it comes to safety concerns. I do not want to see other people harmed by something that can be easily avoided. In this case simply stating \"don't use the product until we know for sure\" is what I want to see happen.\n\n>I like the full size Plump Pout. It smells like a vanilla cupcake. It's a beautiful color and had the minis been like the full size in the first place I would have most likely bought more of those Plump Pouts. But I've said it over and over, something went horribly wrong with those minis to smell so acrid and for people to experience such adverse reactions such as cracked lips, rashes around the mouth, redness and soreness.\n\n>Once POP Beauty has released the press release or make a statement I'll share it plus give you my thoughts on the matter then.",

    "body": "Nitong nakaraang mga araw may isang Tiktok content creator ang inulan ng comments sa kanyang Tiktok page dahil diumano sa hindi magandang paraan o istilo ng pagrereview ng sunscreen na ito. Dahil dito , naisipan kong bilhin at subukan itong sunscreen na ito. \n\nUna sa lahat, binili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa tingin kong official store nitong Worada sunscreen na ito. Ito yung store na may Worada din sa pangalan. Dito din sa store na ito binili nung content creator na binanggit ko kanina. Yung B1T1 na yung binili ko, yung isa sa usage test, yung isa naman e sa gagawin kong test sa lab. May kasama din pala itong freebie na Whitening Antiperspirant and Deodorant Cream (isusunod ko itong i-review). \n\nSimulan ko muna sa packaging. Yung packaging nito ay 50 g Cosmetic Pouch with spout. Ito ay gawa sa BOPP/VMPET/LLDPE/Aluminum Foil na sinadya para maprotektahan ng husto ang laman na sunscreen. Ito yung isa sa mga usual na material na ginagamit sa paggawa ng mga cosmetic pouch. Makikita din sa packaging na gawa pala ang Worada Sunscreen sa China. \n\nHindi ko nakita sa packaging ng sunscreen na ito yung mandatory warning para sa mga sunscreen na dapat present sa mga sunscreen products na binebenta sa ASEAN: Do not stay too long under the sun, even when using a cosmetic product. \n\nSa paggamit naman. Pagkabukas ko pa lang ng sachet nitong Worada sunscreen, naamoy ko na agad yung fragrance nito. Amoy milky floral ang fragrance na ginamit dito. Ang laman na sunscreen ay isang cream na off-white na may hint ng dilaw ang kulay (mas maputi ng kaunti sa evap na gatas). Kapag inilagay na sa daliri, nagbe-break na agad ang emulsion at nagiging matubig o runny, kagaya nung sa video review. Noong ipinahid ko ang 2-finger lengths nitong sunscreen, una kong napansin e masyadong maputi yung sunscreen para sa skin tone ko. Tinagalan ko na ang pagbe-blend nito sa buong mukha at leeg ko, pero sa huli halata pa din ang whitecast. Nasabihan pa nga ako ng kasama ko sa lab na nagsusumigaw yung sunscreen ko sa mukha. \n\nNgayon sa ingredients naman. Ito ang ingredients nitong Worada sunscreen:\n\nMilk, Aqua, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide, Glycereth-26, Potassium Laurel Phosphate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Isohexadecane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate-80, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Niacinamide, Trehalose, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Parfum\n\nUnahin na natin ang UV-Filters. May tatlo na UV-Filters ang Worada Sunscreen:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \n\n* Ethylhexyl Salicylate (UVB) \n\n* Titanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nBabalikan ko ito mamaya para mai-relate sa product claim nitong sunscreen. \n\nAng pinakaunang ingredient sa IL nito ay Milk. Maling entry na naman. Lac (Milk) ang tamang INCI name kung naglagay ng gatas as ingredient. \n\nRelated naman ang gatas sa susunod kong punto. Gumamit ng Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, at Propylparaben itong sunscreen na ito bilang preservative system. Angkop itong preservative system na ito, dahil ang taas ng ginamit na Milk sa formulation na ito. Nararapat lang na broad spectrum preservative system ang gamitin. \n\nPreservative Efficacy:\n\nParabens: Yeast and molds; Gram(+) bacteria\n\nPhenoxyethanol: Yeast and molds; Gram(-) bacteria\n\nRegarding sa safety ng parabens (methyl, propyl), approved for use pa yan ng regulatory bodies ng ASEAN at EU, basta masunod lang ang maximum allowed concentration. Pakitingnan na lang sa pic yung statement ng SCCS, ang committee na inaatasan ng EU na magsagawa ng safety assessments ng mga ingredients kagaya ng parabens. Pero kung isa ka sa mga nakakaranas ng contact dermatitis dahil sa pagiging sensitive ng iyong balat sa parabens, mabuting iwasan na lang ang mga produktong gumagamit nitong mga preservatives na ito. \n\nSunod, may laman naman itong mga ingredients na moisturizing sa balat: \n\n* Glycerin (humectant) \n\n* Trehalose (humectant) \n\nPara naman sa whitening:\n* Milk\n\n* Niacinamide\n\nMay antioxidant din: Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nSunod nating tingnan ang product claims ng Worada sunscreen:\n\n* SPF 60 PA+++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\n* Invisible\n\n* Waterproof\n\n* Sweat Resistant\n\n* Lsolate Skin (nasa harap, di ko naintindihan kung anuman ito) \n\n* Whitening\n\n* Moisturizing\n\nSa SPF claim, hindi ko mawari kung papaano nasabi ng brand na ito na may UVA protection ito, samantalang yung tatlong UV-filter nito e puro UVB protection ang kayang ibigay. Dagdag pa, wala pa akong nakikitang SPF test report para sa Worada sunscreen na ipinakita ng brand owner sa kanilang soc med accounts. Kung meron man, makikicomment na lang sa baba. \n\nSa claim na invisible, hindi naman invisible e. Kitang kitanang white cast e. \n\nSa water proof claim, hindi pwede ang water proof claim. Water resistance ang tamang ilagay jan. At kailangang may patunay na tinest ito, kesyo ito ay 40 min or 80 min water resistance. Ganoon din sa sweat resistance. May test din para jan, either 40 min o 80 min, kagaya ng water resistance. \n\nYung Lsolate Skin na claim na nasa harapan, malay ko jan. Kailangang i-clarify ng brand owner yan. \n\nSa claim na moisturizing at whitening, meron namang ingredients na laman ang sunscreen para masabi kahit papano na pasok ang claim nila. Ang concern ko lang e yung paggamit ng Milk. Matumal ang mga studies kung sa nakakapagpaputi ang gatas. Tapos, takaw-mikrobyo pa yan. Mabuti na nga lang, ginamitan ng broad spectrum preservative system. Pero kung mahina ang preservative system nito, madaling masisira ang product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nMarami akong concerns na nakita sa product na ito. Una na jan yung kung SPF-tested ba talaga ito. Pangalawa yung claim na may UVA protection, pero malabo base sa mga UV filters na ginamit. Ikatlo, yung mga unallowed (water proof) at unsupported (water resistant at sweat resistant) claims. Yang tatlo na yan, major red flags na agad dahil hindi tama na magki-claim para sa product na hindi pa naman nagtetest. Palaging tandaan, sa mga product claims, laging dapat may kaakibat yan na substantiation. Kasi napakadali gumawa ng product claims, ang mahirap e patunayan kung tunay ba talaga yan. Performance-wise, hindi para sa akin itong sunscreen na ito, dahil ayoko ng whitecast. \n\nAbangan ang Part 2 para sa mga isasagawa kong mga test sa lab. \n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbasa. \n",

    "body": "This isn't a new product (to me or the sub) but I rarely see it talked about, so I figured I would give it a review. I've been using this cleansing oil on and off for about 18 months.\n\n**Skin type:** I'm in my 30s, and my skin is generally oily (formerly dehydrated/oily), but has recently become a lot more dry due to the dry winter weather and prescription tretinoin use. My primary skin concerns run a wide gamut - I'm focused on anti-aging because of my age, but I also have acne, clogged pores, PIH, and melasma. My skin is very, very clog prone. Basically, my skin is a \"special snowflake\" that thinks the world should tremble in fear.\n\n**Location/weather:** I live in the Mid-Atlantic area of the US, so the weather is hot and humid in the summer, and cold and dry in the winter.\n\n**Other first cleansers I have tried:**\n\n* Heimish All Clean Balm\n* LJH Dr's Care Cleansing Oil\n* Whamisa Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil\n\nI have also, in the past, tried traditional OCM with mineral oil. It did not go well (lots of clogs), and in general, I now try to avoid cleansing oils with mineral oil in them, hence why I haven't tried some of the more popular cleansing oils on this sub. The LJH Dr's Care also contains mineral oil, and also didn't go over well with my skin.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review.\n\n**Ingredients (copied from Ulta.com):** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Water, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Black Sugar Extract, Sodium Pca, Betaine, Threonine, Sorbitol, Proline, Lysine, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Alanine, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Serine, Glycine, Alcohol Denat., Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceramide Np, Sarcodon Aspratus Extract, Sucrose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta.\n\n**Price:** This oil cleanser is easily found on tons of websites. I most often buy from Amazon, and pay about $14-15 USD for a 200mL bottle.\n\n**Smell:** This oil smells *strongly* of lemon, with the faint hint of sugar. The smell is very noticeable on application, but once the cleanser is rinsed off, it dissipates completely. I happen to like the smell, but others may find it a little too reminiscent of Lemon Pledge.\n\n**Texture:** This cleansing oil seems rather thin - it seems to be slightly thinner and less viscous than vegetable oil. Sometimes this is annoying, as I have to use a little more oil than I'd like to really massage my face well without pulling my skin (3 pumps or so).\n\n**Cleansing Power:** In my opinion, this oil cleanser does a fantastic job with face makeup and sunscreen. It does not excel with waterproof eyeliner and mascara - it will remove some but not all waterproof eye makeup. I, however, do not like to use this on my eyes. I wear contact lenses and it always causes them to get milky, making it difficult to see. The cloudy residue lasts several hours. I do not know if this would impact someone who doesn't wear contacts. However, with face makeup and sunscreen, as well as with some superficial clogs, this oil cleanser does a great job. I sometimes, but not routinely, feel grits coming out of my skin. It does not help break up deeper clogs or closed-head blemishes.\n\n**Emulsification:** This stuff turns pretty darned white when mixed with water. I make sure to rinse all traces of it off my face so I don't see any of the cleanser, especially near my hairline. It emulsifies and rinses off easily, and doesn't leave any feeling of residue on my face. I always follow with a second cleanser, but I do not feel a film or greasiness with this cleanser. It also doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry - just clean.\n\n**Overall:** I really like this cleanser and have repurchased it many times. At the price point, it does what I need it to do. It breaks down the face makeup (Mac Studio Fix Fluid or Estee Lauder Double wear, topped with Innisfree powder) and my sunscreen (La Roche Posay Ultra Fluid). It rinses cleanly, and it is inexpensive and easy to find. I don't expect **any** cleanser to address aging concerns, or to meaningfully use acids. Any claims of brightening from a cleanser are probably worthless, since the product isn't on your face long enough to do any meaningful chemical exfoliation. This cleanser is best at what it does not do: it doesn't create new acne for me and it doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nIt is probably not my favorite of all oil cleansers. Right now that would be Whamisa, which is great, but expensive, and which also doesn't seem to penetrate pores as deeply as the Skinfood cleanser. Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil is a great choice that I will probably continue to buy it, especially since it's easy to get in the United States. I think it's an excellent pick for a first cleanser that isn't based on mineral oil, but only if you are not sensitive to fragrances.",

    "body": "Hello folks! So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before. But it's the FIRST affordable product that I came across that has high % of niacinamide AND  Acetyl glucosamine ---- not just those, but a small amount of supposedly the most powerful vitamin c derivative!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide and NAG work synergistically together](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/n-acetyl-glucosamine-nag) to be a brightening powerhouse as well as repairing your skin barrier. They help boost your ceramide production and NAG is skin-identical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**PHYSICIANS FORMULA SKIN BOOSTER - BRIGHTENING**](https://www.target.com/p/physicians-formula-skin-booster-vitamin-shot-brightening-1-fl-oz/-/A-75569193)  **$7.99/1 oz or 30ml**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Glycerin,\\* ***Acetyl Glucosamine***\\*, Pentylene Glycol, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Disodium Edta, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate,\\* ***3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid***\\*, Iron Oxides (Ci 77492), Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Vegetable Collagen, Agar, Calcium Alginate, Xanthan Gum, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tropolone, Gluconolactone, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Red 30 (Ci 73360), Sodium Benzoate.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like it's an \"inspired\" product of [**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-niacinamide-booster/798.html)**:**\n\n*Water (Aqua),* ***Niacinamide*** *(vitamin B3, skin-restoring ),* ***Acetyl Glucosamine*** *(skin replenishing/antioxidant),* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside*** *(vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).*\n\nThe Paula's Choice obviously has more beneficial ingredients and higher % but still, it's **$44 for 0.67oz/20ml**.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it’s pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin. So I started mixing it with my moisturiser and things were good !\n\nBefore this I have only used Sugandha vit C which I also liked and Minimalist 10% vit C which did nothing for my skin.",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

The reason I'm posting a comment because I saw so many people say they won't because of the packaging, and I honestly don't mind the packaging. I know the tube packaging is more convenient but I think I won't mind using my fingers and wipe off extra product on the side of my eyes, because look at the ingredients. It's got ceramides and its spf 30. We can wash our hands you know, they don't have to be dirty or unhygienic. I apply all my skincare with my hands. We don't have applicators for everything. So why does lipbalm bother people so much? I have been using the cosrx lipbalm which also comes in a tub and I've honestly gotten used to this kind of packaging. At this price and these ingredients I would overlook the packaging. \n\nPlus these tubs are recyclable. I can reuse them to put other products, like facewash that remains inside the tube packaging which doesn't come out, instead of throwing away the tube I cut it off at the bottom and store the product in these tiny tubs, because there's honestly a week's worth of product that goes to waste, and it can't be left open because it will dry out. What would I do with the chapstick packaging, I'll just have to throw it out and it can't be reused. It just goes in the trash, and I doubt it ever gets to a  recycling facility in a small town like mine.",

Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

In the BoxyCharm Premium box the high price item ****possible spoiler if you haven’t gotten your December box but it’s crap anyway***** is the Avant Supreme Hyaluronic Acid Antioxidising DUO moisturizer. They claim this item is worth $134 and it would be if it had the actual ingredients in it that the true product does. From the Avant website (where it is on sale for $87) these are the true ingredients:\n\nAllantoin, aqua (water), ascorbyl palmitate, caprylic/capric, triglyceride, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl, glucoside, cetyl alcohol, chlorphenesin, CI 17200 (D&C Red No. 33), CI 42090 (FD&C Blu No. 1), citric acid, dimethicone, dimethicone crosspolymer, ethylhexyl, palmitate, ethylhexylglycerin, lecithin, maris aqua (sea water), ozokerite, parfum (fragrance), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, phenoxyethanol, potassium cetyl phosphate, propylene glycol, Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, sodium hyaluronate sodium polyacrylate, sorbitol stearyl alcohol, tocopherol, xanthan gum.\n\nThe first few on the BoxyCharm version in order are: Aqua (water), caprylic/capric triglyceride,ethylhexyl palmitate,cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone, sorbitol.......you get the picture\n\nSo from now on if you are a BoxyCharm customer I’d encourage you to check your ingredients against the manufacturers website to see if they are just giving you garbage to try to make it sound like you are getting an amazing deal.",

I've tried mint and peach and prefer the mint. Great lip product and I've used a lot. Some favorites being the Laneige Lip sleeping mask, Bite Agave Nectar Lip mask, Dr. Dan's Cortibalm, and C.O. Bigelow My Favorite Night Balm. This is one of the more affordable options out of the ones listed and it's amazing! Very very hydrating as someone who suffers with severely dry lips. It makes my lips feel like butter. Has some great ingredients like ceramides, green tea, panthenol. Very mild fragrances just enough to notice when applying but almost like it's unscented after it's on your lips for a few minutes. I'd say it's a medium consistency not too thick and not too thin just enough of a barrier. Really recommend if you've had trouble finding a great affordable everyday lip product. If you're having trouble finding it at a CVS you can buy it from peachandlily.com \n\nHere's the full ingredient list for anyone who's interested/has allergies:\nDiisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Ricinus Communis (castor) Seed Oil, C18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearoyl Stearate, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate/hexastearate/hex Arosinate, Helianthus Annuus (sunflower) Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Isostearate/dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer, Meadowfoam Delta-lactone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dextrin Palmitate, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Phytosteryl/isostearyl/cetyl/stearyl/b Ehenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Beeswax, Fragrance, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Panthenol, Persea Gratissima (avocado) Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide Np, Titanium Dioxide, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (wheat) Sprout Extract, Camellia Japonica Leaf Extract, Eruca Sativa Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Medicago Sativa (alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (broccoli) Sprout Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, Tocopherol, Blue 1 Lake (ci 42090), Yellow 5 Lake(ci 19140)",

    "body": "I've been lurking around in this sub for quite some time but I had yet to contribute to it. Now, the time comes. \n\n\nFirst of all, I'll tell y'all my skin type so you get an idea of how these two products may work on you. I have sensitive combination skin, it was originally very dry but with summer my T-zone is starting to get oily. I have a little fungal acne (self-identified though, I never went to pro for this) and rosacea type 1. I redden really easily and my veins show up, my skin breaks out easily at products or even... my computer or phone screen. I'm a computer science major. It's a review but if someone got some tips it'd be nice >>' \n\n\nLet's go for the review! \n\n\n**Muji Light Toning Water (High moisture)** \n\n* Ingredients: Water, DPG, glycerin, PEG-32, diglycerin, glycosyl trehalose, hydrolysis hydrogenated starch, hyaluronic acid Na, allantoin, grapefruit seed extract, polyquaternium -51, purslane extract, BG, phenoxyethanol, PCA-Na, Na-citrate , citric acid\n(Fragrance free, Non-staining, Mineral oil free, Mildly acidic, Paraben free, Alcohol free) \n\n* Packaging: Some may find it cheap/too simple but I like the minimalistic style! \n\n* Application: It feels like water, only a bit thicker. Because of that, it's very easy to apply with cotton, patting with the tips of your fingers or making a mask soaked with it. It's a pretty light product and my skin absorbs it quickly! The scent is pretty mild too. \n\n* Benefits: It does a good job at hydrating my skin without breaking it out and the pH is very close to the one of our's skin so it feels good after using a cleanser. It made my face plump and soft. \n\n* Price: It's affordable but I find it on the pricier side for a student without many resources (France's price). The benefits are there but they're 'WOW' either, but I recommend it for those who use 7-skin/layer method. \n\n* Overall: A solid 4/5 \n\n\nMuji's toner made me trust the whole sensitive line as the ingredients are few and look fine. Totally safe, right? So I bought that moisturizing milk as my skin is very dry and the toning water is not sufficient. \n\n\n**Muji Moisturizing Milk (High moisture)**\n\n* Ingredients: WATER,OLEA EUROPAEA (OLIVE) FRUIT OIL,DPG,GLYCERIN,PEG-32,ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE,PENTYLENE GLYCOL,GLYCOSYL TREHALOSE,GLYCERYL STEARATE,SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS (JOJOBA) SEED OIL ,HYDROLYZED STARCH,PEG-75 STEARATE, BEHENYL ALCHOL,POLY SORBATE-80,ALLANTOIN,POLYQUATERNIUM-51,PURSLANE EXTRACT,CITRUS GRANDIS(GRAPEFRUIT) FRUIT SEED EXTRACT,CARBOMER,ARGININE,BG,XANTHAN GUM,TOCOPHEROL,SODIUM ACID CITRATE ,PHENOXYETHANOL\n\n* Application: The scent's a bit stronger than the one of the toning water, some say it smells like glue and I agree. Still, it's mild and doesn't bother me. As for the texture, it's quite sticky and I felt like it just sat on top of my face. Depending on your skin type it may give you a glowy effect for the whole day or make you look like you bathed in oil— for me it was the second case. It should be used as a night moisturizer just before sleeping. If you rub the part where the milk is applied it becomes...chalky? Powdery? Kind of like when you rub a sunscreen with strong white cast. \n\n* Benefits: I was very disappointed. After using the moisturizing milk for three days my skin broke out and I spotted acne on my forehead and the skin around my nose was clogged. The break out wasn't very strong though, I think it's a good product for those with very very dry skin and without fungal acne issues. I looked up on Cosdna and saw that Ethylhexyl Palmitate is an ester which feeds the yeast on your face so... No good for fungal acne. \n\n* Price: Same as for the light toning water, it is a bit expensive in France and affordable in US. \n\n* Overall: It's not a bad product and I feel like it may be good for other people, however, the texture is sticky and feels greasy. For the price, I advise to try something else and avoid it completely if you have fungal acne or oily skin. 2/5 \n",

    "body": "I was on the search for the perfect fragrance free oil/balm cleanser for quite some time. I love to do double cleanse to make sure I remove all the sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of first cleansers/cleansing balms so I thought I would do a quick review here for anyone who is interested. My standards when it comes to a good cleansing balm/oil: fragrance-free, effective, but gentle on the skin, doesn’t over-dry the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone.\n\nAll the products I buy and review here completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing, potentially irritating plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus). So here we go:\n\n**Versed Gentle Cycle Hydrating Milky Cleanser:**  **•**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water/Aqua/EauOlea Europaea (Olive) Fruit OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed OilPropanediolVitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed OilGlycerinCaprylic/Capric TriglycerideMusa Sapientum (Banana) ExtractMagnesium Aluminum SilicateLactobacillus Ferment LysateSclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed OilAvena Sativa (Oat) Kernel ExtractRubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit ExtractLeuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment FiltrateTocopherolCitric AcidSodium Lauroyl SarcosinateXanthan GumEthylhexylglycerinSodium BenzoatePotassium SorbateSodium Hydroxide\n\n**My thought:** This product has a milky texture that is easy to use, effective and also gentle on the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes, but there are a few things to note: 1/ It doesn’t spread very far on the skin so you have to use quite a lot of product to cover the entire face so the bottle doesn’t last very long. 2/Even though the product is fragrance free, there’s a light banana scent due to the banana extract in the formula. So if you’re not fond of the banana smell, you might not like it.  Overall, it’s a great , gentle formula and one that I might repurchase.\n\n**Updated review (11/10/22): I recently repurchased this product again and noticed there are little grainy particles like sand in the product. I'm not sure what they did to the product but my sensitive skin can't tolerate scrubs or any physical exfoliant so I won't be using or repurchase this product again.**\n\n**Good Molecule Instant Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polyethylene, PEG-8 Isostearate, 1,2-hexanediol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Citric Acid.\n\n**My thought:** This product used to be only available in the scented version (loaded with potentially irritating essential oils), but due to customer demand, they decided to make a fragrance free version (thank you very much). I’m not sure if the scented version is still out there, so make sure you check the ingredients carefully before purchasing. This product come in a tub with a small spatula that you can use to scoop up the product. I do like this cleansing balm, I think it’s very effective and a little goes a long way. You don’t need to use much to cleanse the entire face. It’s also gentle enough to use around my eyes without any irritation. One con I can think of about this product is the smell. Even though it’s fragrance free, it has a chemical smell that is quite strong which I guess comes from one of the raw ingredients in the formula (though I’m not sure which one exactly). I think some people might find it unpleasant, but it’s still better than adding fragrance or essential oils.\n\n**The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Laurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**My thought:** This product has a cream texture that is quite thick coming out of the tube, and once it’s on the skin, it does require a lot of massaging, then the texture changes to oil as you work it in. Even though it’s gentle on the skin, I find it a lot less effective than other products on this list. This is not a product I would recommend for someone that wears a lot of makeup or doesn’t like to take a long time removing makeup at the end of the day. Even if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, I think there are better products out there. Personally, I wouldn’t repurchase it because: 1/It requires too much rubbing and effort to make it work. 2/I find it does irritate my eyes a little. 3/you have to use a lot of product to cleanse the entire face and the tube doesn’t last very long.\n\n**The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n**My thought:** This product comes in a tube, similar to the packaging of the ordinary squalene cleanser, but the texture is different. It comes out of the tube like petrolatum jelly. Because it’s quite thick, it doesn’t spread very far, so you have to use quite a lot of product to cleanse the entire face. It’s gentle on the skin and eyes, and leave my skin very soft afterward, but I think it will not work well for someone that wear a lot of makeup. I consider myself a minimal makeup wearer and this product couldn’t remove my eyeshadow completely. I also notice that the texture of the cleanser is not completely smooth, it’s slightly grainy due to the small pieces of oat which I do not like. I will not be repurchasing this product.\n\n**Jordan Samuel Skin The After Show Treatment Cleanser for Sensitive Skin:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Aqua/Water, Sucrose Laurate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobiliss Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**My thought:** This has to be the worse balm cleanser I have ever tried. It has a jelly-like texture coming out of the tube, and it goes on the skin just fine, but it just doesn’t cleanse off when I rinse my face with water. It barely remove makeup and leaves my face with a layer of residue that feels oily. I feel like I have to follow up with another cleanser right away or risk breaking out. I hate wasting product but I couldn’t make myself use this one so I threw it out after trying a few times. Sadly, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbeth-30 Tetraisostearate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olive Fruit Oil, Water, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate (Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), Jojoba Seed Oil, Ceresin, Dextrin Palmitate/Ethylhexanoate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, BHT\n\n**My thought:** this product is a very popular Japanese cleansing oil, and for a good reason. It’s affordable, cleanses quickly and effectively, without leaving any residue behind. 2 pumps are what needed to cleanse my entire face. If you’re someone that wear a lot of makeup and need something that can remove make up fast and effortlessly, you will love this product. Some cons about this product: 1/ it can bother my eyes sometimes if I get it too close to the eyes. I thought i just throw this out there in case anyone has super sensitive eyes. 2/ It might be hard to get in in store. You have to order it online and it might take some time to arrive.\n\n**Isnt Tree Micellar Melting Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Sap , Opuntia Ficus-Indica Seed Oil , Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Squalane\n\n**My thought:** This is a liquidy cleansing oil that comes in a pump bottle. It’s thin in texture and gentle, but effective. It’s also non irritating to the eyes, and rinses off well. Compare to the hada labo, it’s a thinner oil, and I have to use more product than Hada Labo to cleanse my entire face. I need 3 pumps for Isnt Tree as opposed to only 2 pumps for Hada Labo. If you are deciding between the 2, I would recommend Hada Labo. It’s just as effective if not more, the bottle lasts longer, and more cost effective as well.\n\n**Purito from Green Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Vegetable Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**My thought:** This oil cleanser come in a pump bottle similar to the ones from Hada Labo and Isnt Tree, but the texture is thicker than the other 2 brands. It’s effective, but gentle and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I need about 3 pumps to cleanse my entire face. Overall, it’s a good cleanser but I still prefer the Hada Labo because it’s cheaper, works just as well, and the bottle lasts longer.\n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient solvent), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate (emollient cleansing agent), Diisooctyl Succinate (emollient), Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters (emollient cleansing agent/emulsifier), Trihydroxystearin (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (emulsifier), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant).\n\n**My thought:** This one has a balm like texture coming out of the tube and spread easily on the skin. There’s no residue left behind after cleansing. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn’t sting my eyes and is also effective. It has no discernible smell, which is nice since some fragrance-free products can still have an unpleasant smell due to the raw ingredients used in the formula.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-10 Isostearate, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Seed Water, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Water, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**My thought:** This is the most recent product that I've tried and is my current favorite. If I have to choose only 1 balm/oil cleanser to use, this would be the one. It replaces my previous favorite cleansing balm from Paula's Choice. The texture is smooth and gentle on the skin. It spreads more easily than Paula's Choice's and has no detectable scent. \n\n**Other plain oil options I’ve tried that work well:** When I run out of my balm cleanser and haven’t purchased a replacement in time. I usually use plain oils to remove my makeup. But because plain oils do not contain emulsifier, they don’t come off with water, so I have to immediately follow up with a water based cleanser to rinse off the oil residue on my face. Here are 2 oils that I like to use:\n\n**Coconut oil**: thicker oil, best for people with normal to dry skin\n\n**Jojoba Oil:** thinner in texture than coconut oil, best for oily and combo skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Top 3:** \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser**\n\nIf you have a favorite oil/balm cleansers that are not on this list, please share with me in the comment :)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "This is so cool! I love seeing people as committed to zero fragrance/irritants as I am! I'm definitely going to keep these in mind for reccing balms in the future since I don't usually mess with those.\n\nFor context, I'm dry skin and sensitive + acne prone, plus have keratosis pilaris. A cleansing oil I would highly suggest to try out is\n\nKOSE SPEEDY cleansing oil. Here is the current ingredient list https://incidecoder.com/products/kose-speedy-cleansing-oil\n\n you'll see a lot of different listings since they reformulated a lot but this is the right one. \nIt is a very light, well emulsified oil that rinses cleanly and doesn't overstrip. Spreads very well. Doesn't leave a residue. It is even good as a solo cleanse! This is my default recc for any skin type or with any condition. I have people with rosacea, eczema, and ichthyosis using it so I'm very confident in its gentleness. In the US, there's 1pack 7.8oz for $13 or 2pack with 1 full and 1 refill for $20 on Amazon. Some have mentioned being able to find it at Daiso stores in US and other countries. \n\nSo this second one I've only used for a week but I begrudgingly have been pretty into it as I'm more on the dry side. It's the Neutrogena lightweight body oil fragrance-free https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/body-oil-fragrance-free/6861830.html\n\nIt's a very low-viscosity watery-freling oil and it has good spreadability. Works really well at getting into pore for that deep but gentle clean you want from oils. It's probably the gentlest one I've tried even more so than my DIY sunflower/grapeseed + Polysorbate 80 I've made. The \"problem\" is that the Neutrogena oil does not rinse well at all. However I think it might good alternative for people who have tried other oil cleanser and found the emulsifiers just made it too much for their skin but don't want to use a pure oil. It does mostly come off with the gentle second cleanse. It will leave a bit behind in your skin, but as someone dry I quite appreciate that slight buffer for the cleanser and it hasn't caused any issues or broken me out. My skin does actually feel quite a bit more comfortable and less dry since introducing this when this was the only change. It does feel decently nourishing without being overwhelming. It definitrly lives up to its claims if used this way. Normal price is $13 for 8.5oz but can be found for $9-10 on sale sometimes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but my skin has already decided it likes this, so... 😒\n\nAs my gentle water-based cleanser, my current favorite is the Pipette baby wash and shampoo fragrance-free https://www.target.com/p/pipette-baby-shampoo-wash-fragrance-free-11-8-fl-oz/-/A-79503241. I get a lot of funny looks when I recc this but it's genuinely the best thing I've found that is on par in gentleness with some of the better non-foaming cleansers like the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser and is more affordable. It has amazing spreadability and you don't need a lot. I have gone through 4 bottles and am about to repurchase because I'm too hooked and it's insanely cost effective compared to most facial cleansers. Normal price is $8 for 12oz, it's commonly on sale for $6.50ish and one time I caught it for $4 so I stocked up hard. But I'd be happy paying $8. I also use it for body and hair so 😳 I felt it was worth mentioning since it's the second cleanse I follow with.\n\nI'm definitely gonna be taking a look at more of your content now as well!

Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product? My wallet and I thank you in advance.**",

I was using these for the first time, and I was expecting to get tanned, even though I applied it regularly. I was a bit surprised that it saved me from tanning.\n\nI didn't feel any cooling sensation as such, but it did the job of protecting against tanning, no white cast and didn't even pill. For low price, it was a pretty good buy.\n\n**Repurchase:** WRP\n\n**2) [Vitamin C + E Super Bright Sunscreen SPF 50+++](https://www.nykaa.com/dot-key-vitamin-c-e-face-sunscreen-with-spf-50-pa/p/13199519?skuId=8380668&se=0)**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 445 for 50g (Got 2 D&K sunscreen for Rs. 374/- from firstcry during Fomo sale)\n\n**🥵Climate:** Currently using in humid summer heat \n\n**Texture:** Watery fluid\n\n**👃Fragrance:** Claims to have none.\n\n**Claims:** 100% No White Cast\n\n**🧪Ingredients:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Glyceryl Citrate/Lactate/Linoleate/Oleate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta Vulgaris Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Terminalia Ferdinandiana (Kakadu Plum) Fruit Extract, Citrus Sinensis (Blood Orange) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid \n\n**My Experience:** I'm currently using this Sunscreen, mostly for reapplication.I also apply it on hands for reapplication. \n\nIt has pretty much protected me from tanning, but the only problem is that it pills if not blended properly. \n\nI know you might say all sunscreen pills if not rubbed or applied properly, but I've used many sunscreen, which even when applied in rush, didn't pill. Can't say the same for this sunscreen. \n\nIt's not sweat proof or water proof, and can burn your eyes if you accidentally rub them before the product seeps into your skin. I wouldn't recommend it for oily skin too, as it feels greasy.\n\nThe product does its job of protecting against sun, but I haven't been out for longer hours after applying it. Plus, reapplying it while being out under the sun might lead to pilling. The positives are that it has no white cast, is affordable and might work for dry skin.\n\n**Repurchase:** No\n\n\n",

I can't shut up so prepare for this to be long.\n\nSkin type is dry-to-normal (I think I was incorrect in my previous post lmao). Prone to acne, blackheads, and hyperpigmentation. My main skincare goals are to heal hyperpigmentation, stay spot free, and do preventative anti-aging.\n\nI try not to spend more than £20 on any one product, but there are a couple of more expensive products in this routine. Prices are what I normally pay in Boots or direct from the manufacturer; exceptions are noted.\n\n**Routine summary**\n\n*Morning (generalised):* foaming cleanser --> exfoliator --> vitamin C serum --> 20 minute wait --> toner --> antioxidant serum --> moisturiser --> sunscreen\n\n*Morning (products):* Simple Micellar Gel Wash --> Drunk Elephant TLC Frambroos --> Hylamide C25 --> 20 minute wait --> Facetheory Cera-C toner --> Inkey List Q10 --> CeraVe Moisturising Lotion --> SunSense Ultra + Burt's Bees lip balm and/or Aquaphor\n\n*Evening (generalised):* cleansing balm --> foaming cleanser --> toner --> retinol serum --> moisturisng serum --> moisturiser --> facial oil\n\n*Evening (products):* The Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Balm --> Simple Micellar Gel Wash --> Facetheory Cera-C toner --> Indeed Labs Retinol Reface --> The Ordinary Buffet --> CeraVe Moisturising Lotion --> The Wild Rose Soap Company Face Serum\n\n*As needed:* Calamine & Glycerin cream (spot treatment), Burt's Bees lip balm, Aquaphor\n\n**Morning routine & reviews**\n\n*Simple Water Boost Micellar Gel Wash -* £5/150ml; key ingredients: gentle surfactants, panthenol\n\nI love this product. Definite repurchase. It has a really nice texture, it's slightly acidic, and it foams + removes easily. No scent at all which is my preference. I got it to replace the Boots Expert Sensitive Face Wash with Aloe Vera, which is slightly alkaline and was causing serious breakouts, scaly dry patches, and a raw red patch on my cheek; as soon as I switched cleansers my face started healing.\n\n*Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum -* £76/30ml; key ingredients: AHAs, salicylic acid, 12% combined concentration\n\nOkay, so serious caveat here: I received this as a gift from a friend. It was already open and I'm not sure how long it had been open for, so if I'd got it new I might have a different opinion. Having said that, I do not like this product. The packaging is neat (you twist the top and a little spout pops up to push down on), and I like the gel texture, but it is not nearly as effective as other exfoliators I've used. It makes my blackheads smaller, but does not eliminate them the way I would expect, especially from a luxury product. My budget does not stretch to £70+ skincare, but even if it did, I would not buy this again. Before this I was using The Ordinary 7% Glycolic Toner (£7) and a Neutrogena toner (£5) layered on top of each other for better results at literally a fifth of the price. (The Neutrogena toner, btw, DID get rid of my blackheads. Although it appears to be discontinued now, because we can't have nice things.)\n\n*Hylamide C25 -* £25/30ml; key ingredient: vitamin C (ethylated ascorbic acid), 25%\n\nAs far as results go, I like this product. I feel like it makes my skin glowier, and has helped fade PIH; not dramatically, but it's definitely helping. It's a little more expensive than I ideally like to spend on serums, but you only need a quarter of a dropper each time so it's going to last months. BUT - the propanediol base feels very sticky and petroleum-oily, and it lasts even after the rest of my routine. It's especially difficult to apply make up over, and gums up my make up brushes. And somewhat concerningly, it was scentless when I opened it, but with time has started to develop a slight \"burnt corn\" (I don't know how else to describe this) smell despite being stored in a shut cupboard in a cold room. I think it's still fine to use - I haven't experienced irritation or breakouts - but it's definitely not the \"completely stable\" formulation that Deciem claims it is. I would reluctantly repurchase this if I couldn't find anything better, but I'm going to seek a vitamin C serum that has equivalent results and a less annoying texture. Next on my list is the Inkey List Vit C + EGF serum.\n\n*20 minute wait*\n\nNot a product, but I definitely think that leaving a 20 minute wait after my low pH products has helped them work better. Definitely think I'm glowier since I started doing this! Can be hard to fit in in the morning; I normally use the time to eat breakfast in. (NB - Hylamide C25 doesn't have a traditional pH as it's a water free formulation, but in water ethylated ascorbic acid has a pH of 3 - 5 so I treat it like a low pH product.)\n\n*Facetheory Cera-C Toner -* £15/200ml; key ingredient: niacinamide, 5%\n\nMy main interest in incorporating this product into my routine was the niacinamide. It also has ceramides and a little bit of vitamin C, but I'm not so fussed about that. And it's fine! Perfectly nice toner. No scent, slightly viscous, slightly oily texture but not in a bothersome way, goes on best with fingers rather than a cotton pad. You only need a few drops each time so the bottle lasts forever. Pleasantly soothing after cleansing. There is nothing wrong with it and if it were the only toner in the world I would happily repurchase it indefinitely, but as is I'm getting a little bored. Going to try the Muji Toning Water or Hada Labo Hyaluronic Acid Lotion next, and get niacinamide in a separate serum.\n\n*The Inkey List Q10 serum -* £5/30ml; key ingredients: antioxidants, especially Q10\n\nThis is a lovely little serum. No scent, goes on easily with fingers. I don't notice a major change from this, but then I wouldn't expect to from an antioxidant serum. It's slightly moisturising and I do think it helps support my sunscreen and prevent further PIH. And it's a great price. The only thing wrong with it is that the packaging is very irritating; I normally store it upside down or I can't get the product out. Really needs a pump or something (I suspect the Niod pumps would fit so some Frankensteining might be in order). I've repurchased it a couple of times but I've realised that the Niod Survival 0 serum is only £20 (i.e. within budget) and has a much more exciting antioxidant profile, so I'm going to try that next. If you have £5 rather than £20 for a serum, then this is definitely a good option.\n\n*CeraVe Moisturising Lotion -* £9.50/236ml; key ingredients: ceramides, fatty alcohols\n\nI know this sub is all about CeraVe in the tub, but can we have some love for CeraVe with the pump? This is light, nourishing, and just gorgeous. No scent, no fuss, and no getting your grubby fingers in the product. Sinks in easily and sits well under make up. Possibly not *quite* heavy enough for the nighttime, but that's what facial oils are for. I often layer this on my lips as well. Have repurchased this once already and intend to do so again. One day I might want to play around with other moisturisers for variety and to satisfy my curiosity, but honestly I'll have trouble setting this aside.\n\n*SunSense Ultra -* £23/500ml from The Suncare Shop; key ingredients: niacinamide, SPF 50 (I used to get this for £20/500ml but it's gone up, boo)\n\nI am not about all these tiny fiddly sunscreens in 50ml bottles that will create mounds of plastic waste, especially as I use sunscreen on my body as well as my face. SunSense Ultra is a runny milk that sinks in easily, and one 500ml bottle will last me almost a whole year. It isn't sticky once it's on, but I do still notice it if I'm paying attention and it occasionally escapes into my eyes (although I do put it on my browbone underneath the eyebrow). I vastly prefer it to any drugstore sunscreen I've tried and have repurchased before. However, now Alturist comes in 200ml bottles I'm going to switch to that - Altruist is the best sunscreen I've ever tried and feels like nothing once it's on. I've long kept a 100ml Altruist bottle in my gym bag, but didn't want to make it my go to sunscreen and go through tons of plastic bottles. Bigger bottles means that Altruist is going to become my everyday sunscreen.\n\n**Evening routine & reviews**\n\n*The Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Balm -* £11/90ml\n\nThis is fine. It's a cleansing balm. Sometimes I get grits with it which is cool. Has a nice, silky texture which is good for an oil massage. I'm struggling for anything else to say about it - honestly it bores me. The main ingredients are ethylhexyl palmitate and synthetic wax which are the most boring ingredients imaginable. I'm going back to Lush Ultrabland - it's more expensive, but that almond oil+beeswax mix is much more enjoyable and nourishing.\n\n*Simple Water Boost Micellar Gel Wash* \\- as above\n\n*Facetheory Cera-C toner* \\- as above\n\n*Indeed Labs Retinol Reface* \\- £20/30ml; key ingredients: retinol, hydroxypinacolone retinoate (AKA granactive retinoid), palmitoyl oligopeptide, palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7\n\nI... think I like this? I'm not sure if it's making much of a difference to my face; the fine lines on my forehead (I'm 27 so they are very fine) seem like they're softening a little, but not much. I got better results with The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% but I didn't really want an oil format anymore. I do like that this one is mild enough to go all around my eyes, but part of me wants something stronger. I might repurchase, but I'd like to try a few more retinoids first and see how it goes. There aren't many well-reviewed retinoids out there for £20 or less though - recommendations welcome.\n\n*The Ordinary Buffet -* £24.10/60ml; key ingredients: amino acids, several forms of hyaluronic acid, sugars, urea, glycerin, PCA, oh yeah and I guess some peptides\n\nGiving the price for the larger size because that's what I buy because I love this. It's so good. It smells (faintly) like glue but I really could not care less because there is so much good stuff going on in here. I guess it's technically an anti-aging peptide serum, but that's not what I'm here for: I'm here for that good good moisturisation. Buffet really excels at that.\n\n*CeraVe Moisturising Lotion* \\- as above\n\n*The Wild Rose Soap Company Face Serum -* £12/30ml; key ingredients: squalane, grapeseed oil, cacay oil\n\nThis is a facial oil. It says it's a \"face serum\", and if you consider oils serums then that is accurate. But I would call it an oil. Moving on - I picked this up on a whim when buying shaving soap from the company, and I like it a lot more than I was expecting. The base is grapeseed which gives it a very light feel, and it smells faintly nutty (I guess from the cacay oil). It's pretty moisturising, and if it were available on the high street I would repurchase - but I don't like it enough to make a special order from the company each time. Intending to replace with Facetheory's Q10 oil.\n\n**As needed reviews**\n\n*Burt's Bees Lip Balm -* £4 each\n\nWhat is the point of this product. It leaves my lips no more moisturised than Vaseline. I got it as a gift and I hate it. Not sure if I'll even use it up. Next up for me is Nuxe Reve de Miel or Dr Pawpaw depending on how flush I'm feeling.\n\n*Eucerin Aquaphor* \\- £9/45ml; key ingredients: petrolatum, lanolin, panthenol\n\nI tried this after reading about it on The Acid Queen Blog and... I love it. It's so much better than Vaseline. It's fine on lips (especially over a different moisturiser), but I think it really shines on small wounds and especially on damaged cuticles. My cuticles are prone to being flaky nightmares and this has really helped me fix them. I also used it as an occlusive layer when I was fixing my skin from the Boots Expert face wash, and it really helped heal my red, sore skin. I balked at the price at first, but this tiny bottle has lasted me several months thus far. Going to rebuy forever.\n\n*Calamine & Glycerin cream -* £1.60/35g; key ingredients: zinc oxide 5%, calamine, glycerin\n\nA while ago everyone on this sub was buzzing about nappy cream and other high zinc oxide creams for spots, and I happened to see this in Boots so thought I'd give it a shot. Friends. It's so good. I put it on active breakouts and it brings the inflammation and redness right down. It's occlusive and high in glycerin, so it doesn't dry out or irritate the skin surrounding the spot; it just works. Especially effective on whiteheads which it dries right out. When I have an active whitehead, I dab a thick layer on right before bed and wipe off any reside in the morning. I also put a thin layer on shaving rash, which it works wonders on too - I think it would do well on any inflamed skin. And it's one. Pound. Sixty.\n\nAnd now for a bunch of stuff that isn't pictured.\n\n**Tools**\n\n*Reusable cotton rounds -* I cannot remember where I got these from or how much they cost but I like them a lot. They have a somewhat scrubby surface that exfoliates wonderfully. Nothing in the above routine requires them, but I miss them; I need to find something that works with cotton rounds!\n\n*Facetheory bamboo cloths* \\- £7.25 for 3 - I tried some cheaper face cloths and they were inadequate. These are good. Very good. Especially after a few washes when they get delightfully soft.\n\n**Body care**\n\n*Bioderma Atoderm Nourishing Cream* \\- £18.50/500ml - my current body moisturiser. I use it daily. It is great. Hasn't 100% cleared up, but definitely very much helped, the keratosis pilaris on my arms. The pump is efficient. The price is reasonable. It does exactly what I want a body cream to do without making a fuss.\n\n*Bioderma Atoderm Shower Oil* \\- £8.80/200ml - I've never used a shower oil before so this has very strong novelty value. It's quite fun, but I feel like I'm getting through it quickly and it's kind of pricey. Going to switch back to regular shower gel.\n\n**Hands and feet**\n\n*CCS Foot Care Cream* \\- £8/175ml - I put this on my feet every night before I go to bed and it helps keep the hard skin at bay. It has 10% urea which I think is a major part of this, as well as lactic acid.\n\n*Footner Exfoliating Socks* \\- £20/pair - for when CCS is not enough! Every couple of months my feet spend an hour in this bag of alcohol and acid, and then over the next week all the dead skin peels off. It's gross and satisfying and gives me beautiful feet. I've tried a few cheaper options; Footner still reigns supreme.\n\n*Sweet almond oil -* £5/100ml from Holland & Barrett - I put this on my cuticles when I get out of the shower and rub it in. It's moisturising and good and helps prevent my cuticles returning to hangnail hell. I was using squalane which I think is slightly better but also several times more expensive; so I'm going to stick to the almond oil.\n\n**Shaving**\n\nI'm currently using a double edge razor with Gillette Platinum blades. I still get some shaving rash though. :( For shave soap I have *The Wild Rose Soap Company Fragrance Free Shaving Soap* (£8/130g), and I don't rate it. It doesn't foam up as much as I'd like and even though there's water in it there aren't any preservatives?! This gives it a preposterously short shelf life, which I think it's already surpassed even though I haven't used all that much of it. I suspect this is contributing to my shaving rash, which has been getting worse recently; I'm likely to throw it out and try something else. Probably going to keep the tin and put a different brand's shaving puck in there.\n\nSomething which does help is *Lifeplan Aloe Vera Gel* (£8/200ml). I apply it immediately after shaving and before the Bioderma, and it helps soothe the skin.\n\n**Haircare** (scalps are skin, right?)\n\nI'm using a cheap misc shampoo from Boots which I don't like much and will replace when it runs out. My hair's quite short so conditioner tends to make it quite limp; instead I'm using *grapeseed oil* (£4/100ml from Holland & Barrett). I slather on a good handful before washing it, and then add just a few drops immediately after washing when my hair is still wet, massaging it all through my scalp and hair. Keeps it soft and happy.\n\n**Mindfulness**\n\nNot a product, but I don't think this is an aspect of skincare that gets discussed enough. I use my evening routine as a time to do mindfulness meditation, and focus very deeply on the sensory experience of doing skincare. The sound of running water. The feel of my hands on my face. The different colours in the packaging of my products. If my mind drifts, that's okay; I simply bring it back to my routine when I can. I definitely feel better for it - even though it's only 5 or 10 minutes a day, doing it regularly gives me a core of tranquility and peace. There is so much evidence that mindfulness is good for you, and if you've never tried it then I strongly recommend you do.\n\nIf you got to the bottom of this then well done you! I hope it was useful. I enjoyed typing it even if no one reads it. :D",

I am so bad about wearing sunscreen, because I absolutely loathe the feeling + smell. It is so sensorily unpleasant and distracting. These look much more tolerable. Sadly they seem difficult to get in the US.\n\nFor shaving cream — have you ever tried the hair conditioner trick? I feel like this has been floating around on those “Stripper Beauty Tricks” threads forever. I thought it would irritate my skin, so I didn’t try it until about a month ago. But holy shit, it works! Closest shave I’ve ever gotten and super cheap, too. \n\nI am using [this](https://www.garnierusa.com/about-our-brands/fructis/triple-nutrition/triple-nutrition-conditioner) Garnier Triple Nutrition conditioner. I wouldn’t use this on my actual hair; honestly, I chose this just because it was on sale for like $2 at the time. I think it works just because the slip is so good. Normal shaving cream or butter or whatever doesn’t remove as much of the friction of the razor on my skin, thus exacerbating my skin’s complaints. I have fast-growing black hair so I shave most every day. The conditioner experiment has made it a slightly more tolerable process. (Although watch out — it does make the shower floor more slippery. Rinse thoroughly.)\n\nFinally, I love the point you bring up about mindfulness. I’m just recently getting back into skin care after a looooong hiatus. I haven’t settled into a routine long enough to see physical results yet, but the self-care aspect of it has been immediately gratifying. It honestly feels like an indulgence, and I like the ritual. Going to try to incorporate a little mini meditation within these minutes as well.",

Unfortunately, it always remained a little tacky on my skin (I have this with every foundation though) but it only played nice with Laura Mercier setting powder it would start to separate with anything else. So, I think this foundation is really dependant on skin type. The good news is Myer sells it, so you can get a sample. \n\nMaybelline is okay, I used the Fit Me range for years but I got tired of really having to buff it in for it to look good on me. The shades were always just slightly off for me. But I used it as that’s what I could afford then and it was long lasting and look good for most of the work day. So, it’s decent, but wouldn’t be my first choice. \n\nMy preference is to MAC, their foundations are great, buildable and I’ve used all sorts of setting powders on top with no issues. RCMA loose no colour, Maybelline FIT ME pressed powder, Laura Mericer Loose powder, Coty Airspun, By Terry Hyaluronic - it works with everything.",

Exact same situation, I'm still using up a bottle of Bourjois Healthy Mix Serum Foundation in colour 53, recently went to repurchase because the bottle is starting to feel empty.... Unfortunately faced with the news that this has been discontinued for a long time now! :( I have been doing some research and reviewing the ingredients list of the new Bourjois formulations with help from chatGPT..\n\n\nHere is what it says about the new Dropper Bottle Healthy Mix Serum:\n\n\"The new dropper version is not a perfect dupe of the old Healthy Mix Serum. It's:\n* More modern-feeling (thin, skin-like, less silicone-heavy) \n* Better for sensitive/dry skin due to lack of alcohol \n* Still radiant and skincare-infused, but with a different texture philosophy (from creamy-gel to dry-touch serum). \nIf you're chasing the old formula's smoothing, creamy-silicone feel, this won’t fully match it—but it's a nice evolutionif you like a lighter, skin-like serum foundation.\"\n\n\nAnd then about the Healthy Mix Tinted Beautifier\n(https://bourjois.fr/products/embellisseur-teint-healthy-mix-medium-clair-3616303011147):\n\n* \" Starts with dimethicone, just like the old formula. \n    * Contains PEG-10 Dimethicone, glycerin, and Disteardimonium Hectorite (same thickener as in the original). \n    * Has fruit/plant extracts, tocopheryl acetate, and ascorbyl glucoside—comparable to the original’s vitamin-rich “fruit therapy” blend. \n    * Maintains that lightweight, silicone-serum feel. \n* Downside: May be sheerer than the original foundation, but the base feel is the closest.\" \n\nI'm thinking of ordering the tinted beautifier based on this analysis, has anyone tried it?

    "body": "I've tried many SPF lip balms over the years.  My biggest complaint is that so many are less than SPF 30 and some are not even broad spectrum.  Why insist on SPF 30 for your face but use something less on your lips?  Lips receive UV exposure too and are a common place to get skin cancer.  \n\nAdditionally, I found that many SPF lip products have a \"chemical taste\" and/or irritate my throat.  So I started excluding ones that contain avobenzone (which I suspect, but am not certain, is responsible for this).\n\nHere is a review for three that I've used that met my requirements.  Photos are at the end of the post.\n\n**Elta MD Lip Balm SPF 31** Active Ingredients: 7.5% Octinoxate, 5.0% Zinc oxide.  Inactive Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol,  Lauryl Laurate, Purified Water, Flavor, Polyethylene, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cera Alba, Glycerin, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Glyceryl Behenate, Microcrystalline Wax, Quercetin, Thiotic Acid, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Hydrolyzed Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Glyceryl Stearate, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum.\n\nContains antioxidants Vitamin C and E.   This has a vaguely minty scent, though it contains no mint or other flavoring.  I would not repurchase this because I don't like the oily base that it is in.  It comes out of the tube as a soft solid, but turns very oily on my lips.  The result is a very glossy appearance and some of the product gets into my mouth. The fact that it melts when hot worries me; I fear the ingredients may separate and no longer be evenly distributed (for example, if you keep it in your pocket). The tube specifies that it should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 103 degrees F.  Leaves my lips lighter and very glossy (see picture at the end of the post).  Price is $10 on Dermstore for a 0.28 oz tube.\n\n**Cotz SPF 45 lip balm**  Active: Titanium Dioxide 4.0%, Zinc Oxide 5.5%.\nInactive: Alumina, Aluminum Hydroxide, Aluminum Stearate, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Cetearyl Isononanoate, Dicaprylate-Caprate, C12-15 Alkyls Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Hexadecanol, Hexadecyl Laurate, Iron Oxides, Ozokerite, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Flavor.\n\nThis is a physical sunscreen lip balm that is tinted brown.  Yes, brown.  The brown tint works surprisingly well, though I wish they'd come out with a pink option as well.  I don't find this to be drying at all. Contains antioxidants Vitamin C and E.  It smells a bit like candy, but the scent dissipates quickly.  Tastes how it smells, but only if i lick my lips.  I've gone through several tubes of this because I like it so much. It holds up fine in my pocket, though the label always gets rubbed off eventually.  Looks brown on lips but not overly so (see picture at the end of the post). I've purchased on the Cotz website, as well as on Dermstore.  It's about $6-7 for a 0.14 oz tube.\n\n**Ultrasun UltraLip SPF 30**  Ingredients: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, PEG-8 Beeswax, Cera Alba, Cocoglycerides, Cyclopentasiloxane, Candelilla Cera, Ceresin, Dipropylene Glycol Dibenzoate, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Cyclohexasiloxane, Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether Benzoate, Lecithin, Copernicia Cerifera Cera, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butyrospermum Parkii Extract, Aroma, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Oleate, Citric Acid.\n\nThis is a European product, so the percentages of active ingredients are not listed out.  We can see it contains octinoxate, Tinosorb S, and Uvinul A.  Contains antioxidants Vitamin C and E. Contains blackcurrent and meadowfoam oils. Because of the UVA circle, we know the PPD is at least 10, or equivalent to PA+++.  It says it contains aroma, but I smell nothing.  It feels like a regular lip balm, has a very nice texture and no taste at all.  I am not sure yet if it is drying (the weather is getting colder here, so it's hard to tell).  I purchased it on Feelunique and it's $7-8 for a 4.8 g tube.  I like it so far and would purchase again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/riyNr).",

This is not fungal acne safe though!\n\nINGREDIENTS:  Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sorbitol, Panthenol (11,000ppm), Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Ceramide NP, Madecassoside, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tromethamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Disodium EDTA, Sorbitan Olivate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I thought: This essence has been a lovely addition to my routine. It makes my face very soft and mochi-like! It has a thick texture, and is milky white. I use a coin sized amount and then spread it on my damp face and neck - in the morning after my thermal mist and in the evening after I come out of my shower. It doesnt smell of anything and doesnt leave a residue or make my face sticky. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jyuhhjwyn5n81.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7241214aae40d8bab4eb15863bf70c5cd5b90517\n\nHow I use it in the morning: I use my thermal spray to mist my face ----> Make Prem Panthenol essence----> Astral cream\n\nIf anyone would like a review on the make prem sleeping pack or Romand lip tints let me know in the comments.",

I’ve had GREAT results so far with my below routine using a BHA in the morning and an AHA at night. I also do a 40% lactic peel weekly and a few days after I use the Antec Mask + ACV if I feel like it. My skin has become way more clear and smooth, but I want to work on my fine lines and discoloration as well, which I feel like my current routine isn’t really touching much.\n\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM:\n\nCeraVe Hydrating cleanser or just wipe off face with clean warm cloth.\n\nStridex in the Red Box – I keep this on while I’m driving to work (10 min drive) and then sanitize my hands and continue my routine.\n\nCeraVe AM + extra sunscreen.\n\nCover FX Powder Foundation – Also looking for a critique on this product.

I don't know if that means anything for your skin, I've just never seen it in foundation before.\n\nThe only ingredient I'd worry about is the silicone. Do you use primer too? Most people who use a silicone based foundation use a silicone based primer if they use a primer. That could potentially clog pores. Otherwise it seems fine ingredient wise, but someone else might know a little more about the other stuff.",

This one and Dr Jarts black label bb cream are the only two that didn't look flakey/cakey. However, Dr Jarts was almost too moisturizing and clogged my pores a bit. Most foundations/moisturizers break me out, but the CoverFx cream didn't. They do have lots of colors so I'd get some samples if I were you. It has amazing coverage and will eliminate need for concealer for most people. Powder tends to be drying but I haven't tried the one CoverFx makes.\n\nAlso, dusting powder on your face may irritate it more and increase redness, so cream applied with a disposable sponge may be more suitable for your skin.",

Hence, requirement #4.  \n\nBut, I am still including a list of lip balms with essential oils, just in case the research doesn't pan out, or the amounts included are really small.  Personally, I'd prefer to avoid photo-sensitizing essential oils in SPF lip balm.   Also, limonene seems to be very common in these lip balms... [here is a paper](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02269653#page-1) on limonene - as it oxidizes, it can produce compounds that are contact allergens.  OK.

While I do have \"breakout prone\" skin, it's typically never on my forehead. I didn't attribute it to the cleansing balm at first, but after about a month of using it, I finally(!!) realized that the balm was likely the culprit. I did some googling and realized that this balm has ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE in it, which is a 4 on the **comedogenic** scale.\n\nTwo questions for you all:\n\n1. Have you had similar experiences with cleansing balms breaking you out? Any specific experiences with Juno 10?\n2. How long do these kind of breakouts typically last? I stopped using the cleansing balm about 20 days ago, and while I'm noticing the forehead breakout is improving, I am still getting new little zits that I'm not used to seeing. Is this just previously clogged pores going through their cycle and I should get some relief soon?",

    "body": "I’m going to be honest; I never quite used sunscreen on my lips until a month ago. At the beginning of last year, I learned to religiously apply sunscreen in the morning and reapply after two hours in the sun. I gently smoothed it over my face, and rubbed it on my arms, legs, and the back of my hands. I was the subject of judgmental stares during swim season as I would be the only dude who applied sunscreen on his whole body, rather than just his face and shoulders. I made sure every part of my body that would see UV light was coated in a liberal layer of protection. Every part except my lips.\n\nGranted, my lips were always on the dry side, so I applied some SPF 15 Chapstick every now and then. But it was not broad spectrum. \n\nDo not neglect your lips! Skin cancer on the lips is not impossible (http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/lip-cancer-not-uncommon). Furthermore, UV rays will certainly thin the skin on the lips and accelerate aging. And, worst of all, while 94% of 299 beachgoers were cognizant of the risks of UV damage, only 69% demonstrated an awareness of the risk of lip cancer.\n\nThe best part about protecting lips is that it’s so fast, easy, and cheap. A few glides of a $3 balm, a quick smushing of the lips, and they’re protected. However, *reapplication should be much more frequent*, because the sunscreen can be rubbed off when eating and drinking.  \n\nHere are some recommendations to get started. These are some of my favorites, but there are certainly many more options:\n\n* **Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm** [I recommend buying from Target for ~$3 a stick]: It has a pretty standard, Chapstick-esque texture, but I find it’s more moisturizing. The lip balm’s also water-resistant for 80 minutes, which is pretty freaking awesome. Broad-spectrum protection is assured from avobenzone stabilized with octocrylene. There’s also the added benefit of the antioxidants vitamins E, C, and A (in the forms of tocopherol acetate, ascorbic acid, and retinyl palmitate). It’s entirely fragrance free, and it’s slightly sweetened for all you compulsive lip-lickers (though one probably shouldn’t bite chunks off the balm!) \n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Avobenzone (2%), Octocrylene (10%), Oxybenzone (6%), Other: Petrolatum, Polyethylene, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Trimethylsiloxyphenyl Dimethicone, Microcrystalline Wax, Isopropyl Myristate, Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-8, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbic Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Silica, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Saccharin, Propylparaben, Butylparaben\n\n* **NIVEA a Kiss of Smoothness Hydrating Lip Care SPF 15** [I recommend buying from Target for $2.99 a stick]: This is much more emollient than Banana Boat’s balm, and definitely feels very rich on the lips. UVA protection is assured from avobenzone stabilized with octocrylene. Antioxidant properties make only a small presence from a sprinkling of shea butter in the formula. The product is ever so lightly fragranced.\n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Avobenzone (2.5%), Octinoxate (6.0%), Octocrylene (1.8%) Inactive: Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Microcrystalline Wax, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetyl Palmitate, Myristyl Myristate, Polyglyceryl-3 Dilsostearate, Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Simmondsia Chinenesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, C20-40 Alkyl Stearate, Beeswax, Fragrance.\n\n* **Shiseido Sun Protection Lip Treatment SPF 35** [$22.00 from Shiseido.com; uncertain how expensive it is at the department store]: $22 is definitely a major splurge for a lip product, especially when other great lip balms are much cheaper, but if one wishes to splurge, this is a good option! This features a combination of octinoxate and titanium dioxide for broad-spectrum protection. It provides a moderate amount of hydration, and leaves a faint (and I do mean faint, but definitely noticeable upon closer inspection) white cast, which can be a good and a bad thing. For those who wish to lighten and brighten their lips a little, this is a quick way to do it while getting sun protection. IMO, it looks particularly good on Asians (which is probably why Shiseido, a Japanese brand, created this!) However, if applied on chapped lips, minerals can collect in flaky parts and create white splotches. I recommend using a lip scrub and applying a thin layer of an emollient lip balm underneath if this is a problem. This product is moderately fragranced with the same scent Shiseido uses in their other sunscreens. This used to be labeled as SPF 36 and PA++, but I'm quite certain the formula didn't change.\n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Octinoxate (7.4%), Titanium Dioxide (5%), Other: Trioctanoin, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Triisostearin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyethylene, PEG/PPG-36/41 Dimethyl Ether, Microcrystalline Wax, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Glutathione, Zinc Myristate, Thiotaurine, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Diisostearyl Malate, Sodium Magnesium Silicate, Glycerin, BHT, Fragrance\n\n\nAs a final note, I've used lip balms with SPF as a sunscreen stick for other parts of my body (like the back of my hands) in a pinch. It works pretty well, but it feels pretty gross cause it's been all over the mouth haha.\n\n**Good luck and godspeed with all sunscreen-related endeavors!**\n",

    "body": "So last week somebody asked about the legitimacy of the 3W Clinic items that are listed for SUPER cheap on RRS.  I answered that I have tried a few of them and am actually the person who left the 5-star review on the [Collagen Whitening Essence](http://www.roseroseshop.com/3w-clinic/3w-clinic-collagen-whitening-essence-50ml.html?page=2).  Since I had previously bought a ten-pack of samples of [TFS Blanclouding White Moisture Serum](http://www.roseroseshop.com/the-face-shop-blanclouding-white-moisture-serum-50ml.html) and completely forgotten about them, I thought it would be interesting to actually use the samples consistently *for once* so as to compare the performance.  \n\nAs I had already been using the 3W Clinic with great happiness for over a week, twice a day, I simply switched to the TFS, using half a sample pack in each of my twice daily routines.  As the TFS is thicker, I put it on later in my routine, but not by much as it absorbs pretty quickly.  It also SMELLS quite strongly, very floral, which is weird because I have a pretty dead sense of smell.  After a week of using the TFS twice a day like a good little guinea pig, I am OUT of this experiment, as my skin is less bright than it was a week ago and I am sporting two whiteheads that are really harshing my PocketDerm-induced mellow.  The whiteheads could be caused by something else, but looking at the [cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_cf3c203815.html), I see that it contains ethylhexyl palmitate which is a whopping 4 on the acne trigger scale.  Maybe this serum just doesn't play well with others, or maybe the whiteheads are a coincidence, but I don't really care because here's the thing: the cheap af 3W Clinic Essence WORKS BETTER.\n\nI know that a week isn't really long enough to get all sciency about comparing products, but I draw the line at whiteheads.  As you can see from the [cosdna for the 3W Clinic](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_a75a203828.html), the only real whitening ingredient these two products contain is niacinamide, and on the 3W Clinic ingredient list, niacinamide appears 6th (whatever that means) vs. 8th on the TFS.  And the highest acne trigger rating on the 3W Clinic is a 2 for triethanol amine, which didn't break me out.  Whatever that means in science terms, what it means in practical terms is that the 3W Clinic essence brightened my skin to really luminous levels within a few days, whereas the TFS didn't get me anywhere near that bright within a week.  Performance is certainly the most important criterion for comparison, but price is easily the second most important, so here goes: the 3W Clinic essence is currently selling at RRS for $2.81 for a 50ml bottle.  The TFS serum?  $16.07 for a 50ml bottle.  YMMV, but my cheap ass is sticking with 3W Clinic!\n\nTL;DR: 3W Clinic rules, Blanclouding drools.",

    "body": "**NOTE:** I'm talking about the one with the [green and yellow packaging](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/rohto-mentholatum-hada-labo-gokujyun-oil-cleansing-200ml/info.html/pid.1068397806), NOT the one with the white label on the front.\n\n**WHY I BOUGHT IT**\n\nThis is my first time trying an oil cleanser - I was reluctant to try one for a while because I don't wear makeup, so I thought it would just be a waste. However, I was really interested in the potential to unclog pores, which is what really attracted me to this. This oil cleanser is a cult favourite and it seems to be loved by so many people, as well as being fragrance-free and affordable.\n\n**MY SKIN TYPE/CONCERNS**\n\nI have pretty dry skin most of the time, which was dehydrated but since finding Curel Intensive Moisture Cream acts pretty normal most of the time, although I do have to be speedy about putting skincare on once I cleanse my face. I'm prone to clogged pores on my chin and nose as well as inflammatory acne on my chin, but this has all been massively improved by Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid. Fragrance and essential oils cause acne for me.\n\n**HOW/WHERE I BOUGHT IT**\n\nPurchased on [Stylevana](https://www.stylevana.com/en_GB/rohto-mentholatum-hada-labo-gokujyun-oil-cleansing-japan-version-200ml.html), you can see my full haul [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ipx6hn/haul_stylevana_haul/) for \\~£12 for 200ml.\n\n**HOW LONG I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR**\n\nI've been using this oil cleanser for 3 weeks exactly, once a day in the evening as a first cleanse.\n\n**INGREDIENTS LIST**\n\n*Ethylhexyl palmitate, triethylhexanoin, sorbes tetraisostearate-30, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate,* ***olive fruit oil, water, sodium acetyl hyaluronate, hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, jojoba seed oil***\\*, (palmitic acid / ethyl hexanoic acid), dextrin, butyl carbamate propionyl iodide, BHT\\*\n\nAs you can see, it's a pretty basic ingredients list. Fragrance, essential oil and alcohol free, which is great if you're sensitive to any of those. The main oil here is olive fruit oil - not really much to say, it's quite nice and basic. There's also jojoba seed oil and two types of hyaluronic acid for some extra hydration, although this is a cleanser so there most likely won't be many hydrating benefits.\n\n**SCENT**\n\nNone at all, as you would expect. Does not smell like focaccia or pasta, unlike some other olive-oil based cleansers (according to what people say).\n\n**TEXTURE + EMULSIFICATION**\n\nThis has a very light, fluid texture. The colour is a pale yellow, as you would expect. It spreads really easily over your face and I only need one pump, meaning that it will most likely last me ages. This cleanser emulsifies super super quickly, so whenever I wash my hands before cleansing I have to make sure they are fully dry, as any moisture on them starts to emulsify the cleanser. As it emulsifies so well, it rinses off super quickly.\n\n**EFFECTS + CLEANSING POWER**\n\nI don't wear makeup, nor do I have a Sunscreenr :( so I can't prove how well it removes thick sunscreen or heavy makeup. I have tried it with 3 layers of P20 Kids SPF50+ which it removed really well though. After cleansing my skin feels really soft, plump and hydrated, so I think it's pretty gentle. Due to the fluidity, you also don't have to tug or rub to remove it, which is great.\n\nI don't think it's massively improved my clogged pores but it's pretty hard to tell. I haven't broken out at all this month which is pretty amazing, so maybe it has done it's job. Equally, it could be that the BHA has finally fully cleared up my skin after 2-3 months.\n\n**PACKAGING**\n\nThe packaging isn't cute or fun, but it is really functional. The pump is great - it dispenses the perfect amount of cleanser and it's very easy to use in the shower. The bottle is plastic so it's very shower-friendly and they also sell refills so you can save money and re-use your pump bottle.\n\n**OVERALL THOUGHTS**\n\nI love how it makes my skin feel so soft after cleansing, and it really does cut through layers of sunscreen. Coupled with the easy application, great price and quick emulsification it's a winner in my eyes! It may not be the most exciting cleanser, nor does it have the most fun, cute packaging, but it does what it was supposed to really well - I couldn't ask for more at the price point.\n\n**9/10 - I recommend this product if you want an affordable, fragrance-free and very effective oil cleanser that emulsifies quickly. Definitely WRP, although I might branch out and try a cleansing balm. Does anyone have any fragrance-free suggestions?**",

    "body": "I came across a new sunscreen by Koh Gen Do in Tokyu Hands today [photos here](http://imgur.com/a/ZXRXI) It's called the Sun Protect Spa Gel UV SPF50+ PA++++. It contains titanium dioxide and zinc oxide (both physical sunscreen filters), and it claims it's waterproof, doesn't have a whitecast, and has a watery texture. It retails for 3,780yen with tax (about $35 USD, 25GBP, $45CAD, $48AUD, $48SGD) - to give you a comparison, Biore UV Watery Gel is about 700yen here. It's not cheap! You get 40g of product.\n\nI picked it up as it felt very light on my hand and left a nice 'hydrated' look without any obvious stickiness or heaviness, which seems great for summer.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more in depth review of it - I plan on trying it out this week.\n\nIngredients (apologies for any spelling mistakes, I translated this myself):\nWater, Zinc oxide, ethylhexyl palmitate, butylene glycol, titanium dioxide, dimethicone, hydrated silica, hydrogen dimethicone, hot spring water, lavender extract, rosemary extract, sage extract, mugwort extract, shiso extract, ginger root extract, Japanese angelica root extract, French maritime pine bark extract, ceramide NP, hydrolyzed conchiolin, glycyrrhizic acid dipotassium, aloe vera extract, sagarame (kelp) extract, HDI/ trimethylol hexyllactone crosspolymer, aluminium starch octenylsuccinate, talc, silica, alumina, isononanoic acid isotridecyl ester, pentylene glycol, polyhydroxystearic acid, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose stearoxy ether, aluminium hydroxide, t-butyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol\n\nEdited for spelling and formatting.",

Mineral oil is 100% for me because I used to cleanse with mineral oil and used it for 6+ months, not knowing why my skin had gone to hell and blaming everything on earth before the MO because it's considered so non-comedogenic. Not for me. I went from clear skin to cysts all over for half a year because of it! and that's just from cleansing with it.. less than a minute a day on my skin before being washed off with my second cleanser!!)\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate seems to be in so many of the \"original\" cushion foundations, especially the Amore Pacific brand ones. Makes me sad but the newer cushions often omit it so I'm more hopeful.\n\nCetearyl Alcohol seems to be in SO many cream products. It puts things like Sulwhasoo ginseng cream, Banila Co flower honey cream etc. out of my reach :( I'm not entirely sure it's the Cetearyl that broke me out (but the other potential triggers in Cerave Lotion are safe for me so it's likely) so I MAY give cetearyl alcohol another chance but Cerave wreaked havoc on my skin.\n\nHow about you? \n\nETA: I thought Cetearyl Alcohol but I realized it may be Polyglyceryl-3-Diisostearate rather than the Cetearyl because I think Cetyl and Stearyl Alcohols have been okay for me and Cetearyl is just a combination. If so I may be safe with some of the creams I am dying to try. Pinpointing problem ingredients is so difficult! ",

        "body": "What breaks me out is hard to keep track of, but twice in my life I've gotten allergic reactions from skincare - and both times it was cleansers from **Lush**. (Spoiler: the bad guy in my skincare life is anything with rose!)\n\nThe worst was from their \"scrub\" *Angels On Bare Skin*. I started to swell up all over my face and ears, got a sore rash around my eyes, nose and mouth, and to top it off I got small water filled blisters on my neck and chest. At that time I thought the reaction could have come from the ground almonds, since I've got pretty bad hay fever and having an allergy to nuts as well is very common (but I can eat almonds, so I wasn't sure...).\n\nThe other product I reacted to was their balm cleanser *Ultrabland*. It wasn't as bad. After a few days of using it and actually liking it, I developed, yet again, a rash around my eyes. It was itchy and dry and I started to flake a lot, especially on my eyelids and inner corners. I was flabbergasted, I had no idea what had happened! It was supposed to be such a mild cleanser, and it wasn't until I remembered the first incident with the scrub that I re-checked the ingredients and saw that both had rose water and/or rose absolute in them. \n\nSo now I'm terrified of anything with rose. I feel like those incidents scarred me for life! I never want to have to deal with a (allergic) reaction like that again.",

    "body": "Hi lovelies! While others here have posted the ingredients for products in the bag, we all still need to do research on their safety, comedogenicity etc. Luckily, I've done some of the work for you! The products are listed in alphabetical order for your convenience.\n\n--\n\n[Antipodes Skin Brightening Serum](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_1f93166999.html) - Everything here looks pretty safe, except some of the fragrances - in particular Cinnamal (which occurs naturally in cinnamon oil). As we know, cinnamon is indeed an irritant so if you have sensitivities, stay away.\n\n[Avene Thermal Spring Water](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_db2c34022.html) - Acne and irritant ratings up to 2. The long-term safety of some ingredients may be questionable for some users.\n\n[Bioderma Hydrabio Serum](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_0b85176465.html) - Contains Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA and Phenoxyethanol. Nothing particularly alarming here, unless you have sensitivities.\n\n[Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_3168113584.html) - Contains cetyl alcohol, with comedogenic and irritant ratings of 2. Also of note: this a physical exfoliant, which contains grainy bits.\n\n[Burt's Bees Tinted Lip Balm](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8286181477.html) - Acne rating for ingredients go up to a 4, while the irritant rating is up to 2. Although this is a lip balm, so you're probably safe.\n\nDr Lewinn's Multi Moisture Balm - No result for this on CosDNA, but the ingredients can be found [here](https://www.priceline.com.au/skincare/face-care/serum-and-treatments/multi-moisture-balm-50-g). I can see Ethylhexyl Palmitate, so if you're sensitive like me beware.\n\nEssano ROsehip Nourishing Hand Creme - No results, but the ingredients are listed [here](https://www.priceline.com.au/skincare/hand-and-body/hand-moisturisers/rosehip-nourishing-hand-creme-120-ml). Contains alcohols, but nothing else stands out to me.\n\n[Formula 10.0.6 Keep Me Clean Wipes](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_01ec112648.html) - Acne ratings up to 1, contains Alcohol Denat with an irritant rating of 5. The safety of preservatives and fragrances may be of concern to some users.\n\n[Garnier Miracle Skin Cream](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_819d172459.html) - Both acne and irritant ratings up to 5, and the long-term safety of some ingredients is questionable. Please use discretion if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin.\n\nInnoxa Organic Brightening Eye Creme - Once again no info on CosDNA. Ingredient list can be found [here](https://www.priceline.com.au/skincare/face-care/eye-treatments/organic-brightening-eye-creme-15-ml). Contains alcohols.\n\n[Jergens Original Beauty Lotion](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_ca44110756.html) - Sadly I'm seeing red flags everywhere here. Comedogenicity ratings up to 2, irritant ratings up to 5. The safety of quite a few ingredients is questionable, so please use with discretion, particularly if you have sensitive skin.\n\nKey Sun Zinke Stick - Ingredients can be found [here](http://www.keysun.com.au/store/key-sun-zinke-stick-spf-30-5g). Please check the ingredients list if you have known sensitivities to sunscreen ingredients!\n\nLanolips Lip Ointment with Colour - No results, ingredients may  be found [Here](https://www.priceline.com.au/skincare/lip-care/balms/lanolips-lip-ointment-with-colour-rose-spf15-12.5-g). Considering it's a lip product you're probably fine, barring sensitivities/allergies.\n\n[La Roche Posay Barrier Repairing Balm](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d6d5185479.html) - Acne ratings up to 4, irritant ratings up to 2. Contains Ethylhexyl Palmitate.\n\nLe Tan Foaming Mousse - No results. Ingredients can be found [here](https://www.priceline.com.au/skincare/sun-and-tanning/instant-tan/fast-tan-dark-bronze-instant-foaming-mousse-110-ml). Contains Disodium EDTA, Dimethicone and Benzyl Alcohol.\n\n[L'Oreal Revitalift Magic Blur](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e336136013.html) - Acne ratings up to 1, contains Aluminium Hydroxide so watch out if you have sensitivities. \n\n[Montagne Jeunesse Blemish Mud](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_c22b103497.html) - Nothing really of alarm here, yay!\n\n[Nivea Lip Butter](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f5f104733.html) - Acne ratings up to 1, contains Butylated Hydroxytoluene.\n\n[Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_eb59156161.html) - Comedogenicity up to 3, irritant ratings up to 2. Contains salicylic acid.\n\n[Palmers Shea Butter Formula](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_011181779.html) - Acne ratings up to 5, irritant ratings up to 3. The safety of some ingredients may be of concern depending on user. Contains alcohols.\n\nPure Paw Paw Ointment - The ingredients are: Petrolatum, Carica Papaya (fermented) Fruit Extract, Cera Alba, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate. Please note this isn't on the Therapeutic Goods List like the Lucas' brand.\n\nRosken Intensive Moisture Hand Cream - Ingredients can be found [here](https://www.priceline.com.au/index.php/skincare/hand-and-body/hand-moisturisers/intensive-moisture-hand-cream-75-ml). Contains BHT, Disodium EDTA, Cinnamal and Dimethicone.\n\nSukin Detoxifying Clay Masque - Ingredients are listed [here](https://www.priceline.com.au/index.php/skincare/face-care/masks-and-peels/super-greens-detoxifying-clay-masque-100-ml). Contains alcohols, as well as avocado oil which can be comedogenic for some.\n\nSwisspers Rosehip Rejuvenating Wipes - Ingredients can be found [here](https://www.priceline.com.au/index.php/skincare/face-care/facial-wipes/rosehip-rejuvenating-facial-cleansing-wipes-25-wipes). Contains alcohols and Disodium EDTA.\n\n[Thursday Plantation Tea Tree and Witch Hazel Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_4973145740.html) - This one actually looks pretty safe, with nothing registering on the acne or irritant lists. Please still be careful if you have sensitivities/allergies.\n\n--\n\nFor more information on some of the ingredients mentioned, here are some scholarly articles (yeah, we're doing it /r/skincareaddiction style up in here!)\n\n[Disodium EDTA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396676)\n\n[Butylated Hydroxytoluene - BHT](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396675)\n\n[Dimethicone](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14555417)\n\n--\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nAll links to cosDNA are the most recent entry for each item, where possible, to account for formula changes. Whether these ingredient lists truly reflect what's in the products, I cannot say.\n\nI know that some people will have received completely different products in the bag, so this may not completely apply to all of you. Still, I think this is a great start if you're wondering about the safety of your products.\n\nHowever, this *is* just a starting point. I encourage you all to not just read my little TL;DR's but to visit the results linked and scan for any known allergies or sensitivities. Please, don't just take my word that things will be safe because skincare is such a personal thing, and some items that work well with my skin may be nightmare fuel for yours.\n\nConsidering just how many products were missing from the cosDNA database, I've decided that I'll be working toward adding them. Of course, I shall be updating this post with links. If I myself have missed a product in this post, feel free to point it out - taking note that the coupon products were left out on purpose.\n\n--\n\n*Thank you to everybody for taking the time to read all this. Happy and safe skin-caring!*",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI recently vacationed in Japan and picked up some stuff. Lots of Korean products since I checked out Shin-Okubo and the sales lady was... very persuading, haha.\n\nI did pick some stuff which I haven't seen here (correct me if I'm wrong) and I will slowly post reviews once I use them.\n\nMy haul:\nhttp://imgur.com/vUwSmtq\n\nI forgot to photograph other stuff I'd already bought and used like DHC lipbalm, Kiss me Heroine mascara, Kate eyeshadow, Canake eyeshadow primer, super cute headband from Tokyu Hands (purple and mint)...\n\nFirst of all, a cleansing balm. I normally use **Shu Uemura ultime8 sublime beauty cleansing oil** (+ either Hada Labo cleanser or a cheapo German one as 2nd cleanser) and I looove it. It even gets rid of the Kiss me Heroine mascara!\n\nI was browsing in a Ainz&Tulpe shop in Harajuku and saw this and thought it sounded interesting:\nhttp://imgur.com/vkwSH00\nhttp://imgur.com/gbuebKz\nhttp://imgur.com/kyXv536\n\n* Cationic surfacant free (I'd to google this)\n* Fragrance free\n* Colorant free\n* Paraben free\n* Alcohol free\n* Mineral oil free\n\nAnd it was pretty cheap 1620 yen for 100 g. It comes with a little plastic spoon (hidden under the lid).\n\nThis is how it looks undisturbed:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/l8bdfJ2\n\nOn the spoon:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/X62ZlJT\n\nOn skin (slightly massaged in):\n\nhttp://imgur.com/o7159Vs\n\nI put on the following:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/1KTo3LU\n\n* Liquid foundation (Chifure)\n* One-day tattoo super black eyeliner (only thing my oily eyelids will not destroy)\n* Guerlain red lipstick\n* Shu Uemura purple eyeshadow\n\nYou have to use it on dry skin, take a small amount of the balm  and massage it onto the skin. Then rinse with warm water.\n\nBefore rinsing:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/mv3ah\n\n(You can see it took off my foundation, lipstick and eyeshadow but the eyeliner remains)\n\nAfter rinsing:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Azg4jIJ\n\n(Yay, eyeliner is gone!)\n\nMy skin hasn't freaked out yet (it felt soooft). Their lotion apparently is pretty popular but since it is a new product I haven't found any reviews on it.\n\nhttp://alovivi.jp/shopdetail/000000000068/ct24/page1/order/\n\nMy skin: Dehydrated but oily (nose and forehead). 28 years old, live in Germany.\n\n**Ingredients (Google translated):**\nEthylhexyl palmitate, triethylhexanoin, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, isopropyl palmitate, PEG-5 glyceryl triisostearate, aloe vera leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, squalane, comedocasphospholipid, hydrogenated lecithin, lysolecithin, Lime fruit juice, orange juice, lemon juice, grapefruit fruit extract, hawthorn extract, jujube fruit extract, apple fruit extract, water soluble proteoglycan, water soluble collagen, yuzu fruit extract, pearl barley seed extract, Argania spinosa nuclear oil, olive fruit oil, Jojoba seed oil, tocopherol, water, BG, phenoxyethanol\n\nAnd: Isn't this Sailor Moon blush beautiful??\nhttp://imgur.com/ZnXvDYw",

    "body": "**Supergoop! Zinc Screen 100% Mineral Lotion**\n\nPart two of my journey into all things Supergoop! and we are here with their Zinc Screen 100% Mineral Lotion.\n\nThis sunscreen contains Zinc Oxide as its uv filter along with Titanium Dioxide and Iron Oxides for tint/additional protection. Other ingredients include Coconut Fruit Extract and Blueberry Fruit Extract (although the amounts seem to be really minimal). \n\nI have been on the HUNT for a mineral sunscreen that truly leaves minimal/no white cast or ashy-ness behind. It seems like every brand throws words like “sheer” or “invisible” pretty freely when trying to market their Zinc/Titanium Oxide sunscreens…but non of them have really delivered for me. Even some that have a mix of mineral and chemical filters still give off an odd cast or collect around my neck and eyelids. \n\nWhile I had some high hopes for this product based on reviews I have seen…the Supergoop! Zinc Screen sadly performed just like so many others (on my skin). It only took a few days of consistent use before I was ready to throw in the towel.\n\nThe creamy and relatively lightweight of this sunscreen feels really nice going on…but it never really seems to dry down or “set” onto my skin. Using a TINY amount…I was able to blend things out pretty well. But, using the proper amount of sunscreen needed for protection left my skin with streaky/off colored sections that didn’t really ever blend. My face felt/looked like an ever changing sand sculpture of various browns/tans LOL! Not a good look.\n\nUsing a pouf or Beauty Blender did help to even things out…but as soon as I got it evened out the Supergoop! Zinc Screen tended to gather and crease around my eyes and neck. Once again not the greatest look/result.\n\nI loved that there is no essential oils in the formula and it did seem to have some hydrating benefit…but outside or that the Supergoop! Zinc Screen was pretty much unwearable for me (at least anywhere outside of the house LOL).\n\nIn the end…I swatched this product on my roommate (who has much fairer skin than me) and it looked MUCH better. She also has normal/dry skin and the product seems to just “play” better with her face. So, I think there is a market for this product and some people may end up loving it. It just wasn’t for me and not something I would come back to.\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nActive Ingredients:\n\nZinc Oxide 13%\n\nInactive Ingredients:\n\nWater, Tetradecane, Cetearyl Nonanoate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isopropyl Palmitate, Isopropyl Myristate, Glycerin, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Mica, Propanediol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Gluconolactone, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Brassica Campestris/ Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Fructose, Octyldodecyl Oleate, Tocopherol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Iron Oxides (CI 77492), Dodecane, Hexadecane, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Withania Somnifera Flower Extract, Iron Oxides (CI 77491), Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Silica, Calcium Gluconate \n\nWhere To Buy (Supergoop!

I also noticed the Honeysuckle extract is now at the bottom, and Ceramide NP is a bit lower on the list. The Ethylhexyl palmitate scares me a bit since it may be comedogenic (but I don't take these lists seriously anymore, canola oil is a 5 on the scale and doesn't break me out, whereas jojoba oil is 0-2 but it breaks me out). \n\nSo yeah I was just asking if anyone has used both versions and if the new one is as good as the old one. I jusy tried it on my hands so far I love the texture :D Plus side is that it's probably even better for sensitive skin without the Myrtus extract.",

I started using this at the beginning of summer, and yes, it's very hydrating, lightweight, non greasy, and is perfect for those weathers where it ain't humid.\n\nPost application, the skin didn't feel greasy or heavy at all, but due to humid, skin felt..... Wet. Like I've washed my face with really cool and hydrating water, but it feels damp for a while.\n\nAs per description, it has ingredients that are not just meant to hydrate your skin, but also maintain the pH balance in a way that your skin stays moisturized for a longer period. I can't confirm this as I used the cream in heavy summer (plus I've combination skin). If there's any dry skin user who can confirm this, I'll update your comment here.\n\nIt's definitely better than Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel if we consider its long term benefits, with time I could feel my skin getting healthier and better. So I'll probably purchase it during another heavy discount sale, but it ain't a preference due to the price \n\n**Will I Recommend?** Definitely Yes\n\n**WRP:** No🧟‍♀️\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "**NOTE:** I'm talking about the one with the [green and yellow packaging](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/rohto-mentholatum-hada-labo-gokujyun-oil-cleansing-200ml/info.html/pid.1068397806), NOT the one with the white label on the front.\n\n**WHY I BOUGHT IT**\n\nThis is my first time trying an oil cleanser - I was reluctant to try one for a while because I don't wear makeup, so I thought it would just be a waste. However, I was really interested in the potential to unclog pores, which is what really attracted me to this. This oil cleanser is a cult favourite and it seems to be loved by so many people, as well as being fragrance-free and affordable.\n\n**MY SKIN TYPE/CONCERNS**\n\nI have pretty dry skin most of the time, which was dehydrated but since finding Curel Intensive Moisture Cream acts pretty normal most of the time, although I do have to be speedy about putting skincare on once I cleanse my face. I'm prone to clogged pores on my chin and nose as well as inflammatory acne on my chin, but this has all been massively improved by Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid. Fragrance and essential oils cause acne for me.\n\n**HOW/WHERE I BOUGHT IT**\n\nPurchased on [Stylevana](https://www.stylevana.com/en_GB/rohto-mentholatum-hada-labo-gokujyun-oil-cleansing-japan-version-200ml.html), you can see my full haul [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ipx6hn/haul_stylevana_haul/) for \\~£12 for 200ml.\n\n**HOW LONG I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR**\n\nI've been using this oil cleanser for 3 weeks exactly, once a day in the evening as a first cleanse.\n\n**INGREDIENTS LIST**\n\n*Ethylhexyl palmitate, triethylhexanoin, sorbes tetraisostearate-30, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate,* ***olive fruit oil, water, sodium acetyl hyaluronate, hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, jojoba seed oil***\\*, (palmitic acid / ethyl hexanoic acid), dextrin, butyl carbamate propionyl iodide, BHT\\*\n\nAs you can see, it's a pretty basic ingredients list. Fragrance, essential oil and alcohol free, which is great if you're sensitive to any of those. The main oil here is olive fruit oil - not really much to say, it's quite nice and basic. There's also jojoba seed oil and two types of hyaluronic acid for some extra hydration, although this is a cleanser so there most likely won't be many hydrating benefits.\n\n**SCENT**\n\nNone at all, as you would expect. Does not smell like focaccia or pasta, unlike some other olive-oil based cleansers (according to what people say).\n\n**TEXTURE + EMULSIFICATION**\n\nThis has a very light, fluid texture. The colour is a pale yellow, as you would expect. It spreads really easily over your face and I only need one pump, meaning that it will most likely last me ages. This cleanser emulsifies super super quickly, so whenever I wash my hands before cleansing I have to make sure they are fully dry, as any moisture on them starts to emulsify the cleanser. As it emulsifies so well, it rinses off super quickly.\n\n**EFFECTS + CLEANSING POWER**\n\nI don't wear makeup, nor do I have a Sunscreenr :( so I can't prove how well it removes thick sunscreen or heavy makeup. I have tried it with 3 layers of P20 Kids SPF50+ which it removed really well though. After cleansing my skin feels really soft, plump and hydrated, so I think it's pretty gentle. Due to the fluidity, you also don't have to tug or rub to remove it, which is great.\n\nI don't think it's massively improved my clogged pores but it's pretty hard to tell. I haven't broken out at all this month which is pretty amazing, so maybe it has done it's job. Equally, it could be that the BHA has finally fully cleared up my skin after 2-3 months.\n\n**PACKAGING**\n\nThe packaging isn't cute or fun, but it is really functional. The pump is great - it dispenses the perfect amount of cleanser and it's very easy to use in the shower. The bottle is plastic so it's very shower-friendly and they also sell refills so you can save money and re-use your pump bottle.\n\n**OVERALL THOUGHTS**\n\nI love how it makes my skin feel so soft after cleansing, and it really does cut through layers of sunscreen. Coupled with the easy application, great price and quick emulsification it's a winner in my eyes! It may not be the most exciting cleanser, nor does it have the most fun, cute packaging, but it does what it was supposed to really well - I couldn't ask for more at the price point.\n\n**9/10 - I recommend this product if you want an affordable, fragrance-free and very effective oil cleanser that emulsifies quickly. Definitely WRP, although I might branch out and try a cleansing balm. Does anyone have any fragrance-free suggestions?**",

    "body": "Read Part 0, for an introduction to me and why I'm doing this, [here.](http://redd.it/25q7hv)\n\nBefore I get into my review for the Alba Botanica Mineral SPF 30, I should amend my last review for Coppertone's Water Babies Pure & Simple, SPF 50, reviewed [here.](http://redd.it/27ejhg) On further reflection, I don't think I got quite as badly burned on my neck as I had thought. Instead, I think the sunscreen just dried my skin out horribly. When I apply sunscreen, I usually wipe any excess off my hands by lifting my shirt a bit and rubbing them on my love handles. Well, those love handles are incredibly dry and even cracked a bit, and I think the Coppertone is the culprit. So, while the Coppertone probably gets a pass on the protection, it doesn't play nice with my skin, and the search continues.\n\nI went on another short camping trip, and this time I picked up the Alba Botanica Sport Mineral SPF 45 that I reviewed in [Part 1.](http://redd.it/25z27d) As a camping sunscreen, it worked great, ignoring the several layers of white cast. At the same time, I also picked up (almost on a whim) a tube of Alba Botanica's Mineral SPF 30 (the non-sport version). When I got home from camping, I decided to give it a shot.\n\nI got it on sale at Sprouts for a little over $8 for 4oz. I've seen it go for about the same price at Target as well, so it's both easily available and affordable. It's 14.5% ZnO and 2% TO2, which I hope to be adequate UVB and UVA protection. It also includes a fair number of plant-derived inactive ingredients, which I assume means that there are some decent antioxidants in it. I'm by no means an expert on this, so I'm hoping those who are will chime in.\nHere's the list of other ingredients: Aqua (water), aloe barbadensis leaf juice¹, caprylic/capric triglyceride, dimethicone, ethylhexyl palmitate, sorbitan sesquioleate, glycerin, butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil¹, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil¹, polyglyceryl-3 ricinoleate, vitis vinifera (grape) seed oil, calendula officinalis flower extract¹, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract¹, magnesium sulfate, silica, sodium chloride, tocopheryl acetate, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, polyhydroxystearic acid. \n\nAs a daily sunscreen, this one is pretty good. It didn't sting my eyes at all, and left only the slightest shade of white on my face. If anything, it made my face shiny, but not white. Unfortunately, after about 1/2 hour, that shininess turned into a kind of gross moist feeling on my face. At that point, if I rubbed it in again, it got much better and the moisture and shininess went away. However, at that point I wasn't sure if I had rubbed it in well or rubbed it *off*. I'm still getting used to physical sunscreens and it's so hard to tell if/when I need to reapply.\n\nThe other reason this isn't quite my grail is that it made my skin feel very heavy, if that's the right word. I could always tell I had a thick layer of the stuff on, even if it didn't show up as a white cast. Reapplying, of course, made this even worse. All in all, though, I think this one is the closest I have come to finding one I can use daily.\n\nUp next: Coppertone Oil-Free Faces, SPF 50. This one is a chemical sunscreen I picked up at Walgreen's, I had never seen it in SPF 50 before and the list of actives is impressive, at least on paper. Stay tuned!\n",

But I have to admit, I have NEVER enjoyed using cleansing oils in my life. To me they are almost a necessary evil - so effective, but I just HATE how runny and drippy they are. Sure, I have learned through practice & experience how not to drip everywhere, but nonetheless it's not an experience I enjoy. If Johnson & Johnson can make a cheap baby oil gel, can't we get some gel oil cleansers up in here???      \n\nI also don't like balms and sherbets b/c I can't deal with the spatulas and the jars. I like to pump and apply to my face, quickly. And the ethical concerns w/ polyethylene and all make me a little reluctant as well       \n\nWhat I do like: lotion and cream cleansers. They don't run. I enjoy massaging them around my face. They come in handy pumps or tubes, instead of jars. But...they are often much worse at cleansing compared to balms and oils. I have a couple I like as AM or 2nd cleansers, but I've yet to find any good enough to be 1st cleansers. AND...often they contain high-risk/comedogenic ingredients (MANY oils + milks have ethylhexyl palmitate and isopropyl myristate high on the ingreds lists)    \n\nDo there exist any (affordably priced) unicorns out there???    \n- gel or cream texture so as not to run, as liquid-y oils do       \n- packaged in a tube or pump, not in a jar    \n- enough oil/cleansing power to melt off stubborn ss & face makeup        \n- rinses relatively clean w/ water             \n- ingreds that aren't terrifying to an acne-prone        \n\nIn all likelihood I bet this unicorn doesn't exist, but I figured if anyone knew, it would be here on AB! fingers crossed    \n\n(And yep I saw snow's review on the cremorlab cleansing gel but it's $$ and not easily accessible. I saw the acid queen's review on some cleansing oil gel but she listed it as a 2nd cleanser. I know Boscia makes one but that's also too $$ for me to use daily. Not looking for a pool cleanser type of product either)",

Summer gone and locked up in a pumpkin carved coffin, but somehow manages to creep up on us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of weeks ago I bought this product since it reminded me of those tictok vids. where girls do their makeup and spray a bottle to turn their neck white.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't used this on my face, yet since I did a tested on my neck first. It honestly felt nice\\~ imagine applying cool freshly made whip cream gliding onto your skin as it accompanies with a lightly sweet scent. But after massaging/patting it down, it felt really greasy and added a heavy shine. It can be fixed with a powder finish, but I'm lazy and just rather opt it out of my face routine. Also notice it says SPF instead of SPF -insertnumberhere- ? Not taking any risks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started using it on my arms more since they get more exposure then the rest of my body, and so far I'd like to call it Purgatory- it's not good, but it's not bad either. The shine faded away within roughly 10 minutes  and the \"whitening effect\" last maybe half an hour at most., but the one thing that did make me go, \"Hmmm?' was the hydration. On the photo below, near my wrist I have these little dry patches, these little flakes went away and haven't returned throughout the day so it could be a reason why the box just focuses on moisture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Didn't want to show my sausage fingers](https://preview.redd.it/groja4nfssr11.jpg?width=7296&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f36dc5af5ac487dc9d2239188c87a089ac4373c)\n\nSorry for the lighting, but I tried to take this in natural lighting within a span of a few seconds before each picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients List:\n\nWater, Cyclopentasiloxane, Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Sodium Chloride, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Triethoxycaprylylsilane\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjy81f1sssr11.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efecdd57b2b61b248c15713c76c629ff08cdb01a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow excuse me while I do something about my hair arms, didn't realized it was so prominent!",

How cheap is that?!\nhttp://www.misshaus.com/super-aqua-ultra-water-full-control-emulsion.html\n\nThe emulsion has this ingredient list:\nWater, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Niacinamide, Shea Water, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Mineral Water, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Sea Water, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Myrothamnus Flabellifolia Callus Culture Extract, Rhizophora Mangle Callus Culture Extract, Salicornia Herbacea Callus Culture Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Callus Culture Extract, Lactobacillus Extract, Imperata Cylindrica Root Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Adenium Obesum Leaf Extract, Dimethicone, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Sorbitan Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, PEG-32, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexandiol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance\n\nGiven the Niacinamide is number 4 - I think this should be a pretty substantial percentage of active - but so far have been unable to find too much about it or info on percentages.  It looks like it released in Asia last year so I was hoping someone here had tried it and could comment? \n\nOr if any of you have tried the Instanatural serum any feedback?\n\nOr lastly - any raves on a high Niacinamide AB product in general?\n\nMy budget is super tight right now so I have to choose carefully.

Cloudy and milky when mixed well from shaking.\n\nTexture: watery oily essence, requires cotton pad for wiping off sunscreen/makeup\n\nCleansing power: did not live up to claims, refer to photos for tests on foundation, eye makeup and lip colours in comments\n\nMoisturizing: yes, skin does feel moisturized after even without additional skincare (but im oily in tropical climate so cannot attest for dry skin and climate)\n\nPore care: does not clean as well as advertised and very minimal tightening observed\n\nConclusion: WNRP, it’s a fun treat for those who wants to try something new but there are definitely better alternatives to cleansing water at the same or even lower price points.",

I was on adapalene for a year and stopped after I developed issues I never had before. Looking back, the blotchiness Im still dealing with is probably old sun damage coming to the surface since I only started wearing SPF religiously about 2 years ago. Im 25. \n\nI am planning on restarting adapalene eventually, but for now I want to start reintroducing some other actives. The only active I use currently is an Enzyme peeling every 3 days.

I eventually moved from OTC azelaic acid to Rx 20% and love it.\n\nVitamin C might also be helpful for you, G&G has a great one.\n\nI'm sure you already know this, and I'll get made fun of for bringing it up, but a retinoid could also really help you with everything you mentioned! If adapalene wasn't a good fit and/or too strong for your skin, just take that as feedback, take a step back, go with something less intense / lower concentration (like a gentle, low concentration retinol), and go low and slow. Retinoids are the gold standard for acne, an immediate term priority, and also for the other concerns you mentioned and anti-aging. Retinoid use is a loooooong game -- there's no rush, and no point in making yourself suffer just to use something strong or nightly. If you get a weak/gentle non-Rx retinol and are able to use just a dot of it even just once a week, that's still a win. You can do it more frequently each week, move up in concentration, or move up to stronger retinoids (retinaldehyde, tretinoin, tazarotene, etc) on your own time -- which could be years! There's seriously zero rush with retinoids, especially when you're using it for acne help and starting young. If you get irritation, pull back (skip nights, buffer between moisturizer, mix with moisturizer, etc) until you're back to normal. G&G has some nice retinoids (I believe retinol and retinal in various strengths).",

    "body": "Almost out of my beloved F&B that I’ve used for over a year but I don’t live near a MAC store. I was at Ulta and was tempted to buy the Studio Waterweight since it has a much thinner texture and didn’t seem like I had to use my fingers with it, but I’ve seen more mixed reviews and concerns about the Ethylhexyl Palmitate in it. I couldn’t get a sample of it at Ulta, but I’m thinking of going down to the MAC store this weekend to maybe sample it.\n\nI’m wondering how the Waterweight compares to the Face and Body in terms of coverage, longevity, and finish. For reference, I have more normal to dry skin, but have quite a bit of texture due to acne scars. I still love that sheer but buildable coverage MAC Face & Body has.\n\nI kind of want to try something new since I’ve been using F&B since high school (so for about 3 years now) and don’t like using my fingers, but I still want that undetectable, “no-foundation foundation” look that F&B gives.",

    "body": "Question/Concern: I need to find a new liquid or cream foundation for everyday use. I follow the Lisa Eldridge way of thought for covering my acne and PIH, so this needs to be a light to medium coverage that will be used on healthier skin areas. Already have a great concealer for the problem areas!\n\nSkin tone/Undertone: NC35, but I'll be at NC40 come this summer. Yellow undertones! Too many times, I've been duped into buying something with pink undertones. At Sephora, they've said I'm 3Y09, but I've been matched to 2Y09 foundations, too.\n\nSkin type: Oily combo skin. Also sensitive and acne prone, but I've been keeping it under control with a great skincare routine!\n\nAllergies (if applicable): tocepherol, Retinyl Palmitate, Palmitic Acid, Sorbitan Sesquinoleate, squalane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, and possibly beeswax.\n\nBudget (if applicable): ~$40. I'll consider drugstore, but a lot of their products contain ingredients that trigger my breakouts.\n\nPrevious Products (if applicable): \n\nPlease note, that I've read previous threads, and noticed that Meow Cosmetics was highly recommended, so I have some products from them coming in tomorrow! I suspect they'll be the best thing for my skin, but this girl is dreaming of a new liquid foundation ;)\n\n**Products that worked out and are in rotation:**\n\n- Kat Von D Lockit Tattoo Foundation in Medium 54 - Love it, but I have to get it in a lighter color because it oxidizes on me. This is a recurring theme, unfortunately. Coverage is too heavy for everyday. If I cannot find anything, then my last resort is to water its coverage down using moisturizer.\n\n- Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream in 27 - Loved the color match! However, I'm suspecting that I may be allergic to the beeswax in it. So, it's only used once and awhile.\n\n**Worked out great for coverage, but oxidization or color match issues:**\n\n- Neutrogena SkinClearing Makeup (various colors) worked out great, but could not find a color match. It either oxidized to an orange, or it came off as too pink.\n\n- Covergirl Stay Fabulous 3 in 1 Makeup (various colors) - I swear, covergirl foundations always oxidize on me. Findation said I had a good match with this foundation, but it always swatched as too pink or orange. I'm a fool for trying covergirl again.\n\n- Shiseido BB Cream in Dark - Oxidized, and when it wasn't orange, it looked pink.\n\n- Clinique Even Better Makeup in Cashew - turned orange. Like most Clinique foundations on my skin. \n\n- Clinique Stay Matte in Golden Neutral - Got a lighter color after trying EBM, hoping it would oxidize to the right color. Nope! Too pink. \n\n**Great color matches, loved coverage, but ended up being allergic to ingredients:**\n\n- L'Oreal True Match Liquid Foundation in W6\n- Shiseido Hydro Liquid Compact in O60 \n- Revlon Colorstay for Oily/Combo Skin (forgot shade, was so long ago)\n- Etude House Bright Fit, W24\n\n**Great color match, but lasting power was awful**\n\n- Laura Mercier Oil Free Foundation in Honey Beige\n\nMakeup Experience: 7.5\n\nPicture: [Rare picture of me without foundation](http://imgur.com/lJ7pQt1), sorry it is not close up! [Picture of me with foundation](http://imgur.com/Ujxyz1q).\n\n\n**If you find that a foundation worked well with a specific primer, please let me know! I'm planning to get a new primer, so this will help immensely.**",

AOA is a Korean-owned brand, and their focus is bringing their consumer base affordable beauty products.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gipedgj2ivve1.gif\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35wjzc3lfvve1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd120372aa6b02651de4ef05504af66ee59fde64\n\n***MISS A website*** \\- [https://www.shopmissa.com/products/aoa-lip-glaze-butter-lip-tint?variant=42023172243530](https://www.shopmissa.com/products/aoa-lip-glaze-butter-lip-tint?variant=42023172243530)\n\n***Refinery29 article on MISS A product safety*** \\- [https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/193078/miss-a-beauty-products-1-dollar-quality](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/193078/miss-a-beauty-products-1-dollar-quality)\n\n***TikTok showing try-on*** \\-  \n[https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjYARYas/](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjYARYas/)\n\n**Cost:** $1.88 each, or $3.00 each on TikTok Shop (vs rhode $18 each)\n\n**Packaging:** AOA hit the nail on the head with the packaging. It's cute and captures the minimalist 90s-00s vibe. The plastic for the AOA container feels like it could be a bit thinner than the rhode container, but both have an equally sturdy cap. I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference in the caps except that rhode has the slant on the top. The AOA applicator tip is perhaps a little lower quality visually than rhode applicator tip, but I can't tell a difference when using it. No plastic snags in the tip and it works well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tczo2fyqfvve1.jpg?width=3093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=877a77a0369f7a1734cfebde7673a9ce29520fe2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jyd9e2wthvve1.jpg?width=3044&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf01d0c26ad1bc9f5c59f235ef2066a41a18df97\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrx764wthvve1.jpg?width=3564&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48b6928a3102e5a877ca74a79b0c6068c688c2a1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jy88w6wthvve1.jpg?width=3155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35baa7f6efec4c8013ed8d6e3f85ddb86c80dfb7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clk0u6wthvve1.jpg?width=2841&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9163eeeff48375ea58ad6a74230de9ca6d386a95\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/199ml4wthvve1.jpg?width=2349&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c69e63313d41e923aa6e31c1d3cc8e65123cb932\n\n**Formula:**  The AOA lip glaze is smooth & feels cushiony on the lips. No graininess. For me, one application lasted on the lips for about 1-2 hours, and it does feel moisturizing. It's barely tacky. The formula is not particularly plumping but it works well as a basic, blurring, comfy, lacquer-finish gloss. I am honestly quite impressed by the performance despite the insanely low price tag. The rhode lip tints don’t agree with my lips at times, so I'd be happy with the AOA lip glaze as a cheaper alternative from time to time. Referencing the ingredients list below, the AOA lip glaze does not contain any peptides or seed oils, so if you have nut allergies, these could still work for you.\n\n**Shade:** see photos. 5 tinted shades + 1 clear. The AOA clear vanilla is truly translucent vs the rhode which has a very subtle opaqueness. The tinted AOA lip glazes have homogeneously distributed pigment and they don't separate.\n\nI don't have rhode \"ribbon\" or \"raspberry jelly,\" but I think AOA's \"strawberry\" and \"passionfruit\" are the closest shade matches to these, respectively. \"Candy\" and \"peach\" do not seem have rhode counterparts. I would probably repurchase the shade \"candy\" again, because it's just so unique & pretty. It suits me better than rhode's \"toast.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aui4vponfvve1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2de92c273093e5614f4ba09dd6bafe4062da4182\n\n**Scents:** Here's a major downside. The scents for all three of the AOA lip glazes that I picked up (clear vanilla, candy, and strawberry) all smell a bit artificial, and tbh, not that tasty. However, the scent is super light, and once applied to the lips, it's undetectable. I'm very sensitive to scents. When I apply the rhode scented tints (salted caramel, sugar cookie, and cinnamon roll), the scent definitely still lingers such that I can smell it while it's on. I know that rhode sugar cookie & cinnamon roll are very heavily perfumed, like excessively so, but at least I can say with certainty that the AOA ones are very lightly (albeit not amazingly) scented. There is absolutely NO taste to the AOA lip glaze. If these had no scent at all they would probably be a better product overall.\n\n**Ingredients list:** Obviously there are no peptides, but for $1.88 each, can't really expect them to include pricier ingredients.\n\nPolybutene, Isononyl Isononanoate, Diisostearyl Malate, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Fragrance (Parfum), Polyisobutene, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[+/- May Contain: Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), D&C Red No. 7 Calcium Lake (CI 15850), Iron Oxides (CI 77499), FD&C Yellow No. 5 Aluminum Lake (CI 19140), Iron Oxides (CI 77492), Iron Oxides (CI 77491), D&C Red No. 6 Barium Lake (CI 15850)\\].\n\n**Compared to rhode lip tint ingredients list:**\n\nHydrogenated Polyisobutene, Diisostearyl Malate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax (Cera Microcristallina) (Cire Microcristalline), Synthetic Wax, Octyldodecanol, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Tocopherol,Tocopheryl Acetate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1,Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Lactic Acid, Tribehenin, Stevioside, Phytosteryl/​Isostearyl/​Cetyl/​Stearyl/​Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Red 28 Lake (Ci 45410), Red 7 (Ci 15850), Yellow 5 Lake (Ci 19140),Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090)\n\n\\---\n\n***Master list of Rhode alternatives*** \\- [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/s/njiOpJSml5](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/s/njiOpJSml5)",

It’s not a peptide lip tint, just a lip tint.\n\nIMO the AOA lip glaze would make an amazing party favor or just as a basic lip balm to throw in your bag - one that you don’t have to be precious about.",

The Timeless 20% Vitamin C is a good one.\n\nI'd also recommend switching to a stronger sunscreen.  3% zinc oxide and 3% titanium dioxide is quite low, even if it is SPF 30.  You want strong UVA protection.  That's going to be your #1 defense against wrinkles.\n\nNiacinamide could be an easy thing to add to your routine.  It's in CeraVe PM (if you want to switch from the Trader Joe's one) or The Ordinary sells a 10% niacinamide serum.\n\nYou could also switch the retinol to tretinoin (the prescription strength version).  My sebaceous filaments went away with tretinoin, plus it's the gold standard for anti-aging.   You can get plain tretinoin from a doctor, or a compounded tretinoin cream with 4% niacinamide from Yoderm or Curology.\n\nSounds like you're off to a good start though!",

I have started following a skincare routine 11 days ago. It was a joyous Thursday for my face that, over the course of past 30 years, has been exposed to the winds, low temperatures, a late onslaught of chicken pox, persistent hormonal acne, and results of a poor diet. I also happen to have PCOS, which makes the challenge to have clear skin extra challenging.\n\nThis is our starting point. After reading through [the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index) on r/SkincareAddiction, I had come up with the following routine to improve the condition of my skin:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# ROUTINE\n\n**MORNING**\n\n* Cleanser \\(Step I\\): **Bioderma Sensibio H2O micellar water** \\(applied with a cotton pad\\)\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, PEG\\-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Propylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus \\(Cucumber\\) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Bromide.\n* *Moisturiser \\(Step I\\):* **Lumene Hydration Recovery Oxygenation** **gel** **mask**\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, Propanediol, Betula Alba \\(Birch\\) Juice, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth\\-20, Phenoxyethanol, Rubus Chamaemorus \\(Cloudberry\\) Seed Extract, Acrylates/c10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Peg\\-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Trehalose, Urea, Eriophorum Spissum Flower/Stem Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium Edta, Copper Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Pentylene Glycol, Serine, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Algin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Pullulan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha\\-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Citronellol, Parfum \\(Fragrance\\), \\(Ci 42090\\) Blue 1, \\(Ci 60730\\) Ext.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

        "body": "Maskholic here, checking in. \n\nI usually do a mask everyday, it’s my favorite part of my routine. My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

It's also prone to acne - clogging, cc's, pustules and occasionally nodules mostly on the T-zone. Ethylhexyl palmitate, coconut oil and moringa oil are some of the worst offenders ingredients wise when it comes to acne.\n\nOther things to keep in mind: I have quite noticeable PIE and PIH, my skin is textured and dry, and I live in Aus so not everything's available here.\n\nI'm about to run out of my old non cruelty free moisturizer which I suspect might contribute to some of my CC's.\n\nIngredients Here\nhttp://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_db23245943.html",

The African black soap line is meant for dry, acne prone skin and it is ~natural~ so I would give it a go. It honestly has SAVED me. If I want something a bit more moisturizing, I use a facial oil I make myself. 2 parts jojoba oil, 1 part Rose hip oil, tea tree essential oil, and Rosemary essential oil. Rosemary and tea tree are great for acne prone skin. Rosehip oil is great for aging and scarring skin. Both rosehip and jojoba oil are noncomedogenic so they don't make me break out more (I have oily and acne prone skin). 💓",

The person I talked to (Jackie) said they are working on switching over to manufacturing their own products, so that's why they have different ingredients list for the different batches. I expressed concerns that I wanted to avoid certain ingredients due to sensitivities and Jackie said, \"If you email me your order number after you place your order, I can make sure you get the products with the ingredients you want.\" and they gave me their email address.  I placed my order as usual, then wrote an email with the subject line \"special request order #xxxxxx\" to Jackie directly after and she got everything perfectly right.\n\nSO incredibly helpful!\n\nI got the Hot Mama blush with these ingredients:\nMICA, BORON NITRIDE, POLYETHYLENE, ISOEICOSANE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SILICA, POLYISOBUTENE, PTFE, SYNTHETIC WAX, DIMETHICONE, SODIUM DEHYDROACETATE, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891), CARMINE (CI 75470), IRON OXIDE (CI 77491).\nhttps://thebalm.com/collections/cheeks/products/hotmama\n\nMary Lou Manizer Travel and Full Size Highlight with these ingredients:\nMICA, ISOEICOSANE, POLYETHYLENE, BORON NITRIDE, POLYISOBUTENE, PTFE, SILICA, SYNTHETIC WAX, SODIUM DEHYDROACETATE, DIMETHICONE, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891), IRON OXIDE (CI 77491).\nhttps://thebalm.com/products/mary-lou-manizer-highlighter-shadow\n\nand I believe Balm Desert Bronzer only has one ingredient list, but just in case:\nMICA, DIMETHICONE, SYNTHETIC WAX, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, BORON NITRIDE, PTFE, KAOLIN, SODIUM DEHYDROACETATE, ISOEICOSANE, POLYETHYLENE, SILICA, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891), BISMUTH OXYCHLORIDE (CI 77163), IRON OXIDES (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), CARMINE (CI 75470), MANGANESE VIOLET (CI 77742), RED 7 LAKE (CI 15850).\nhttps://thebalm.com/products/balm-desert?_pos=2&_sid=6c90335e2&_ss=r\n\nSome of their other products may have also been FA-safe but those were the only ones I got this time around.\n\nI would suggest trying to contact chat before placing an order to confirm that they can hand select the correct products for you. I'm hoping they keep the formulas that have fungal safe ingredients, but I may order backups of the bronzer and highlight just in case since those two products have been hard for me to find in pressed versions. Loose highlight and bronzer are fine if I'm not in a rush or traveling, but pressed is also good to have!",

Bought for Rs. 999/- from Kult.\n\n**🌿Key Ingredients:** Glycerin, Niacinamide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Panthenol, Ceramides, Licorice.\n\n**🧪Ingredients:** Purified Water, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Pentylene Glycol, Synthetic Beeswax, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Lauryl Esters, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.025Ppm), Madecassoside (0.06Ppm), Asiaticoside (0.315Ppm), Madecassic Acid (0.4Ppm), Asiatic Acid (0.3Ppm), Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus Ferment Lysate (1759Ppm), Lactococcus Ferment Lysate (1759Ppm), Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Endomyces Ferment Filtrate, Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment, Panthenol, Ceramide NP, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Dipropylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Copernicia Prunifera (Carnauba) Wax, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Citric Acid, Adenosine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Phytate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Texture:** Thick White Cream\n\n**🧴Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** Yes\n\n**🧖🏻‍♀️My Experience:** First of all, My Skin is combination with oily T-zone all year round, but during winters, it falls on the drier side. That was why I decided to buy a Ceramide moisturizer that helps with barrier repair for the season, coz in other seasons, my skin can also tolerate gel based moisturizers. \n\nIt was definitely a great moisturizer for winters, but again, only for nighttime. The texture was too thick to be used during AM routine, which I did try for a few days, before using it solely for PM routine. \n\nWorked very well, Never faced any breakouts. Prior to this, I had tried Formulax Barrier Repair Moisturizer (the orange tube), which felt very light in texture compared to Unpa Cream, but gave me small bumps on my skin. Had to buy Benzoyl peroxide to deal with the aftermath. I faced none of these issues with Unpa Cream even though I felt their texture was thicker. My skin absorbed the product easily during night, didn't feel any greasiness and during mornings, lesser quantity application worked. \n\nNow, with winters leaving and summers approaching, I'm strictly using it during PM on very damp skin. Won't be purchasing again now.\n\n**Will I Recommend:** Yes, coz it can work on dry skins, but price range is quite high. \n\n**WRP:** No\n\n\n\n\n",

Her skin wasn't that bad before but you could see that it was dry, uneven, acne prone with large pores. Now it looked flawless. I thought she was using a new foundation but she said she wasn't wearing any makeup at all. Of course I immediately asked her how she got her skin like that and she told me she's been using this cream her friend recommended to her from the brand Sandra's Beauty. I have never heard of this brand before and when I went to googled it I found that it's from Vietnam. There weren't that much information on the cream, just two (five stars) reviews on Amazon. The thing that has me hesitant is the fact that the instruction in English weren't really...well good English (bad grammars, spelling, etc.) That makes me wonder how trustworthy this brand is. Has anyone here heard of or used anything from the brand? The cream is pretty expensive ($60) but I ordered a sample just to see what it's like and am currently waiting for it to be delivered. My cousin swore this was all she used and I saw the results myself, but I'm really picky about what to put on my face. Also, I wasn't able to find a full ingredient list for the product (another red flag), but this is a partial list from two websites\n\nKey ingredients: titanium dioxide, bee's wax, squalane, arbutin, ginseng extract, bacillus ferment, allantoin\n\nComposition:\nGinseng Extract, Lanolin Oil, Carnaba Wax, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide, Collagen. \n\nAny information/opinions/thoughts are appreciated",

My experience of a product with a bunch of titanium dioxide is that it always gives my skin an evenness that can verge on uncanny because it doesn't sink in - it goes over the texture and pigmentation issues like a physical camouflage.\n\nIf I'm right, you could probably get a similar effect from a less expensive product with lots of titanium dioxide. I've wanted to try the [Lei Lani Wear White Finishing cream](http://www.wishtrend.com/make-up/1140-wear-white-face-whitening-finisher-lei-lani-.html?ckattempt=1#.Vh5crRC9ZSw) for this reason, but haven't yet.\n\nAnd if I am right - it isn't necessarily that the Sandra's Beauty is improving the skin by leaps and bounds and oodles.

    "body": "I've been on the hunt for a great moisturiser for years, and wanted to share some product reviews as lately I think there have been more fake product reviews because so many products seems to get 4.5+ stars.\n\nI have acne-prone, sensitive, pale skin. I use tret 0.025 every other day which causes redness. Other than moisturiser and tret, I use: Sebamed foaming cleanser, Beausta Cicarecipe toner, CosRX snail mucin, CosRX Propolis Honey Toner, and for SPF I use Facetheory Amil-C whip.\n\nI use incidecoder and avoid anything with Ethylhexyl Palmitate (causes breakouts for me)\n\n1. Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream has been my HG for a few years, but it's just been re-formulated and I don't like the new ingredient list.\n2. Kiehl's ultra facial oil-free gel cream: This was nice, but not hydrating enough for me. It didn't seem to cause breakouts, but I only used it for a few days. It didn't leave any oily sheen.\n3. Biossance omega+squalene. This sat on my skin and looked greasy. It didn't hydrate my skin at all, and my face was dry-looking in the morning.\n4. Cerave moisturising cream: I'm really surprised that this is so popular. For me, it wasn't hydrating at all. It left my skin matte, but dry.\n5. Cicaplast Baume B5: similar to the Cerave. Thick and didn't feel hydrating. Also left my skin greasy\n6. LANEIGE CICA SLEEPING MASK: I only had a tester of this, but it felt really nice and definitely reduced redness. I'm going to buy a travel size.\n7. SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. VITAMIN C RICH HYDRATION CREAM: Again, only had a tester. Felt nice but I don't think it's worth the price\n8. BYOMA MOISTURISING GEL CREAM: Nice, but not hydrating enough with tret. Good ingredient list though. \n9. Aveeno calm and restore oat gel moisturiser: I like this but I've only used it a few times. It feels light and hydrating, without leaving my skin shiny. \n10. Purito B5 Panthenol re-barrier cream: Feels nice but definitely left skin shiny. \n11. Facetheory Ceraquench Moisturiser: I liked this for a night cream but something in it broke me out\n12. Facetheory Amil-C whip: This is my daily SPF. It sits nicely on top of moisturiser, but doesn't work well with make-up in my experience. \n\nOthers that I've seen recommended that are non-comedogenic that I'm planning on trying next are:\n\n1. Aveeno Calm + Restore Skin Therapy Balm\n2. Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-peptide Cream\n3. La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer\n4. PURITO - Dermide Relief Barrier Moisturizer  \n",

Here is the product ingredients as provided by the manufacturer. The first thing that jumped out at me was Isopropyl Palmitate. In the past I have broken out severely from ethylhexyl palmitate. I have no idea if the Isopropyl Palmitate was the culprit in this case.... but I'm wondering if this is a comedogenic ingredient or whether this means I may be reacting to ingredients that aren't fungal acne safe? If anyone has any insights this would be much appreciated as it would save me a headache with trialing products in the future!  \n\n\nJust FYI a reply from cancer council when asked about the comeodogenic ingredients in their sunscreens: \"Non-comedogenic (com-ee-do-gen-ic) is the term used to describe a product that does not block your pores. Our Face Day Wear Fluid SPF50+ is the only one described as non-comedogenic.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7iv5h6a9pzb1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=52bcf5fb58829cbcc3855f079110417c9d9c9ab3",

I get the impression there are lots of different active ingredients out there, but I also sense that at least some of them are total nonsense. (\"Green tea extract to revitalize your skin with antioxidant power!\")\n\nI looked at the subreddit's moisturizer recommendations. I saw Cerave cream at the top. Its ingredients seem to be: \"Water (Purified), Glycerin, Ceteareth 20, Capric/Caprylic Stearic Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methylsulfate/Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6 11, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\"\n\nI'm currently using this: \"Water (Aqua), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycolic Acid, PEG-100 Stearate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Benzophenone-3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Dipalmitoyl Hydroxyproline, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Wheat Amino Acids, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, Fragrance (Parfum), Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\"\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to ask is — are there any OTC substances that have actually been shown to improve skin health? I've heard \"retinols\" mentioned, and found an article or two, but that's about it.\n\nIn case \"skin health\" needs to be qualified, I guess I'd explain my situation as follows. I have \"young, healthy\" skin. (I'm not really sure if my skin is \"dry\" or \"oily\", but I guess it's more the latter?) It's my understanding that skin tends to deteriorate with age. I'd like to minimize that. I realize that there are lots of \"anti-aging\" products out there designed to repair aged skin and restore it to a more \"youthful\" state. My intuition tells me that it's easier to prevent aging than to fix it once it happens, so even though I'm pretty happy with my skin, I figure I ought to get started. However, I have no clue what actually has been found to work.",

I used to think that there were no products that could actually improve the appearance of your skin.  But since discovering this sub, I found that there are ingredients with scientific proof that they work.\n\nI don't have a comprehensive list with articles, but I can provide a starting point for your search.  If you look around this sub you will find information and you can also try searching Google scholar for articles.\n\nIn the case of CeraVe, the 'special' ingredients are the ceramindes and the hyaluronic acid (maybe cholesterol too). You can search google to find out about how they exactly work.\n\nAs already mentioned, [AHA as well as BHA ](http://www.labmuffin.com/2012/02/lab-muffin-guide-ahas-vs-bhas.html) are beneficial, BUT they need to be at the [correct pH](http://www.labmuffin.com/2014/05/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter.html) in order to work and many companies don't bother with this.  And after applying an AHA or BHA, it is best to let it sit on the skin for 5-30 minutes before applying moisturizer or rinsing. That means face washes with salicylic acid (a BHA) are not really  beneficial.  This is just an example of how an ingredient is only beneficial if it is used correctly.\n\nVitamin C is another product which has been shown to be beneficial.  [Here is a thread where it is being discussed](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1lfm47/diy_vitamin_c_serum_a_really_full_explanation/) with information about the correct pH as well as some articles listed in the comments section.\n\nOne more ingredient to search for is [retinol](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/anti-aging/_/retinol-for-anti-aging) which has been proven to increase cell turnover for younger looking skin.\n\nThis sub is pretty good about finding the science behind why certain ingredients work. It took me months to get through all of the information on here and I'm still learning new things almost every day.",

However, I keep encountering comedogenic ingredients high on the ingredients list. \n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nComedogenic ratings, as per Inci Decoder, are bracketed after the ingredient on a 0-5 scale.\n\n|Cleanser| Comedogenic ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser|[Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol) (2),  [Stearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearyl-alcohol) (2),  [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol) (2),  [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate) (1-2)|\n|La Roche Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser| [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate) (2-4)|\n|Eucerin Dermatoclean Mild Cleansing Milk| [Isopropyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/isopropyl-palmitate) (3-4),  [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol) (2),  [Glyceryl Stearate Se](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate-se) (3)|\n\nMany of these ingredients are emollients. As I understand it, they are what make these cleansers feel moisturising, and they leave behind a \"film\" on the skin. If these ingredients are being left behind on the skin, are they not going to clog us up? I am aware that YMMV, but still, I would prefer to have ingredients with lower comedogenic ratings (0-1) high up on the ingredients list. \n\nSo can anyone suggest creamy/milky cleansers without these comedogenic ingredients? (Preferably available in the UK, e.g. Vanicream is not available here).",

Its made with rice, honey, kaolin and other preservatives and ranges between 13€-23€.\n\nBut is it really worth it? You can make your own rice mask with whole grain rice flour, honey and water. Is this mask a waste of money if you can make it yourself? \nI would buy this mask because it’s marketed as rice and honey mask, not some hydrating or exfoliating whatever ingredient I likely already have in my skincare… \n\nThe alcohol in the ingredients, which can be read twice, is also a bit concerning.\n\nOf course if you’re lazy and don’t like to make a new rice mask every time, I would buy this product. But if you wanna save money and have a few extra minutes once or twice a week I would stick to the DIY one. \n\n\n\nPls share your thoughts!\n\n\n\n\n(I have dry sensitive skin, redness concern)\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Kaolin, Honey, Glycerin, Propanediol, Dipropylene Glycol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Hull Powder, Isononyl Isononanoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Lees Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Honey Extract, Bentonite, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cellulose, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyacetophenone, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylate-13, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Sodium Phytate, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Menthyl Lactate\n\n\n\nThe picture is from the official BOJ website.\n",

I said please issue my refund and they are now claiming that I needed to track it. I said, “Well nowhere in your instructions “How do I make a return” on your website does it say that I had to track the order back to you.” It slyly lists it under “How are refunds processed.” So Instead of asking for tracking, I followed their lousy instructions and just shipped it at the post office and put the Return number with the packing slip in the box, as indicated by your website. They REFUSE to give me a refund now and they won’t call their “3rd party warehouse” to check to see if my package is there! It says Murad on it and the RA number, like figure it out!  I hate companies that make billions of dollars and then screw you over for THEIR problems.

I've got closed comedones scattered near my chin/jawline and enlarged pores. \n\nI'm ingredient obsessed and also relatively paranoid about what I use, so after checking them both, I see that they contain 'Ethylhexyl Palmitate' which is considered extremely comedogenic. The VT reedle shot also contains a couple of other comedogenic ingredients.\n\nThe MC One Day Exosome has seemingly less ingredients, and the Ethylhexyl palmitate is the only comedogenic one. This is more appealing to me for that reason alone.\n\nPlease share your experiences using these products. I know everyone reacts differently, but if anyone has a similar skin type/skin concerns as me and have used these.. I'd appreciate it 😊",

This is why I haven’t, while very tempted, to try any of the VT Reedle variations.  The Medicube Exosome Shot, however, I somehow missed the Ethelhexyl Palmitate on the ingredient list!  It is tho not at the top but more at the bottom half of the ingredient list. It is one ingredient I avoid like the plague which is why I avoid cleansing oils that have it as the 1st ingredient all the while claiming to be for acne. Marketing lies. However, since I missed the fact that the Medicube Exosome Shot does have this dreaded ingredient (but not at the top), I bought used it and am on my third bottle of the 2000 strength feathering in the 7500 strength.  I have had NO clogs or breakouts.  My skin, unlike most tho, can take and likes the AHA & exfoliating acids in this shot.  I even follow the MC Exosome Shot with a palm-ful mix of Naturium’s Glycolic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Azelaic Acid & Tranexemic Acid and Alpha Arbutin (a pump of each just mixed together in my palm) after the MC Exsome Shot has been absorbed. Followed by Rejuran Healer serum, sealed in at the end with Heveblue gel-cream moisturizer daily. My skin barrier is perfect and not a single breakout. Had I not missed the Ethelhexyl Palmitate, I might not have bought the MC Exosome Shot. I am so glad I bought it. It did not break me out or cause clogs even tho this ingredient usually equals a breakout.  My guess is the AHA/BHA in the formulation negate the bad side affects of Ethelhexyl Palmitate yet maintaining the benefits of a spicule product.  Hope this long answer helped!",

I've never had such a good result from a balm so I've never bothered with them before.  I get large areas in the middle of my lips that are not dry enough to bother me, but just dry enough to make the texture of my lipstick look bad, and no balm I've used aside from this one has done anything for it.

However, I am interested to know whether there is some science behind the claims made by many companies about their tanning accelerator creams. Not those that stain your skin but those marketed to actually increase melanin pigmentation through exposure to the sun.\n\nI tried searching on pubmed but didn't find much information on the topic.

So I'm not sure about the products you listed, but there was one product I did find (in my post history, I think) where the main ingredient was L-Tyrosine and then looked into this amino acid more.\n\nL-Tyrosine is an amino acid necessary for the formation of melanin. However, it is also a precursor to dopamine. There is a subreddit of folks looking into supplements for a boost of energy and many tried L-Tyrosine. Some reported that when they took L-Tyrosine they found that they happened to tan 'easier' to sun exposure in addition to a temporary energy boost. \n\nIDK how effective L-Tyrosine is when you apply it to the skin, though, I never tried it. Additionally I cannot say whether it is safe to ingest for extended periods of time due to its role in dopamine production (and also melanin production).\n\nI haven't looked at this topic in awhile but you can definitely look into L-Tyrosine and Dopamine biochem pathway and find articles related to that on pubmed!\n\nEdit: Just wanted to look into the topic more and found this article:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4345932/ states that ingesting tyrosine via pills or applying via cream has not been proven to work and is potentially dangerous, but couldn't find much else.\n\nSo, I'd be wary of products marketed towards accelerating tanning!",

    "body": "Hello!  I’ve been lurking around here for about a month now and I thought it was time I cleared my throat and introduced myself.\n\nAbout a year ago I decided that my decade-long skincare routine consisting of Philosophy Purity face wash twice a day followed by Hope In A Jar in the AM probably needed an update as I was turning thirty.  This started me down a slippery slope of a skincare hobby.  I found Caroline Hirons’ (very much NOT AB) blog by way of the PixiWoo YouTube channel and since then I’ve been hungrily learning about skincare science.  Caroline’s tone is very inviting and she’s all about making skincare unintimidating.  You will never hear me badmouth her because she opened my eyes to a lot of things (#flannels4eva!), but in the last few months I’ve felt like I needed to cast a wider net.  I’d remembered stumbling on Skin and Tonics last year while looking into Sunday Riley facial oils and after poking around Kerry’s blog I felt completely lost and overwhelmed by the science of pH and the parade of unfamiliar products.  It sounded like a different language to me!\n\nFast forward to about a month ago and I found my way to this reddit community. I spent the first few weeks of my Kbeauty education reading through this reddit sub and some of the most well known AB blogs.  I’m not generally an internet “joiner”, but this is such a passionate, well-informed group of people here and I’d love to get to know you all.\n\nSkin type: I feel like I've spent the last year trying to decide if I’m oily or normal or dry or combo. Seriously, I change my mind weekly. When I started trying to use actives like glycolic acid (bad idea) and salicylic acid (love it) I very quickly realized that I have sensitive skin.  It was ugly and I’m pretty sure the only reason I got through the first few months without giving up on it all is because I’m incredibly hard-headed.  I’ve realized in the last year that I must have some hormonal imbalances because while I wouldn’t say I have acne in the traditional sense, I’ve definitely been getting cysts and occasional breakouts in the jawline area for the last several years.  Since trying so many different products I’ve also realized I’m prone to CCs.  Still trying to suss out the problematic ingredients.  Right now I’m trying to stay away from mineral oil, high concentrations of silicones and denatured alcohol.  I’m also taking note of any products with coconut oil and palm oil and their related ingredients.\n\nThe existing non-AB part of my skincare wardrobe:\n\n**CLEANSERS**\n\nEmma Hardie Moringa Cleansing Balm\n\nTata Harper Oil Cleanser\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Cleanser\n\n**ACIDS**\n\nBiologique Recherche P50W 1970\n\nPC Resist 2% BHA Daily Pore-refining Treatment\n\nSunday Riley Good Genes Treatment\n\nSilk Naturals 8% AHA\n\n**TONER**\n\nJanuary Labs Spray Toner\n\nClinique Moisture Surge Face Spray\n\n**SERUMS**\n\nKypris Antioxidant Dew\n\nHylamide C25 Booster\n\nEstee Lauder ANR II\n\nSkinceuticals Retinol 0.5\n\n**MOISTURIZER**\n\nJanuary Labs Lotion\n\nGlossier Priming Moisturizer\n\n**FACE OILS**\n\nSunday Riley Juno\n\nClarins Lotus Oil\n\nAcure Marula Oil\n\n**SPF**\n\nElta MD Clear SPF 46\n\nLa Roche Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral Ultra Light Sunscreen\n\nAfter looking closely at the products I’ve used most recently, I realized a few of them have probably been causing my CCs (obviously) and possibly even allergic reactions. I’ve cut out of my routine a moisturizer with coconut oil high on the list, a cleanser with Ethylhexyl Palmitate in the #1 position, and an eye cream with too much alcohol.  I’m determined to get to the bottom of this.\n\nI held off a good ten days before I kind of went crazy with ordering products.  I’ve now made orders through Glow Recipe, SokoGlam, Memebox, HKCPlaza, and Amazon and here’s what I’ve added...\n\n**Banila Clean It Zero Purity** - I bought this to take the place of the Emma Hardie as a cheaper option for a first cleanse.  So far so good!\n\n**COSRX Low-pH Good Morning Cleanser** -  I haven’t used a foaming cleanser in a very long time, so that’s a little strange to get used to again, but I’m happy to find a great, simple option for $10.\n\n**Whamisa Organic Flowers Deep Rich Essence Toner** - This was the first thing I added to my routine and it’s absolutely fantastic! Yeah it’s pricey but it’s good-ingredient pricey and I’m good with that.\n\nProducts that are in my possession and are staring at me, beckoning me…\n\n**COSRX BHA Power Liquid** - I’ve used this once and I am definitely pinning my hopes and dreams on this one, so it better work. Just kidding. Sort of.\n\n**COSRX Snail 96 Mucin Essence** - I received this yesterday and I used it last night and this morning after the world’s lamest attempt at a patch test of about four hours on my forearm last night. No bad reactions so far and I feel nicely hydrated!\n\n**LJH Tea Tree Essence** - Yay for anti-irritants! Also, my first experience with ordering directly from Asia. I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived from Singapore (HKCPlaza) in eleven days.\n\n**LJH Vita Propolis Ampoule** - Very excited about the prospects of this one, too.\n\n**Shara Shara AIO Honey Bomb Ampoule** - I used it twice before I decided not to be reckless with this one.  I’ll add it into my routine in a few weeks.\n\n**Benton Aloe Propolis Gel** - I have no idea why I ordered this except that it was on sale and it seemed like a product I’d find a use for this summer.\n\n**Benton Honest TT Mist** - Anyone have a best-practice suggestion for this? Should it be a pH adjusting first toner for when my skin needs some TLC? \n\n**COSRX Oil-free Lotion with Birch Sap** - This seems like a great light moisturizer for summertime and it’s received such glowing reviews so I’m having to keep my grabby hands from opening the box and using it right away.\n\n**COSRX Rice Overnight Mask** - I bought this despite being a little nervous about the palm oil and cetearyl alcohol.\n\nYou’d think with thirteen new products I wouldn’t have a list of “wants” already, but that’s assuming logic has any part in these decisions.  Here’s what remains on my AB wishlist…\n\nRosette Ceramide Gel (or Dr. Jart + Ceramidin Liquid?)\nHoly Snails samples—all of them!\nBeauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream\nCremorlab T.E.N. Cleansing Gel Oil \nGoodal Super Seed Oil Balancing \nIOPE Bio Essence Intensive Conditioning\n\n\n**TL;DR**: I’m really excited about AB skincare and apparently that means I get incredibly long-winded.  My apologies!  Hello, and I look forward to interacting with you all.\n\nAny thoughts on what I’ve added so far?  Suggestions?  Have you fallen asleep since you began reading this?  Please be kind to a reddit newbie as I'm still learning the ropes.",

        "body": "Hello and welcome! Thank you for being so thorough with your post, but I would also suggest that you posit questions in the stickied Daily Help Thread at the top of the sub for the future :) \n\nI'm going to be a bit of a downer here and voice my opinion of Caroline Hirons: she's knowledgeable, but incredibly unfairly biased against cheaper products and mineral oil. With the former, she's sent high-end skincare products all the time to review and will occasionally mention high-street or drugstore brands in passing to appear unbiased, and with the latter subject of mineral oil (unless you have a skin sensitivity) - her hatred towards it is unwarranted. In theory, pharmaceutical grade mineral oil is the least comedogenic of all oils; plant oils have a much higher chance of causing acne. \n\nFIRST OF ALL, if you suspect that your acne is hormonal, products are NOT the cure. You need to approach the problem internally - whether through a doctor and/or through supplements and other lifestyle changes. \n\nOk, got that out of the way. Your non-AB products actually look solid to me unless: \n\nA. You are trying to find cheaper alternatives, which AB products often provide    \nB. You are looking to find products that won't cause acne\n\nBarring the products that did not work for you, your western products are SOLID. AB does not necessarily mean better. You already have some great cleansers, great chemical exfoliants, great serums, and great oils. I would have suggested that you only explore new non-clogging moisturizer options to begin with while you figure out what ingredients in your western routine is giving you trouble, but since the new products have already been bought, let's go through the list: \n\n> Banila Clean It Zero Purity    \n\nGreat choice to replace a more expensive balm cleanser - it works for a lot of people with clog-prone skin. \n\n> COSRX Low-pH Good Morning Cleanser    \n\nThis causes acne and irritation in some people - the Glossier milky jelly cleanser, in my opinion, is still the better non-stripping option and does not cost much more than the Cosrx. \n\n> Whamisa Organic Flowers Deep Rich Essence Toner     \n\nGlad this is working for you. \n\n> COSRX BHA Power Liquid    \n\nThis is formulated with betaine salicylate - a weaker form of salicylic acid - and unless you find your current acids too strong, this will probably not be more effective for you. If you however need a more gentle and more frequent treatment, this might just be for you. I do however need to say that after having tried a myriad of chemical exfoliators, western brands still make them the best. BR, PC, and SN acids are some of my favorites. Cosrx BHA did nothing for me. \n\n> COSRX Snail 96 Mucin Essence    \n\nMany people have great luck with this - give it another two weeks in isolation testing. No new products added. \n\n> LJH Tea Tree Essence    \n\nI use this as well - some find it helpful for acne and some don't. Others say that you won't appreciate how much it does for your skin till you run out. \n\n> LJH Vita Propolis Ampoule, Shara Shara AIO Honey Bomb Ampoule, Benton Aloe Propolis Gel    \n\nPut yourself on a testing schedule - at least a week or two for each added product. These can be considered fluff products in your routine.\n\n> Benton Honest TT Mist    \n\nThis is just a mist to refresh your skin or to layer between steps. Nothing special. It's not pH-adjusting and you really don't need a pH adjusting toner anyway unless your chemical exfoliators are not working well enough. Mists can be useful to aid in absorption of sticky products and for added hydration through the day - I have a million of them and love 'em all.   \n\n> COSRX Oil-free Lotion with Birch Sap    \n\nWait on this. By the time summer comes around, it should be about the right time to test this. \n\n> COSRX Rice Overnight Mask    \n\nThis product gives me the ultimate bounce and glow but if you were concerned about its ingredients, you should hold off and figure out what's wrong with your routine right now instead of adding it. \n\nDON'T BUY ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT NOW. If anything, your skin could be dehydrated if you're overdoing acids and are varying between normal-oily-combo. You bought a lot of fluff products that may or may not improve or worsen your skin beforehaving a confident cleansers-moisturizer-sunscreen routine. Figure out what to fix first before buying more products when you have not yet found your skin triggers.",

It sounds like you have done a lot of reading, and you certainly have some great products, but please of course heed the advice given so often here of patch testing & only introducing a new product every 2 weeks or so. It will be especially important for you to start slow as you suspect your previously used products are giving you problems. I threw all the AB at my face over the course of a month or so about a year ago & then had to drop everything as my skin just didn't jive with a full 10 step routine. Start with the basics (1st cleanse, 2nd cleanse, moisturizer, SPF) then introduce the \"fun\" stuff. It is, as you said, a hobby! I hope you enjoy the journey as much as the destination :)",

She gave the product 6 stars out of 7. The product has a total 5 out of 7 stars on cosme.net with 512 reviews. It's ranked 2nd on cosme.net under the Gel/Cream Eyeshadow category.\n\n>I bought the limited edition color Sheer Apricot.\n>This eyeshadow has 2 colors (2 textures??), a cream and a powder.\n>It's described as a combination of an adhesive gel cream and a fit powder for shading.\n>Maquillage had a similar one a while ago that came with an applicator that I really liked.\n>Looking at it, it stands out because it's small and easy to carry and the packaging is cute ♪\n\n>When you apply the cream, it glides on really easily and has a smooth texture.\n>You can use this as a base too, which saves time.\n>(I always use a base under my eyeshadows)\n>The powder has an interesting consistency! It's really moist when you touch it with your finger.\n>What is this? I wonder if there are a lot of moisturizing ingredients in it.\n>Because usually powders fly all over the place.\n>This isn't like that at all so it can go straight from your fingertip to your eyelid without making a mess.\n>It's wonderful not having any fallout!!\n>Please test out this moist powder for yourself. Lol\n\n>It's a pretty light, yellow-based color so I was worried if it would show up at all. \n>But as you can see from the pictures, it is conservative, but it creates a beautiful nude eye look! (in my opinion lol)\n>And it's sheer. It really has that \"transparency\" that's so trendy right now. LOL\n>Conservative and elegant are the perfect words to describe it. But it's so beautiful when you glance down ♪\n>It's so glossy, as if it's wet.\n>It's perfect for when you want to subtly emphasize your eyes ♪\n>Like when you want your lip color to be the focus.\n\n>Since the base color is a cream, the shadow doesn't crease or fade.\n>Furthermore, this product is waterproof!! I was so surprised!!\n>I really like Integrate products lately.\n>They're reasonably priced and excellent quality.\n>As to be expected from Shiseido.\n\n>This doesn't come with an applicator so I use my finger, but because it's so small I feel like it'll be hard to use up the last of the product. Even if it costs 100 yen more, I think it'd be nice if there was an applicator included for the cream. (Like that Maquillage product I mentioned ♪)\n\n>But it's really an excellent eyeshadow.\n>I want to try the other colors, too!\n\n>PIC [1](http://cdn-cosme.net/media/collection/209/729/4516197_wl.jpg), [2](http://cdn-cosme.net/media/collection/209/729/4516196_wl.jpg)\n\nI also translated the ingredients list from the [official website](http://www.shiseido.co.jp/sw/products/SWFG070410.seam?shohin_pl_c_cd=669901):\nMETHYL TRIMETHICONE, TRIMETHYLSILOXYSILICATE, CERESIN, DIPHENYLSILOXY PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, SILICA, CALCIUM ALUMINUM BOROSILICATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, DIISOSTEARYL MALATE, DISTEARDIMONIUM HECTORITE, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 DIMETHICONE, MACADAMIA INTEGRIFOLIA SEED OIL, TOCOPHEROL, TIN OXIDE, ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE, METHYLPARABEN, MICA, TITANIUM DIOXIDE, SYNTHETIC FLUORPHLOGOPITE, IRON OXIDES\n\nThis color is so pretty!

    "body": "i've been contemplating and over thinking this post for far too long now, i'm new to SCA and i have plenty of unrelated questions but i didn't want to spam the community, so for now i've decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

        "body": "Alright, first thing I’d say is find and stick to a simple routine for now and once your skin is where you want it, you can experiment with trying different products. Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, there are many companies for example, The Ordinary that are making great products that are inexpensive. \n\nYour lucky you don’t really have acne prone skin so here’s the routine I’d recommend to you for blackhead:\n\nAM:\nGentle cleanser - I’d recommend CeraVe ($10.98)  \n\n\nSerum/Acids: For blackheads Id recommend - The Ordinary Niacinimide 10% + zinc 1% as its gentle and is known to un-clog pores. Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

        "body": "Of your list, I've only used the fresh soy cleanser and the caudalie products. But I looked up some of the Pacifica and Philosophy products on cosdna.com and the ingredients on those seem fine too. \n\nPersonally, I like to alternate my products a lot but that's because I know they all work for me/ don't break me out. I think the best thing for you would be to pick a cleanser and moisturizer now and then swap them out for your others if it's not working for you. \n\n**Cleanser** (Morning and night, pick one to start with, then swap it out for another one. If none of them cause breakouts, you can just alternate which one you use)   \n\n- e.l.f. daily face cleanser w/ purified water\n- philosophy purity made simple (this one is moisturizing)\n- fresh soy face cleanser (this one is mild and a good one to start with)\n\n**Deep Cleanser** (I would probably only use this 1-2 a week in place of your regular cleanser because they seem more harsh on your skin. I would wait to start these after you get used to a daily cleanser)  \n\n- pacifica kale detox deep cleaning face wash\n- purity the microdelivery exfoliating facial wash\n\n**Serum**\n\n- caudalie vinoperfect radiance serum \n\n**Moisturizers** (Pick one and use it morning and night) \n\n- pacifica dreamy youth day and night face cream\n- philosophy renewed hope in a jar (this one has great reviews, maybe start here)\n- caudalie vinosource moisturizing sorbet \n\n**Occlusive** (use this at night for dehydrated skin, damaged moisture barrier)  \n\n- Vaseline (You might already had this at home so you don't have to buy more things)\n- Facial oil (if you have olive oil, sunflower seed, argan oil, jojoba oil, etc, it might be a good place to start.) \n\n**DIY Masks** (You can make nice masks with stuff you might already have at home)  \n\n- Ground up oatmeal + honey + yogurt/milk. This makes my skin really moisturized and glowy. \n- plain yogurt or milk makes my skin look brighter and less dull\n- honey + green tea leaves\n- Turmeric powder. Add this to any of the above masks for a nice glow to your skin. (Skip if you're very pale because it might be too yellow) \n\n**Products to Try in the future**\n\n- Stridex pads in red box. It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun. You're young, but sun damage can really exacerbate all skincare issues down the road.",

    "body": "Was curious if anyone has tried the “by Humankind” aluminum free deodorant? I currently use Schmidt’s, and have tried Myro. Experiences below. \n\nI switched to Schmidt’s about a year ago and had some issues with tenderness and lumps at the beginning that I attributed to my body getting used to sweating again, and probably getting rid of the aluminum. For the most part it’s fine now, and I love the scent, but I have certain times where it really irritates my underarms. It might be irritation from shaving but I’m not sure. Other times it’s totally fine and I find it very effective in combating odor. However, I have also had issues with inconsistencies in their product, and bad customer service, so I have been on the lookout for something else. \n\nI once tried Myro which has no baking soda, and I liked the idea of a refillable container to cut down on plastic waste. However I found it really ineffective even after using for a week to let my body “get used to it.” I had to apply 3-4 times a day. It was also very thin and liquidy feeling. Not a fan!\n\nI saw an ad today for By Humankind and was intrigued. It’s a refillable package to cut down on waste, and has baking soda which I don’t mind, since I think that’s probably why I found the Schmidt’s more effective. Or maybe the coconut oil in Schmidt’s is what makes it more effective? Anyway, has anyone tried this brand?\n\nWas just curious on everyone experiences, or if there are any other brands you recommend. I included the ingredients for each one below in case anyone is interested. \n\nMyro -\nAqua/Water/Eau, Propanediol, Stearic Acid, Parfum/Fragrance*, Hordeum Vulgare Powder, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide, Isoeicosane, Polyisobutene, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Maltooligosyl Glucoside, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Dilauramidoglutamide Lysine, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxypropylsulfonate Laurylglucoside Crosspolymer, Arginine, Sodium PCA, Limonene\n\nBy Humankind -\nShea Butter, Arrowroot Powder, Squalane, Stearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Baking Soda, Sucrose Stearate, Tapioca Starch, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Zinc Oxide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Beeswax, Eucalyptus Scent Essential Oils: \nEucalyptus, Cedar, Lavandin,  Bergamot, Star Anise, Fir Needle\n\nSchmidt’s Lavender Sage -\nMarantha arundinacea (arrowroot) powder, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) wax, butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), caprylic/capric triglyceride (fractionated coconut oil), simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, lavandula (lavender) essential oil, salvia sclarea (clary sage) essential oil, tocopherol (vitamin E, sunflower derived).",

I know a lot of people on this reddit look for physical sunscreens due to sensitivity or maybe they use it on children, etc. The Innisfree eco safety waterproof one gets a lot of love on this reddit, but since that one was discontinued, I was looking for a new physical sunscreen. Memebox had the chica y chico Suntana for $15 instead of its usual $26, so I purchased it. \n\nI've tried this sunscreen for one week now. It is physical, spf 50, and uses zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Full ingredients are below this paragraph. FYI, I have normal to dry skin in the summer and dry skin in the winter. I am not acne prone, but I have LOTS of freckles/hyperpigmentation, which is why I am vigilant about sunscreen. This sunscreen was not overly matte or dry on my skin when I applied it by itself. It didn't make oil production go crazy. And it looked ever so slightly dry in certain patches when I applied bb cream and powder over it. However, I have dry patches on my chin, forehead area even in the summer so that's something to keep in mind. Another thing of note is that I reapply sunscreen throughout the day, and when I took a cotton pad with micellar water, swiped it across my face and then reapplied this Suntana sunscreen over my face in the middle of the day, it did not look cakey even though it was over some of my makeup and it did not break me out. There is a slight white cast, but no worse than other mineral sunblocks. And I didn't mind it. I am asian, and prefer to look slightly paler anyway, so that was a plus in my book. In summary, I think this is a great mineral sunscreen for anyone looking for a new one. \n\nWater, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Cyclohexasiloxane, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange Oil), Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Limonia Acidissima Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Mrytus Communis Oil, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Rose Flower Water, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Ferula Galbaniflua (Galbanum) Resin Oil, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Dimethicone/Methicone Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol",

    "body": "I've been on the hunt for a great moisturiser for years, and wanted to share some product reviews as lately I think there have been more fake product reviews because so many products seems to get 4.5+ stars.\n\nI have acne-prone, sensitive, pale skin. I use tret 0.025 every other day which causes redness. Other than moisturiser and tret, I use: Sebamed foaming cleanser, Beausta Cicarecipe toner, CosRX snail mucin, CosRX Propolis Honey Toner, and for SPF I use Facetheory Amil-C whip.\n\nI use incidecoder and avoid anything with Ethylhexyl Palmitate (causes breakouts for me)\n\nReviews:  \n1. Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream has been my HG for a few years, but it's just been re-formulated and I don't like the new ingredient list.  \n2. Kiehl's ultra facial oil-free gel cream: This was nice, but not hydrating enough for me. It didn't seem to cause breakouts, but I only used it for a few days. It didn't leave any oily sheen.  \n3. Biossance omega+squalene. This sat on my skin and looked greasy. It didn't hydrate my skin at all, and my face was dry-looking in the morning.  \n4. Cerave moisturising cream: I'm really surprised that this is so popular. For me, it wasn't hydrating at all. It left my skin matte, but dry.  \n5. Cicaplast Baume B5: similar to the Cerave. Thick and didn't feel hydrating. Also left my skin greasy  \n6. LANEIGE CICA SLEEPING MASK: I only had a tester of this, but it felt really nice and definitely reduced redness. I'm going to buy a travel size.  \n7. SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. VITAMIN C RICH HYDRATION CREAM: Again, only had a tester. Felt nice but I don't think it's worth the price  \n8. BYOMA MOISTURISING GEL CREAM: Nice, but not hydrating enough with tret. Good ingredient list though.   \n9. Aveeno calm and restore oat gel moisturiser: I like this but I've only used it a few times. It feels light and hydrating, without leaving my skin shiny.   \n10. Purito B5 Panthenol re-barrier cream: Feels nice but definitely left skin shiny.   \n11. Facetheory Ceraquench Moisturiser: I liked this for a night cream but something in it broke me out  \n12. Facetheory Amil-C whip: This is my daily SPF. It sits nicely on top of moisturiser, but doesn't work well with make-up in my experience. \n\n  \nOther non-comedogenic moisturisers that I've seen recommended that I'm planning on trying next are:  \n1. Aveeno Calm + Restore Skin Therapy Balm  \n2. Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-peptide Cream  \n3. La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer  \n4. PURITO - Dermide Relief Barrier Moisturizer",

    "body": "Beekman 1802 Buttermilk Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm\n\nI think one of the biggest takeaways I have had from trying/testing literal hundreds of skincare products over the past couple of years is that just because a product is an all out miss for me...that doesn’t mean it should be written off by everyone else. \n\nSure...there are products that are just poorly formulated, physically painful to use, or are just nonsensical in use/application. But, most everything can find a place in a certain routine. The Beekman 1802 Buttermilk Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm falls squarely into that category for me. \n\nFeaturing sunflower seed wax, goat’s milk, bifida ferment, milk protein, and shea butter...this super rich and nourishing feeling cleansing balm combines cleansing and nourishment into a single product.\n\nI’ll be honest in saying that this cleansing balm worked just fine for me over the past few weeks. It does a nice job of melting through sunscreen and excess oil. And while I am not a makeup wearer...the texture and emollient properties seem on par with other products claiming to remove makeup.\n\nOne of the things that was interesting about this cleansing balm is the total lack of scent either from additives or naturally occuring from the key ingredients. Rather than a creamy/milky scent that I was expecting...the Buttermilk Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm has an almost petroleum jelly/”industrial” scent that I wasn’t a huge fan of.\n\nBut, I think the result that has me steering away from this product in the future is the rinsing process/result after use. Whereas my favorite cleansing balms rinse cleanly yet without stripping/over drying the skin...this cleansing balm tends to leave a rather heavy oil/waxy feel behind.\n\nThis residue does rinse off with a bit more time/effort...but I could see those with oily skin really disliking the feel. I found my eye area particularly impacted by this as the amount of rubbing and massaging to fully rinse the product off sometimes left that area looking a bit red and overworked. \n\nThe result in combination with the comparatively high price considering the size makes this one that is just not for me. But, those with particularly dry skin or who are looking to incorporate milk proteins/nourishing emollients into their routine at all stages may appreciate this formulation. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Water (Aqua), Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, C10-18 Triglycerides, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Lauryl Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Caprae Lac (Goat Milk), Colostrum, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Lactose, Milk Protein, Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Honey, Eryngium Alpinum (Blue Thistle) Flower Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Symphytum Officinale Rhizome (Comfrey) Root Extract, Squalane, Whey Protein, Citric Acid, Glucose, Lecithin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate \n\nWhere To Buy (Ulta - $38.00 USD - 1.44oz): [https://www.ulta.com/buttermilk-makeup-melting-cleansing-balm?productId=pimprod2017544](https://www.ulta.com/buttermilk-makeup-melting-cleansing-balm?productId=pimprod2017544) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ehneq6fyzpq51.jpg?width=1337&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84ca4d2c70b61bd7942c25e35a3362ed241480b2",

I make sure to get an even layer of Product across my entire face and neck. \n\nWhy I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* You know the drill LOL! I introduced pretty much the entire Sweet Chef Skincare Line into my Routine to share my thoughts on each Product as well as the Brand as a whole.\n\nOverall Review:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Did I save the best of the Sweet Chef Skincare Line (in my eyes) for last…YUP LOL! I’ll go ahead and spoil this Review by saying this Moisture Boost Moisturizer was the stand-out for me from the entire Line. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The first thing that I noticed was the texture of this Product. Rather than being a regular cream…this consistency felt and looked slightly “whipped” in a way. Its a medium/heavy Moisturizer but it just had this light feeling to it that is hard to explain. I guess you could call it buttery??? Regardless, what this texture did is made the Product feel lighter on the Skin than it might be otherwise…and applying it was really easy/comfortable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Rather than focusing on a couple featured Ingredients like the Sheet Masks, Serum Shots, and Facial Mist…this Moisture Boost encompasses all of what makes Sweet Chef Products so unique. This Moisturizer has one of the most robust and diverse Ingredients Lists that I have ever seen…lets dig in to some of the highlights (Full Ingredients List below). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Niacinamide, Kale Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Beet Root Extract, Mushroom Stem Extract, Chinaberry Flower Extract, Panthenol, Turmeric Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ginseng Extract, Spirulina Extract, Coffee Seed Extract, Retinol, and Ascorbic Acid all make the List. It’s pretty incredible to see so many different Ingredients that pretty much target everything under the sun LOL. You even have multiple Active Ingredients here (Vitamin C and Retinol)…very interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* While this Ingredients List is very impressive, what I found the Sweet Chef Moisture Boost to be the best at is…well…moisture LOL! Even with the thicker consistency and emollient feeling upon initial application…after a few seconds this Product just SINKS into the Skin. I think that this is one quality that Sweet Chef as a Brand must have spent a lot of time perfecting. Nothing from this Brand left a sticky residue or felt heavy on the Skin! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Once on, the feeling of deep hydration with the added oil based/emollient feeling left me really impressed. I used this Product alone for the first week of use in the AM…and then again on the third week (outside fo that I was blending it with the various Sweet Chef Serum Shots). Even alone I felt that this Product was sufficient in provide some deep/long-lasting hydration since it seemed to “lock” everything in with a slight occlusive layer. \n\nOver the past month the Sweet Chef Moisture Boost has really won me over. The one thing I can say to “criticize” it is the finish that it leaves behind after application. If you remember…I commented on how the Peach & Lily Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream was a little on the matte/dry finish side (even though I found it to be very hydrating)? Well, this Moisture Boost falls similarly on the opposite side of the spectrum. I personally don’t mind the glowy/nearly oils finish that it provides…but I could absolutely see it being too much for a lot of people. It might even be a deal breaker for those with Oily/Combination Skin.\n\nHaving said that, I think maybe using a bit less than I do per application or mixing it with one of the Serum Shots will help to diminish that result and customize the look to your preference. If you are a fan of more lightweight Essence-like Moisturizers though…I think this one will simply be too heavy overall.\n\nI know I named the Peach& Lily Matcha Cream my new go-to only a couple of months ago…but this Sweet Chef Moisture Boost really shocked me with hoe impressive it is. I honestly haven’t spent as much time glancing in the mirror and saying “DANG!” as I have when using this Product. I have learned to love the glow (on most days) LOL!\n\nBut, one thing that solidified this Product’s new reign as my “I should probably always have a backup of this.” Product is the price. For all of the hydration, nourishment, and antioxidant power from this Moisturizer…Sweet Chef has priced it at $19.00 USD. That is less than half of the Peach & Lily Cream for the same amount of Product. And for me, they offer really similar Skincare benefits…just with a different finish. \n\nAs I mentioned above…this was hands down the most impressive Product in the Sweet Chef Skincare Line and one that I intend to keep in mind when I use up some of the other Moisturizers in my Stash. The brand as a whole has been so much fun to use. I love the ability to “play” with the Serum Shots to fit the needs of my Skin on a day-to-day basis...everything from the Line just makes a lot of sense for today’s trends/consumer. Some Products were better than others…but overall I could totally see each one being a good fit for the majority of people! \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Acephala Leaf Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Ganoderma Lucidum (Mushroom) Stem Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Panthenol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Adenosine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Phytate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Althaea Rosea Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Panax Ginseng Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Candida Bombicola/Glucose/Methyl Rapeseedate Ferment, Spirulina Platensis Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Oil, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Retinol, Salvia Hispanica Seed Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Caramel, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9g4hgxmr3p41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4531d2266c02e94574be7a3c35eda29e3c60e74",

        "body": "It's not normal. I burned myself with a product that had, among other things, lactic acid, and experienced something very similar. I was red for maybe an hour or so, and then would become inflamed again if I used certain products (nearly everything except sunscreen). It may be that you used it a lot of times in a row, rather than slowly introducing it once in a while, or maybe we both have weird skin that can't tolerate lactic acid. (Which should be naturally occurring acid. Which shouldn't be reactive at low percentages. Ugh. Frustration. Or maybe our skin can't tolerate the combination of stuff in the product. I wish I knew.)\n\nAnyways, a normal reaction to introducing lactic acid would be stinging/redness for maybe 15 minutes or less. Or at least, that's what I've read.\n\nMy reaction was about 2 weeks ago, and my skin is starting to settle down, though it still reacts a little bit to certain products. My wishes to you, hoping that your skin won't bother you! Do wear sunscreen over the next few weeks, and if you have any troubles, ibuprofen and benadryl are lovely. As well as a topical ointment. Nuetrogena Hydro Boost Gel has provided hydration without irritating my burn at all, as well. Best of luck with the healing. \n\nI don't know what you will decide, as I think it depends on your own judgement and experience, but I ended up returning my product, lol. I decided that even if my skin COULD build up a tolerance, I wasn't willing to put it through this again.",

    "body": "I'm so grateful for AB to have taught me how to take care of my face properly!! Thank you so much guys\n\nBut I have been struggling with a problem recently. I've been living in Korea for 2 years and since then I've tried many new (especially Korean) facial products. In the beginning of 2014, my routine was:\nCleanse: Cetaphil | Toner: Etude House Malgem Smoother | Essence: Innisfree Soybean Energy Essence | Lotion: Cetaphil Lotion | Bb cream: The Face Shop Power Perfection BB Cream. Sometimes the occasional sheet mask or mud mask (usually Innisfree).\n\nThis worked until a certain extent, when I started breaking out some and when I switched products in summer, I started breaking out a lot (using mostly highly fragranced Laneige/Iope products). It worsened dramatically when I started eating a lot of ice cream (anyone knows Korean Bingsoo? I ate that every day in summer...), yoghurt and milk. I have a history of being allergic to milk when I was younger, so cutting that out was the first thing I did. After that, I stopped the usage of any fancy face products, except for an oil cleanser (Body Shop), face cleanser (La Roche Posy Toleriane Dermo Cleanser) and moisturizer (Cetaphil Lotion during the day and Cetaphil Cream during the night), and the occasional usage of BB cream (Hanskin Super Magic BB Cream). \nI should also add that my face is *normal-dry*: mostly normal in summer and dry in winter.\n\nSince then, I have tried introducing many products. I will include a list of products that didn't work for me, including their ingredient lists.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion** (gave me closed comedones and a pimple): *Water, Butylene Glycol,

I'm still looking for a sunscreen that doesn't break me out (I didn't include all) and I just want my face to feel nice. Even though the Cetaphil works, it doesn't make my skin feel the best. I loved the feeling of the Hada Labo, but that didn't work for me in the end. If someone had a certain method of comparing the ingredients in some kind of way, or someone with the same experiences as me, I would love to hear from you!!",
