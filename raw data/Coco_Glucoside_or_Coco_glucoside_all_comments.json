    "body": "I’m 24 and I have sensitive/combo/acne prone skin. When I first met my dermatologist, he made me understand that I was doing too much and that I had a compromised skin barrier. He explained that a stinging sensation when you apply your moisturizer can be an indicator as well as random episodes of redness and breakouts. He also offered for me to go on birth control for my acne which I didn’t want to do. *(Scroll under my routine for my derm’s advice).*          \n            \nWent back in to see my dermatologist recently for a checkup and he was really impressed by my progress and said that my skin looked the best he’d seen it!!!        \n            \n           \n** My skincare routine:**        \n           \nAM:          \n1. Room temperature water rinse.      \n2. **Brandefy: Clinical Vit C + E + Ferulic Defend Serum** (dupe of skinceuticals).     \n3. **Murmure: Microflora cream** (prebiotics and probiotics).     \n4. **Innis free: Daily UV Defense Sunscreen spf 36** (no white cast, no pilling).      \n                 \nPM:           \n1. **The Ordinary: Glucoside Cleanser** (gentle surfactants).       \n2. **Dr Dennis Gross: Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel** (once a week).      \n3. **Murmure: Microflora cream** (prebiotics & probiotics).      \n4.  **A313: Vitamin A Pommade** (every other day / Retinyl Palmitate is a gentle retinoid).      \n       \n           \n**What my dermatologist advised me to do:**        \n        \n- Apply the Epiduo he prescribed 3 times a week and slowly work towards applying it every day (stopped after a couple weeks because my skin was peeling like crazy and felt like it was on fire).      \n       \n- Limit the exfoliating to max once a week (the skin already exfoliates itself naturally once a month).      \n       \n- Switch out my cleanser for a more gentle one like the Vanicream gentle cleanser or the Ordinary glucoside cleanser. And experiment with cleansing your face only in the evening.       \n       \n           \n**Having struggled for a while with my skin and being a bit of a geek, I did a lot of research and want to share what I learned:**       \n       \n- Retinoids thicken the dermis but they thin out the stratum corneum (where the skin microbiome lives)         \n        \n- The quality of the diet is very important because gut health has a huge impact on your skin’s health.      \n       \n- Non-ionic surfactants are usually gentler (look for: Coco Glucoside, Decyl Glucoside, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside…).      \n        \n- Try topical prebiotics and probiotics to support your skin barrier (both are important to work).       \n       \n- Look out for potential photosensitizing, poreclogging and irritating ingredients (that’s a whole post in itself).",

    "body": "Edit: I’ve removed product recommendations due to concerns over brand affiliations. I’m not affiliated with any brand but I can see how some may feel negatively towards this, especially considering some of the history on the sub for brands to exploit the readers here. \n\nI may make a separate post later with recommendations as well as a bit of a discussion around it for people who are looking for recommendations. \n\n—-\n\nHi guys!\n\nYears ago I wrote[ the sidebar'd piece about dehydrated skin that I still get tagged in today](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/22c4tf/dehydrated_skin_and_the_moisture_barrier_an/). I wanted to update that with some more detailed information and knowledge on why it happens, what is happening, et cetra. Hopefully this can replace that guide, since I feel like it was a bit too broad. :)\n\n---\n\nDehydration is characterized by a lack of hydration in the cellular system and intercellular channels of the skin. It is not a skin type, but a skin condition. It does not discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin types, and is frequently aggravated by lifestyle and skincare choices. \n\nTo understand skin dehydration, you need to first understand the role of the natural moisturizing factors (NMF) in skin hydration. The NMF is an invisible lipid composition that sits on the top layer of the stratum corneum (SC) as well as interwoven in the top most layers of corneocytes (skin cells), making up a part in what is considered the \"acid mantle\" of the skin. The term NMF first appeared in 1959, but was not universally adopted immediately. It is hydrosoluable (able to dissolve in water) and hygroscopic (able to retain water), composed of about 40% free amino acids, 12% pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA), 12% lactates, 8.5% sugars/peptides/inorganic acids, 7% urea, 6% chloride, 5% sodium, and various small amounts of other materials. \n\nIt serves three major functions:\n\n1.  Protecting skin from damage\n2.  Encouraging desquamation (exfoliation of the upper most layer of corneocytes)\n3.  Controlling permeability of the SC\n\nThe NMFs are very effective natural humectants, drawing moisture to the skin from the atmosphere, even at humidity as low as 50%. \"Hydrated NMF forms ionic interacts with keratin fibers, reducing the intermolecular forces between the fibers and thus increasing the elasticity of the stratum corneum.\"² This keeps the skin healthy and supple in appearance. It also serves to prevent excessive water influx (see the third major function above), such as when your skin wrinkles from being in the bath or shower for too long, which causes the corneocytes to shrink. \n\nWhile it is often thought that the stratum corneum is \"dead\" tissue, it still requires water to function effectively. The NMF serves to provide for this, drawing and holding much of the water required. For example, enzymes that cause skin cells to exfoliate away naturally, by breaking the various bonds holding corneocytes together, need water to do their job effectively. \n\nReduction or stripping away of the NMF results in dry skin ([known as xerosis](https://imgur.com/vBOb07w)), scaling, flaking, as well as fissuring and cracking ([such as severely cracked and dry heels](https://imgur.com/C0F7BKK)). It can also result in what we refer to as \"dehydrated skin\" (though this is not a medical term).\n\n* * *\n\nWhat Dehydration Feels Like\n===========================\n\nDehydrated skin is one of the more difficult conditions to diagnose because it is frequently invisible. There are many \"tips\" online about how to diagnose dehydrated skin, such as pinching the back of your hand to see how quickly the skin snaps back into place. *It's important to keep in mind that this only serves to show if your body is dehydrated. Dehydrated skin usually has less to do about the hydration inside of your body and more to do with how we treat the skin topically or the atmosphere around us.* This is why someone with dehydrated skin can pinch the back of their hand and see their skin immediately pop back into place, yet feel horrible irritation on their skin when applying a simple moisturizer.  \n\n[The skin usually looks dry, scaly, or flaky](https://imgur.com/cLTwbTf), and feels \"tight\" (such as after using a harsh cleanser). When pulled very gently, [it can appear to crinkle](https://imgur.com/8RRFIfj) (not to be confused with crepey skin, such as the skin appearance around joints), and can even look like it has a very thin layer of skin sitting atop the upper most layer of skin. In some people, it feels itchy. It is usually most evident on the forehead or nose. It can also look lackluster, dull, and lack \"bounce\" and suppleness. In some, it can take the form of crinkly but very shiny skin, usually due to abuse of skin remodelers like AHAs or BHAs. \n\nBoth dry and oily skin types can be dehydrated - dry skin because it struggles to hold onto moisture and oily because sufferers frequently use harsh cleansers or astringents to gain relief. According to Milady's Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary, \"When oily skin becomes dehydrated, the surface layers of cells harden ... and block oil secretion. The result is an entrapment of the oils under the stratum corneum layer. This is particularly detrimental in the case of someone with acne because it also results in the entrapment of the infection.\"¹ \n\nDehydrated skin also typically responds more viciously to active ingredients, such as BHAs, AHAs, sulfur, retinoids, and vitamin C. It can also respond to completely benign ingredients, creating a burning sensation or the skin feeling flushed and hot.\n\n* * *\n\nCauses of Dehydration\n=====================\n\nThe most common culprits of dehydration of the skin is stripping cleansers, harsh soaps, and hot water, though a host of other causes can come into play for some people, including skin conditions that aggravate dry skin (again, while dehydrated skin is not the same as dry skin, dry skin is especially prone to dehydration) or create acne (which frequently causes people to \"overtreat\" the acne and strip their skin).\n\nSkin Conditions\n---------------\n\n*   Atopic dermatitis\n*   Irritant contact dermatitis\n*   Psoriasis\n*   Cutaneous lymphoma\n\nEnvironmental\n-------------\n\n*   Seasonal changes\n*   Dry air (low humidity)\n*   Flowing air (especially wind)\n*   UV radiation (tanning beds, the sun)\n*   Overwashing\n*   Age\n*   Sunburn\n*   Cigarette smoking and smoke exposure\n*   Friction (including harsh scrubbing and mechanical exfoliation tools like the Clarisonic)\n\nHeredity Disorders\n------------------\n\n*   Ichthyosis vulgaris\n*   Netherton syndrome\n\nHormonal\n--------\n\n*   Hypothyroidism\n*   Estrogen deficiency\n\nTopical\n-------\n\n*   Alcohol/isopropyl alcohol/SD alcohol/denatured alcohol\n*   Drinking alcohol\n*   Essential oils\n*   Clay masks\n*   Sodium lauryl sulfate\n*   Bar soap\n*   Astringents (particularly alcohol-based astringents)\n*   Topical medications (e.g. retinoids)\n*   Excessive AHA or BHA use\n\n* * *\n\nCaring for Dehydrated Skin\n==========================\n\nThe most important thing when solving dehydrated skin is consideration of the products you use as well as your environment. This means paying special attention to the ingredients label when shopping, being cautious about what is applied to the skin, and what your home environment is like (and potentially limiting outside exposure to harsh wind and sun). \n\nSince everything starts with your cleanser, this means picking a creamier cleanser or one with lower amounts of surfactants. I've done a whole post on cleansers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), if you'd like to read about all the various types of cleansers and how they work. The long and short of it is look for either a wipe-off cleansers, such as Albolene; an oil cleanser that emulsifies (rinses clean) in water, such as my beloved Clinique Take the Day off Balm; a creamy cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Aquanil; or a gentle sudsing cleanser, such as Paula's Choice Hydralight or CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. Avoid washing with hot water, which reduces the size of the micelles (the molecules created from surfactants, which cluster together), allowing them to penetrate deeper into the skin and strip it further. You'll also want to completely avoid bar soaps (pH is too high), micellar water (can be much more irritating), makeup wipes (same as micellar water), and harsh cleansers that make your skin feel tight after cleansing. \n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate. \n\nMoisturizers are also a cornerstone in treating dehydrated skin. Humectants are especially important. Some humectants to look for:\n\n*   **Glycerin** - A well-established humectant, it is a clear, thick liquid that is usually sticky on it's own. It is derived from combining water and fat, usually vegetable oil. It is not typically irritating, but it can be to some people in high concentrations.\n*   **Hyaluronic Acid (HA)** - A component of glycosaminoglycan, it occurs naturally in the dermis of the skin and is thought to play a very important role in skin function. It is advertised frequently as holding up to \"1000\" times it's weight in water (citation needed). When applied, \"hyaluronic acid forms a viscoelastic film in a manner similar to the way it holds water in the intercellular matrix of dermal connective tissue.\"¹ It needs application regularly to be effective, frequently breaking down in skin 24-48 hours after application (note: this is not the case with HA injections). It is best applied to damp skin, straight out of the shower.\n*   **Urea** - While it is frequently considered more of a moisturizer or keratolytic (able to break down bonds on dead skin) ingredient, urea has humectant properties and can attract and hold moisture in the SC.\n\n* * *\n\nHealing Dehydrated Skin\n=======================\n\nArmed with the proper ingredients, skin can typically bounce back within about two weeks (14 days). Once healed, skin should be maintained with ingredients and products that are beneficial to the skin's health. \n\nWhile healing dehydrated skin, it is recommended to use the most bland routine possible and avoid trying new things and any active ingredients at all. _It should go without saying that to heal dehydrated skin, you must drop the products that are creating the problem in the first place._ If you must change out one or two products that you believe were causing your dehydration, do so slowly and one at a time, starting with any cleansers and then moving on to moisturizers. \n\nPetrolatum is helpful to some people as well, but can cause problems for others. This is possibly due to it's ability to diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin in some people, which interferes with recovery. Your mileage may vary. \n\nIt is also recommended to sleep with a humidifier if you are in a particularly dry climate. You want to shoot for somewhere between 40-60% indoor humidity, as this will prevent the humectants from drawing moisture from the deeper layers of the skin, which evaporates away.\n\n* * *\n\nSources\n=======\n\n1.

    "body": "About four years ago, I wrote the currently sidebar'd post, [\"Evaluating Your Current Routine\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1x1ubd/evaluating_your_current_routine_read_me_before/). In that, I recommended things to ask yourself and consider before buying new products or changing your routine entirely.\n\nI recently began blogging, but I wanted to bring these posts to Reddit as well for people who did not want to click out of the sub. \n\nLots of this is content that has been referenced over the years on this subreddit, as well as elsewhere. However, I understand the frustration for new users stumbling in, seeing product recommendations and terminology being thrown around, as well as an enormous sidebar. It's pretty anxiety-inducing. I also see a lot of people skipping from products to products, asking what to try next. \n\nMy goals with this series is to break down *what* goes into your cleansers and how it affects your skin so you are empowered to make better choices as well as understand some of the science that gets passed around.\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down your average, general cleansers as well as oil cleansers (or the oil-cleansing method aka OCM) and micellar cleansers. Let's dive right in!\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Cleansers**\n\nCleansers work by dissolving or binding to things on the skin that aren't normally rinsed away by water, such as the waxes or oils produced by our skin.\n\nWithout getting too into the weeds, they are able to do this with surfactants  (or \"the thing that makes cleansers sudsy\"). The most common surfactants, and the ones you may have heard of are SLS and SLES (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). These ingredients work by binding to the lipids (oils such as jojoba oil or silicones like dimethicone) and then being whisked away by their water-loving properties. Once mixed with water, surfactant molecules cluster together into little spheres known as micelles. Some surfactants molecular size allows them to penetrate deeper into the skin (namely SLS), where they can bind to skin cells. As you can imagine, this is very irritating to skin, and is what causes the eventual drying that you may experience after using some products.\n\nSo by increasing the size of these molecules or adding additional ingredients, we get a gentler cleanser.\n\nIf you've hung out in any beauty circle, you've probably also heard chatter of pH - \"What is the pH of that cleanser? Have you tried the CosRx Low pH Cleanser?\". The pH value of a cleanser can have an impact on how harsh your cleanser is on your skin as well, and simply put, it's because the surface of your skin is naturally pretty acidic.\n\nGoing back to Chemistry class really quickly, you'll probably remember something called the \"pH Scale.\"\n\nThings on the left side of the scale (1-6) are considered acidic. Things on the right side (8-14) are considered basic or alkaline. And of course, there is what is considered neutral, or pH 7. Skin has a pH of around 5.5, but becomes more basic the further down into the dermis you go, reaching a pH of about 7. Why is this important, you may be asking? Well, if you think back to your high school Chemistry course, you may have remembered the good ol' baking soda and vinegar reaction. When this reaction -- called an acid-base reaction -- occurs, the baking soda and vinegar exchange atoms and form different compounds, namely water and carbon dioxide. This is because bases are compounds that generally want to donate atoms and acids are compounds that generally want to accept atoms.\n\nAs skin comes in contact with other ingredients, even water, the pH temporarily raises and other compounds are created. Fatty acids (read: acidic components) of the skin are removed.\n\nHealthy skin can usually re-balance itself within an hour or so. Some skin takes longer to do this, especially skin that is prone to irritation, such as skin with acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. This is why your boyfriend can cleanse his face with a Dial soap bar and have glowing skin an hour later, while you're busily slathering on layer after layer of moisturizer.\n\nUsing a cleanser that is closer to our skin's natural pH is the obvious solution to this problem, and most modern cleansers are formulated much better than those of the past.\n\nSo now you're probably asking yourself: *Well, how can I test the pH of the cleanser I would like to buy? And how do I know the surfactant isn't going to irritate my skin?*\n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate.\n\nYou should also look for moisturizers, like oils, ceramides, cholesterol, and humectants (water-binding ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or squalane). Avoid saponified oils (please don't use Dr. Bronner's on your skin) and bar soap.\n\nNow I know you're asking: What about oil cleansers then?\n\n---\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\nWhat if I told you that your grandmother was ahead of the game?\n\nNearly all of us have seen a tub of Pond's Cold Cream hanging out in our grandmother's bathroom or on her vanity. You might've seen her dab some all over her skin and wipe away all of her makeup with a tissue. She may have sworn by it as the thing that kept her looking young, and she's not entirely wrong.\n\nI like to think of oil cleansers as being broken down into two types of cleansers -- wipe-off cleansers like your grandmother's Pond's, and emulsifying cleansers like the translucent oil cleansers that come in a pump or tub.\n\nThe former -- wipe-off cleansers -- are the most common mixtures in the cosmetics industry. They are usually simple mixtures of oil and water, and are high in water content, which makes them inexpensive.\n\nThey spread easily and often leave an oily or richly moisturized feeling behind. They're typically purchased by people with mature skin, but are a great alternative for people with dry skin.\n\nThe latter -- emulsifying cleansers -- are also mixtures of oil and water, but are higher in oil content, which makes them more expensive. They contain emulsifiers that bind well to water, which allows them to rinse away in water.\n\nThe benefit of these cleansers is there is no real \"sudsing\" action on the skin. Indeed many of them can actually feel \"moisturizing\" due to their ingredient makeup. They are also excellent for breaking down make-up and other waterproof things, such as mascara, due to the high oil content.\n\nWhen picking out an oil-cleanser, look for shortened ingredient lists. Don't be swayed by extracts or other frills that will wash away. The oil itself will be the biggest point of irritation (or not) for your skin, so don't be afraid of \"boring\" oils like mineral oil or petrolatum, which is one of the blandest, most non-reactive molecules around.\n\nJust one more to go...\n\n---\n\n**Micellar Cleansers**\n\nMicellar water is quite literally made up of micelles, or the molecular bunches of surfactants that group up, their water-loving butts faced outwards. These larger bunches of molecules, diluted in combinations of water and hydrating ingredients (such as glycerin), are the most mild of cleansers.\n\nThe percentage of surfactant to other ingredients is generally so low that micellar water does not need to be washed away. This allows the hydrating ingredients, such as glycerin, to stay on the skin after the debris has been removed.\n\nThis makes micellar water ideal for sensitive skin or prepping the skin for product application, when cleansing with a standard cleanser and water will be too drying.\n\n---\n\n**All Wrapped Up**\n\nSo what does this all mean? Here are some general skin cleanser guidelines to follow:\n\n* **Cleanse your skin at least once a day.** At the end of the day, your skin not only has a build-up of oils, but also debris and particulates in the air.\n* **Don't pile it on.** Your non-sudsing cleanser does not need to suds to work.\n* **Two-step cleanse for removing make-up.** Most make-up is waterproof and does not easily cleanse away. Use an oil cleanser to break down the make-up and remove it.\n* **Use cottons to remove cream cleansers like Pond's.** The friction will help to remove grime and dirt. Splash with water after to remove any leftover emulsifiers.\n* **Use cool water when cleansing.** Hot water can make surfactants penetrate deeper by reducing the size of the micelles, which is why your hot shower is more irritating and drying to your skin than the less-fun cooler shower.\n* **Moisturize.** Even water strips away the valuable fatty acids in your skin. Using a moisturizer on your skin after will help your skin to re-balance itself quicker.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Kind of Stephen](https://kindofstephen.com/)\n* [DermaScope](https://www.dermascope.com/ingredients/surfactants-and-emulsifiers)\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\n🌟 **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\n🌟 **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\n🌟 **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\n🌟 **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\n🌟  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\n🌟 **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed! i'll also leave my current routine in the comments below, for those who may be interested. i hope this was of some help to y'all :-), and that all of you would have good health during this period!",

    "body": "Edits: Tried to fix some formatting issues. \n\n—\n\nHi everyone! \n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/?st=JIATDG0T&sh=d905c745), I talked at length about the skin condition of rosacea -- what it is, the subtypes, what the causes are, the foundations in treatment (cleansing and moisturizing), as well as treatments and beneficial ingredients. This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "Here are my thoughts on the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser & Kale-lalu-yaHa Exfoliant:\n\n\n**Cleanser:**\nThis cleanser doesn't have much of a scent which I love and contains some really awesome, skin loving ingredients. First, this contains matcha which is a potent antioxidant that helps protect the skin while hemp seed oil hydrates. Hemp seed oil is also high in linoleic acid and full of amino acids that heal, plump and protect the skin. Other ingredients include Vitamin B5 & Sodium PCA are skin strengthening ingredients that also help to hydrate. The cleansing agent in this formula is the coco-betaine, coco-glucoside & decyl glucoside which are a group of surfactants that are gentle at cleansing the skin without over-drying & protects the lipid barrier. I did pH test this and it tested about a 6.\n\nMy philosophy is that cleansing is one of the most important steps in any skincare routine. So, if you haven't guessed, I have tried my fair share of cleansers and I have to say, this cleanser is absolutely fantastic. This is a slightly foaming, gel cleanser that cleanses the skin thoroughly without stripping and leaves my skin incredibly soft and hydrated. It is also pretty concentrated, so you don't need to use very much. I am super impressed with the formulation and how well this works on my skin. I also love that this retails for $16 so it is extremely affordable. This has quickly replaced my former HG (holy grail) cleanser and I will keep repurchasing because it's just that good!\n\n\n\n**Kale-lalu-yaHa:**\nThis smells like a typical acid product, similar to Paula's Choice 2% BHA. This contains 5.25% glycolic acid as the exfoliating agent which is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) derived from sugar cane. AHA's are water soluble which means that they work on the surface of the skin. AHA's do not penetrate very deep into the skin and are best suited for removing dead skin cells that build up on the skin's surface. This also contains kale and other dark leafy greens which are potent antioxidants that are full of vitamins, minerals and nutrients. Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin B5, Allantoin and Aloe keep the skin hydrated and soothed. I did pH test this and it tested about a 4.5.\n\nSo the pH is around 4-4.5 which is a little high but can still exfoliate the skin. I personally think that this formula would be best suited for those with sensitive skin or those sensitive to acids. Also, this would be a great option for those just starting to get into using acids regularly. Since the pH is slightly high, this isn't going to be super strong, which I like because it doesn't cause any negative reaction on my sensitive skin. To use, I saturate a cotton pad and swipe my face, neck and upper chest and leave it on, no rinsing required. This does tingle which means it's working but dissipates quickly as it drys. Like the cleanser, this is very concentrated so a little goes a long way. After using this 3x per week for the past month, I can report that this is indeed a gentle exfoliating liquid that has kept my skin smooth, soft, a little more even toned and I have noticed by pores are less clogged. Although this isn't a BHA (an oil soluble exfoliant) that exfoliates the gunk that gets trapped inside the pores, keeping the surface clear of dead skin does help keep the pores from collecting that gunk in the first place. I hope that makes sense :) Again, this is a very gentle exfoliant and is a good intro for those new to chemical exfoliants. I would definitely repurchase!\n\nI do have a full blog post with more pictures [here](http://www.pdxbeautiful.com/2018/03/review-krave-beauty.html). ",

    "body": "**I hate buying sunscreen.** Outside of a few gel-like sunscreens which I can never find for a reasonable cost, most just disappoint me. I feel like I often have to choose between having the complexion of a sad day, or looking **so** greasy.\n\nMy skin ranges from light-medium to medium-dark. To visualize: I'm Doja Cat when it's cold out and Kerry Washington once I can get some sun - strong golden tones. I tan fast, with or without SPF (though I am very pro-SPF), and have burned exactly once in my entire lifetime. I'm still not interested in putting myself at risk for skin cancer.\n\nI'm not going to claim that this sunscreen will not leave a white cast on people with deeper and darker skin-tones than my own, though I truly hope it works for you. So... here's my review!\n\n**Banana Boat: Light as Air, 50+ SPF UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion**\n\n* **Price**: $5.99 on sale at Kroger, regularly $10.99 here.\n* **Size**: 6 oz. ($0.99/oz. on sale, regularly $1.83/oz.)\n* **Scented**? Yes, it's pretty noticeable at first but fades (not completely). I'm VERY sensitive to scents (I can't wear perfumes, they trigger migraines), but it's not the usual *Eau de Banana Boat* I expected.\n* **White cast?** None on my skin tone. Absolutely none. It's decently liquid-y for the SPF, and if you apply it more liberally, it can be rubbed in and absorbs fairly quickly.\n* **Greasy**? NOPE. It's not one of those slick sunscreens. Alcohol is the fifth sunscreen, and I'm no scientist, but I suspect this may contribute to it.\n* **Pilling**? None. I tried applying more and more to dare it to pill, it didn't! Usually, sunscreen will build up and 'highlight' my hair follicles/stubble (I have hairy arms and can't be bothered to shave regularly) - didn't happen!\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Diisopropyl Adipate, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tapioca Starch, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Coco-Glucoside, Chlorphenesin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.\n\nI read a lot of reviews on here and think \"Yeah, can't relate!\" since a lot of sunscreens with 50+ SPF have white casts, and many AB sunscreens are either intentionally white cast-y or, worse, pink-tinted, which are both a no for me. \n\nI hope this block of text helps another medium-skinned beaut who has been walking around intermittently looking like a tombstone and/or bacon grease. Feel free to ask any questions, I haven't seen much about this sunscreen before, and I've been trying it out for a while now :).",

I myself am white but obviously not enough because the white cast looks horrible, especially if I haven't shaved. And the tinted sunscreens are great, but then their too dark and it can make for some uncomfortable looks out in public. Plus, they cost more per ounce and require more care in application. But then most chemical sunscreens aren't as safe for sensitive, acne prone skin like myself. Several of the supposedly sensitive ones I saw today at Target still had oxybenzone and other irritating ingredients. But this one didn't. So yeah-thanks for the heads up. I'm hopeful about it now!",

I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

I think people are \"desensitized\" to the marketing/labeling w/r/t percentages of acids because of the Ordinary pushing their dumb MAX PERCENTAGE MINIMUM PH nonsense, but I bet this will be a nice starter acid toner, an alternative to something like the Pixi Glow Tonic with a bit MORE oomph (as the pH is lower.) I personally might try it out as an alternative to my CosRX AHA/BHA Toner (although they are not the same and the CosRX is more like the Pixi in that its more inert/less active.) I do already use a 14% glycolic product several days a week, so not sure if I want to put my money in another product that uses glycolic alone. I am excited by the yeast extract- I love everything with yeast. \n\nAlso so excited that neither product contains niacinamide, though I'm sure whatever she makes next will have it!",

Sorry the image isn't super aesthetic but I wanted to write the post asap!\n\n**About me:** 24F\n\n**Climate:** Between 35-39 degrees this summer, slightly humid but really dry most times.\n\n**Skin type:** My body's skin is dehydrated and always needs to be moisturised; however, even slightly heavy lotions make me sweat.\n\n**Texture of this lotion:** Looks like any regular lotion, bFraut when rubbed in it literally disappears into my skin in a good way. It spreads like a serum/water lotion.\n\n**Fragrance:** Light but pleasant scent, very similar to other Vaseline lotions. \n\n**Cost:** MRP 300\n\n**WRP/WNRP:** WRP\n\nIngredients list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Glutathione, Sodium Hyaluronate, Retinyl Palmitate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycine, Cystine, Sodium PCA, Petrolatum, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Perfume, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Coco-Glucoside, BHT, Benzoic Acid, Citric Acid, Potassium Hydroxide\n\n*Moisturisers I've already tried and mini reviews (note:* ***reviews are only for summers, otherwise I love all of these lotions and they work perfectly during winter***\\*):\\*\n\n* *Vaseline Aloe lotion* \\- Too light and not moisturising enough.\n* *Vaseline Restoring variant in the yellow bottle* \\- Makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Parachute Blue Bottle* \\- heavy and makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Vaseline Aloe Gel tube* \\- I really like this one for summer, gets absorbed super fast and gives a cooling feeling. However, I don't know if it helped with my dehydrated skin.\n* *Vaseline Daily Bright & Calming Body Serum -* I love this one. Though it's slightly less moisturising it's actually good for really hot and humid days.\n* I've also used the *Neutrogena hydro-boost gel* and *Cosrx All-in-one cream*s on my body because my face skin reacted badly to them - I honestly loved these for my body during summers because of how light but hydrating they are but obviously they're too expensive to be purchased to use on the body.\n* Lastly, I've tried to dilute every regular lotion with some water; *Minimalist 5% Niacinamide Lotion*, *Vaseline advanced repair* and one of the *Nivea dark blue bottle*s (all my HGs for winter). All of them still made me sweat after the water dried down.\n\nI have tried the *Vaseline Gluta-hya Serum-in-lotion* for about 1 week now and love it already!\n\nThis one looked like any other lotion but when applied, it literally turns into a watery serum consistency and gets absorbed by my skin within minutes. It doesn't feel heavy at all but moisturises very well for quite a few hours.\n\nI had to reapply on some really dry parts of my body within 4 hours but I'd take that any day over the sweaty feeling I get from using regular lotions in summer.\n\nIts scent is very similar to the Yellow Vaseline lotion however, it's slightly different and it's quite pleasant.\n\nIf anyone of you had used the Vaseline spray-on lotion/serum thing, this Gluta-hya thing is a more moisturising version of that product which is great because I also like the spray lotion despite it being slightly less moisturising.\n\nI don't know if it's really new in the market or if I've just found it but it's a good find!\n\nAlso, at the back of the tube, it says that this specific variant has *'Dual UV Filters'* i.e. UVA and UVB filters but obviously, I doubt if it's good enough protection, so I won't stop using my body sunscreen yet.\n\nThey also have another variant called [Dewy Radiance Serum-in-Lotion](https://www.myntra.com/body-lotion/vaseline/vaseline-non-sticky-gluta-hya-dewy-radiance-serum-in-lotion---200-ml/22580648/buy?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi46iBhDyARIsAE3nVrZg5uLe88lcJQxcHA5kivV2zWTXKHmiQ3ZT1v1Twhhmqj53tFr9twIaAu3lEALw_wcB) if anyone's interested!\n\nApologies if my format/writing isn't that great!",

I’ve been rotating this with my VaniCream Cleanser and I just want to be done with that so I can keep using this!\n\n**Name:** Pipette Baby Wash + Shampoo, Fragrance Free (https://pipettebaby.com/collections/bathing/products/shampoo-wash?variant=29620520616022)\n\n**Price:** $6-10 available in so many stores like Target, Ulta, Bed Bath & Beyond, Amazon, etc\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycerin, Coco-Glucoside, Glycolipids, Squalane, Citric Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Sodium Gluconate\n\n**What I Like About It:**\n- Large size: 11.8 fl. oz\n- Super affordable. When I bought mine, I got it for around $5. That turns out to be 43 cents per fl. oz\n- Easily available in so many stores. There’s always a store that has it on sale so it’s easy to pick it up for $6-7.\n- Simple, non-stripping ingredients that keeps the face hydrated, but is still able to remove sunscreen and make up. Sometimes, I don’t even bother double cleansing if my make up and sunscreen aren’t too resistant.\n- Cruelty free and vegan\n\nI honestly don’t have anything bad to say about this product. I was hesitant to make this review because I wanted to keep it on the DL haha! But, it’s so good! I’m glad I tried it based on a recommendation here. Never going back to regular cleansers. If it doesn’t work for you, you’re not out much at all.",

    "body": "I've been lurking a while and have commented once or twice already, so this is a little introduction. Sadly I won’t have time I think to build a proper reddit presence, but it’s just rude to stomp in now and then with questions and never interact properly, so … an introduction is a half-arsed excuse for my rudeness. Also it’s an opportunity to warn you all that I don't really understand reddit at all? What happened to plain aul forums? I'll probably make a tonne of mistakes. \n\nI live in Sweden, am 40, and have always, always, always had bad skin. So I thought. Until I hit say 35 and got REALLY bad skin. (This summer I was looking at my wedding photos from 20 years ago and bloody hell I was gorgeous. However, I thought I was ugly, of course. Let this be a lesson to you youngsters. Waste not your time feeling ugly! Not worth it.) Now, I have cystic, probably hormonal, and partly stress-induced, acne along my jawline and down my neck. The rest of my body has always been acne free, incidentally. Because life, eh.\n\nApart from the acne I'm an aging, wrinkled mess, lol. (Not lol.) Sun damage, check. Wrinkles, check. Loss of elasticity, check. Enlarged pores, check. Looking like my granny, check. I've never really fussed much with my skin apart from trying to kill acne, which I realise now is a common story. Everything else was pointless because ACNE. You know? I got interested in skincare as a concept that might work maybe max two years ago when I discovered Caroline Hirons's blog, and thus double cleansing. Imagine how little teen acne I'd have had if I'd known about double cleansing... I realized then that those expensive creams, acne meds or whatever never had a chance of working if my skin wasn’t clean. Using recommendations via Hirons gave me some improved texture, but I stalled fast. I found this reddit via looking for reviews for Missha’s Signature Real Complete BB Cream. Found Fifty Shades of Snail, and here I am! Stalking you lot. So far I'm liking the low ph approach, which seems to make a difference and explains why Hirons only got me so far. She's got no real science, bless her. \n\nWell, basically, Fiddy made me do it, and I've purchased and tried a fair few things already with blatant disregard of our very different skin types, lol. One major problem for me in all this skincare business is that I don't love doing it. I want to be a soap and water and a slap of face cream person. I'd love to just have a bottle of almond oil and use that for everything and be gorgeous. HA. And the AB thing of patting in layers of stuff for hours? Jesus it stresses me OUT. It takes so looooooong. Convince me that the patting is important, I just feel like a twit of the highest order. Also I’m so unaware. “Look at your skin and determine what it needs today” – what does that meeeaaaannnnn. My skin needs *less acne*, that’s what my skin needs. I can’t connect what I see in the mirror to picking something to put on it. I’ve copped on that it’s often dehydrated though, so I’m trying to think moisture, not just oil. (Snow White and the Asian Pear made me do that. :) )\n\nThere are, as far as I’ve ascertained (side note: ascertained is such a delicious word, isn’t it? I just love saying it) two online shops in Sweden with any sort of AB. Bonnybonny sells The Face Shop, Missha and It’s Skin. Online chemist Apotea sells some Whamisa. That’s it folks. I’ve purchased from Cosmetic Love to try out the things Fiddy made me try (goddammit Fiddy), and as far as I’m concerned CL is MY bae because free shipping makes my life easy. However, rubbish free samples so far, Etude House BB creams that are all streaky and crap and TonyMoly whitening panda cream which is … what. Why you even exist, panda cream. Anyway. Bonnybonny is a very good shop, super friendly, fast and with the personal touch. I got free samples from them (when I bought my BB cream) of the It’s Skin Power 10 Effectors, YE and CO. YE quite nice? Felt like it did something? CO a joke. Considering the LI one based on stuff  read here on the subreddit? Really unsure. It’s just much easier to buy in-country also I like to support local shops. Generally though, for skincare,  I’m not feeling the brands available in Bonnybonny. They feel a bit blah, meh, cheap? My first sheet mask experience was Missha masks from Bonnybonny and I was unimpressed. I have now bought many more ;) (GODDAMMIT FIDDY) and begin to see the point. However – the environment, folks. I don’t like this single-use business at all – and if the sheet mask is a bit shit I feel as though I’ve single-handedly killed a small herd of whales or something. The whole consumist slant to AB or any skincare addiction really frustrates me. Do I need the sheet masks, or can I buy equally good serums/essences whatever instead? File under Banivani’s queries and expect me to pop up with ponderings about this. \n\nI’ve got a low-ph cleansing thing going on, using oil to loosen makeup (atm mineral oil because trying it out because reddit), then a Western style cleansing lotion from the chemist, a Swedish brand called Elw. Ph 5,5 and no fragrance. (I quite like the Hirons approach of cleaning with a flannel you see. But you can try to convince me I’m wrong. I might listen because I’m still not beautiful.)  I also have \"soap\" called Lactacyd, also a Swedish brand. It's made with lactic acid and has a ph of 3,5. It's been around forever and is marketed towards sensitive skin/areas (i.e. vaginas, my friends). I actually bought the very vagina-specific one (“for intimate areas”, what) to try out as a foaming cleanser, because it didn’t have SLS as second ingredient (ingredients are Aqua, Lauryl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lactic Acid, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Sodium Methylparaben for those interested). I am still not beautiful. After this we start getting to the AB! In lieu of the acids recommended by Hirons I’ve got Cosrx BHA and AHA, and the A-Sol thingie. It’s all grand, but I’m not beautiful. Not sure the AHA does much. I think propolis might be good for me though, quite liking the A-Sol and have re-purchased. Am considering something more propolosy than the a-sol as a next step? Because after my “acids” and A-Sol I don’t really have anything. Am finishing up a few Western-style serums and have some sheet masks, that’s it, oh! and a bottle of Cosrx snail essence that will have arrived today (my daughter is picking the package up for me :) ). \n\nSo I’ll be lurking about looking for things to layer. I want things that address my wrinkles, pores and dehydration, also, you know, FECKING ACNE. I’ll be nosing around your moisturizer threads and your emulsion threads. I’m not at all sure what I want/need out of those though, this is a tricky step for me. \n\nSorry for the essay! Oh, and dewy – what’s up with that? What does it meeeaaann? Basically “shiny with class”? Or does it mean “wet”? If you take a stroll through the dewy grass you end up with wet feet, like. I’ll be back. \n\n",

        "body": "Hej there, my western neighbour! Finn here with one year and some months of AB under my belt. \n\nHonestly, the knowlegde of \"what my skin needs today\" increases the better your skin gets and overall is bit less of a thing for oilier skin than drier skins IMO. \n\nAlso, I don't pat in for long unless it's actually needed for a reason. As in, I pat my morning routine more so I can apply sunscreen/makeup on top quicker and not have the moistness interfere. Evening, I just mostly spread and leave, or pat just enough to know I've reached all areas of face. In the end my face is quite moist of all my products, but I just seal it all in with a cream or sleeping pack and go to bed. I don't fall asleep immediately, so the stuff has about 30min to absorb so it won't rub off on my pillow, and the last steps keep it from running off my face and make it absrob quicker. \n\nHave you actually had derm prescription/diagnose lately? I know for a fact I could not keep my skin in this pretty condion had it not been for my double Roaccutan ten-thirteen years ago and my IUD this year. After these steps to rein in my hormones, AB has the freedom to do all its topical stuff. \n\nAnd I'd definitely encourage you to try a gentle propolis essence in addition to A-Sol. Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis Essence is really good and somewhat easy to find even if prices are a bit higher. Pureheal's and Tosowoong are other brands that have similar products.\n\nIf you liked Cosmetic-Love (I do too, I think I buy from them most often) you'll like Jolse and BeautynetKorea too. RRS I go to whenever I want cheap sheet masks, but they have shipping costs so it needs a bit more research and comparison. Otherwise, Ebay.\n\nAs far as sheet masks go, they are more of a pamper/boost/before important events thing. Get an essence for everyday, but if you find a brand/flavour of a sheet mask that gives you a good effect, stock up a 10-pack or two of it. I always get two uses off a single sheet mask packet, which makes me feel a bit better about them, Frst the mask and then next day the leftover essence after my usual essences. I got binder clips for the sole reason of sealing the sheet mask packets overnight :P\n\nOh, and dewiness. Means shiny in a luminous/a bit wet sort of way. [This](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/29/70/7d/29707d66e5ad0f14e44156fe3c8a13c5.jpg) picture is a good example. Because healthy skin is shiny, and moistness is pretty, Korean trend (although it's fading a bit, it seems to be cottony skin now that's in) has been \"as glossy as you can make it\". I mean, it's mostly achived with a lot of shiny balms and highlighter as far as makeup goes, but if you have hydrating enough skincare you should have somewhat shiny skin even with no makeup and just sunscreen over your skincare steps.\n\nAnyway, do search me in the Routine Megathread to see my recent-ish products.

I believe that once your acne is under control then you could better address your other skin issues like wrinkles, pores, and sun damage. Adult acne is usually characterized by papules, pustules and deep nodules and regular skincare products may not be enough for that. Just like what /u/pohybel asked, are you seeing a dermatologist? Perhaps some prescription medication like antibiotics and retinoids could help clear your skin. \n\nAnd I agree, the layers of AB (and the waiting times) can seem stressful and demotivating. But the good thing about AB is you can add or subtract from the routine. You can customize it however you want. If you're not so much into sheet masks, it's fine! Even a basic routine will do if it's able to address your skin's needs. :)\n\nI'm excited to read the responses to your post. I'm sure this will be a great and fruitful discussion. :)",

When you're ready to fight the battle against aging, let me know.

I go weeks without sheet masking, and then I might do a couple in a week when I'm feeling like it. It certainly doesn't have to be an every day thing. If you want to, you could replace with wash off masks, or sleeping masks or...gasp...nothing at all.\n\nAlso, you really don't have to use Asian brands. To my way of thinking, AB is in large part about the mentality and the routine. Double cleansing is freakin' awesome. Using a cleanser that doesn't make your face feel tight and dry has been a real game changer for me. Lots of layers of slippy hydrators and serums is, frankly, lovely. GOOD SUNSCREEN is a godsend. Maybe you don't care about sunscreen as you're in Sweden and it's going into winter. But in the summer months it would be good even for you. You could buy locally for basically all of those things - it used to be that you just couldn't find an oil cleanser from a western brand, for example, but they're catching on and now you can. However, having said that, I recently decided I was tired of ordering from Korea and did a thought experiment of trying to replace my products with only those I could buy locally and I just ended up frustrated at the ridiculously high cost of western serums. I mean, WHYYYY do they have to be so expensive? Also, mineral oil seemed to be in everything and I personally avoid it. So I'm going to try out a couple of things but...eh....gimme some Innisfree any day.\n\nOK, so, hydration. Try out something with hyaluronic acid. My personal favorite has been Hada Labo Gokujyun Alpha Lotion. This is the one in the red bottle that has some anti-aging stuff included (good for us over-40's types!). But I may try the new Gokujyun Premium lotion when I can get my hands on it just to compare. Don't want to try getting hold of that? What about Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel or Indeed Labs Hydraluron serum? I have no real idea if they are comparable but they are hyaluronic acid focused gels and aim to do that nice light hydration thing.\n\nAnyway, stick around. Post some, even if you don't feel you have time, because we all seem to like reading your writing style!\n\nEDIT: PS I don't pat anything in. Can't get the hang of it, and it makes my face feel sticky. So, um, I just smooth things on and let them sink in a bit, and that's it.",

        "body": "What u/pohybel said, but also in addition, if you have been battling acne for many years, and more so now, it is really best to see a dermatologist for that, as adult acne and cystic acne is tough as shit to battle using only otc products - it can require a long ass time to adjust and readjust until finding the right set of products that might possibly help, which if you're older you're really not going to be able to afford spending that much time to only potentially find a solution for the acne. So I strongly advise going to the derm first before spending any more money on acne specific products or actives (which I don't usually advise people to use until they have at least a basic routine (cleanse, hydration,moisturize, sunscreen) that already works for their skin) to better figure out what you're dealing with and how you can deal with the acne first. Once you have the acne more or less under control - during which time it is strongly advised to follow what the derm says (make sure you like and trust your derm, can always go for a second opinion first if you're unsure about them) and keep only a basic routine as well while you're on their course of treatment, , then you can concentrate more on the anti aging portion of things and fiddle with a routine (that doesn't have to be super complicated). Be sure to ask the derm about using Lactacyd for cleansing (well, and disclose your routine as it is as well. Be as honest with the derm as possible about your skin so they have a better idea of how to combat your acne) because that is pretty unorthodox and Idk if that is good for your skin or not.\n\nIf you're not using sunscreen, I strongly advise not using actives, really (and also, please use sunscreen. It is the number one sure thing that will help in reducing additional sun damage to your skin from here on out). Most actives make your skin more photosensitive which would only escalate your wrinkle issues if you don't use sunscreen daily.",

    "body": "They released an article a few weeks ago about farm-to-face beauty products. My feelings about the movement towards \"natural\" aside, the writer recommended a $60 cleansing oil, and included this following line:\n\n> [It's paraben-, preservative- and chemical-free, and smells divine.] (https://www.refinery29.com/2018/01/189611/natural-ethical-beauty-products-farm-to-face#slide-1) \n\nI am taking offense at the preservative-free claim. This is not only factually wrong, this is extremely dangerous.\n\nLet me make this clear: the marketing copy for this product doesn't claim to be preservative-free. The copy brags about having AHA and plant extracts, but they don't claim to be [preservative-free] (https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/african-botanics-pure-marula-cleansing-oil.html). If the company did, they would have been wrong. \n\nThis is the ingredient list: \n\n>Glycerin, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Aqua, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Sorbitan Oleate, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Moringa Pterygosperma (Moringa) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Isoamyl Laurate, Lauryl Glucoside, Coco Glucoside, Eriocephalus punctulatus (Chamomile Cape) Essential Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit) Essential Oil, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccahrinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Extract, Tocopherol Acetate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate\\*, Citral\\*, Citronellal\\*, Geraniol\\*, Limonene\\*, Linalool\\*. \\*Constituents Of Natural Essential Oils Used. \\*\\*Certified Organic. 100% Vegan. Gluten-free.\n\nGuess what? Both dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol are used as preservatives. So the writer's claim about preservative-free is factually wrong.\n\nHere's the bigger issue, though: cosmetic products need preservative systems. \n\nYou cannot sell an unsafe product. Cosmetics are often a mixture of oils and water, which is perfect breeding ground for disease agents like mold and bacteria and viruses and fungi. This means that you cannot sell a product without an adequate preservative system. These germs need to be killed, or you will sicken someone, if not kill them. \n\nEven if you did your best to disinfect the manufacturing equipment, and even if all of the employees involved in manufacture practice safe manufactory practices, bacteria and mold can still get in. Plus, as a consumer uses the product, it will accumulate bacteria, fungi and mold over time. If these are allowed to grow unimpeded, this can change the color, scent, texture, etc of the product. Consumers like having a product that lasts as long as possible. As such, it is very important to have a system in place to preserve the product, not only to preserve human health, but to keep a product usable for as long as possible. \n\nTherefore, suggesting that a product 100% lacks preservatives, and implying that this is a good thing, is extremely irresponsible. By suggesting that having no system in place is more ethical, natural, or safe, you are endangering people's lives. Additionally, you are forcing your readers to spend more money on products than they need to, simply because preservative systems are necessary for it to last long enough for it to be used up. \n\n(I will note that there are products that claim to be self-preserving; these products don't use traditional preservatives, but they still have a system in place. Whether these are adequate is outside the scope of this post, but even the natural cosmetic lines agree that preserving products is a good thing.)\n\nAlso, the chemical-free line is just wrong. All matter is chemical. Oil is a chemical, extracts are chemicals, water is a chemical... ",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

I was using it consistently but despite taking oral antifungals and finally getting to the point where my products were all fungal acne safe and I wasn't mixing lipids with amino acids, I was still breaking out. \n\nTurns out, coco-glucoside, one of the ingredients in the cleanser is derived from coconut oils. Perhaps I don't understand the science, but why is this listed as fungal acne safe if this is the case? Anyway, I cut it out and switched to Bioderma Micellar Water and low and behold, my breakouts are clearing! Hopefully this helps someone if you are in the same situation as me. ",

        "body": "This is really interesting! Coco-glucoside is not usually flagged but it does contain traces of fatty alcohols that can exacerbate fungal acne, especially if it is not filtrated correctly. We are going extremely technical but, usually fatty acids or fatty alcohol with a carbon chain between 12-24 are known to be fungal acne trigger. This is because Malassezia, the yeast that cause fungal acne, can break them down and use them as a food source. This aid the yeast to increase its number and proliferate. Coco-glucoside have a carbon chain of 18. Individual with high sensibility to fungal acne triggers will have a hard time treating their breakouts because, although you are targeting the yeast with antifungals, you are still feeding the leftover yeast. In some cases, this can help the yeast create immunity to some antifungal treatments make it harder to treat.",

Putting down all the reviews at one place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21mqpuxa4p7c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6152cd7496bcfdc6354819d50cab1872dd769b28\n\n**About me**: 25 F; I have combination skin with an oily T zone in summers and dry cheeks and nose in winters. I don't like strong fragrance in products, and I stay away from DIYs\n\n**Skin concerns**: Cystic acne; scars, hyperpigmentation *and* *crying* from the cystic acne\n\nAccording to the brand, All CeraVe products are formulated to be fragrance-free.\n\n*Category 1: Cleansers*\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser**\n\nTexture: Just like its described. It’s a creamy lotion texture out of the bottle. When you add water to it, it foams up and washes off like any other foaming cleanser. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I use it two ways. First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**. Already on 6th bottle. **WRP Forever**.\n\nIngredients AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PCA, PPG-5-CETETH-20, PEG-100 STEARATE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE, ASPARTIC ACID, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, CARBOMER, GLYCOL DISTEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, GLYCINE, TRIDECETH-6, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, THREONINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, ARGININE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SERINE, SODIUM BENZOATE, VALINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, PROLINE, ISOLEUCINE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALANINE, PHENYLALANINE, COCONUT ACID, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, HYDROXYETHYL UREA, CITRIC ACID, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, HISTIDINE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, POLYQUATERNIUM-53, POLYQUATERNIUM-39, POLYSORBATE 60, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n**CeraVe** **Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser (4% Benzyl Peroxide)**\n\nTexture: Translucent lotion-y texture, It’s runnier than the Cream to foam cleanser. Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**. I cut one point for the packaging; It leaked on a flight once. **WRP**\n\nIngredients BENZOYL PEROXIDE 4%\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, SODIUM C14-16 OLEFIN SULFONATE, XANTHAN GUM, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCOLIC ACID, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PROPANEDIOL, CITRIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DIETHYLHEXYL SODIUM SULFOSUCCINATE, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n*Category 2: Serum*\n\n**CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\nTexture: Off-white runny lotion texture. Spreads easily. Not sticky, layers well under other products in my routine. No added fragrance.\n\nApplication: I started with using it twice a week and built up to every day. I use the sandwich method and layer between essence and a moisturizer. I don’t like it. It didn’t do anything for me. I noticed no difference in my skin except a slight smoothing effect. I find it to be a non-offensive beginner retinol.\n\n**5/10**. Excellent packaging. All Retinol products should come in a pump like this. **WNRP**\n\nIngredients: AQUA/WATER/EAU, PROPANEDIOL, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NIACINAMIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, DIMETHICONOL, LECITHIN, SODIUM CITRATE, RETINOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALCOHOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n*Category 3: Moisturizers*\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion**\n\nTexture: Super light gel cream texture. Applies like a dream on my skin. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I apply it after Hada Labo lotion. Used it throughout summer, great stand alone moisturizer. It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes.

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

Ik heb álles geprobeerd wat ik kon vinden en heb mij laten testen bij de dermatoloog. Ik ben mij nu al ruim een maand lang beu aan het zoeken en ik kan simpelweg geen goede verzorgingsproducten zonder dit vinden! Ik krijg zeeën van onzin als ik probeer te zoeken naar producten zonder kokosschuimmiddelen. En het helpt ook niet dat veel websites gewoonweg geen ingrediënten neerzetten voor hun producten. Dus ik vroeg mij af of er hier iemand is die wél wat middeltjes kent.\n\nIk ben op zoek naar:\n\n* Vloeibare handzeep (het liefst mild i.v.m. eczeem)\n* Zeep voor huid onder de douche\n* Shampoo (haartype is droog, fijn, golvend, lage porositeit, niet geverfd of gebleekt)\n* Conditioners\n\nTandpasta heb ik godzijdank wel kunnen vinden (lang leve Oral-B!) Zeepblokken werken goed totdat ik deze ergens naartoe moet nemen waar kokosschuimmiddelen gebruikt worden. Dan breekt de eczeem op mijn handen weer los ivm kruisbesmetting, zelfs door kleine hoeveelheden restanten in de omgeving. En om nou iedereen die ik ken te vragen om over te stappen naar producten waar ík allergisch voor ben, vind ik nogal ver gaan.\n\nAlle hulp wordt zeer gewaardeerd!\n\nWat bekende kokosschuimmiddelen zijn:\n\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine (a.k.a.

I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

Following the original poster's great idea I looked everywhere for any ingredients that could be coconut derived and included as many as the page let me. It's not perfect and 100% accurate as we know some of the ingredients can be coming form other sources, not only coconut oil, and glycerine is not on the list as the page can't specify and distinguish coconut derived one. But you're free to modify the ingredient list to your liking.

Remember there's only so many the page can handle and that's what I had there, so there might be little to no more room left, you'll get an error if you input too many.\n\nAlso, what's actually most helpful, you can input the key word in the first search bar like 'conditiner', 'moisturiser', 'shapoo', 'soap bar', 'spf' etc. And you'll get a list of desired products that are, due to list of undesired ingredients already there, coconut derivatives free.\n\nHope this helps someone out there.",

This cream and cleanser were the only additions to my routine. I stopped the cream for a while, and continued using the cleanser and my usual routine. However, every time I would use the cream it would aggravate and break me out. But, it worked WONDERS on dry patches on my feet and elbow. So I think this would be good for very very dry skin. But it felt way too heavy for my oily/normal skin. ***WNRP***.",

    "body": "Skin type: Oily, acne-prone  tho years of skincare I think my skin is now normal to oily (esp in t-zone).\n\nI already have a solid routine from my trial and error journey but I can't help myself to try new things out. After all, skincare for me is therapeutic and I don't wanna get bored doing it.\n\n**TL;DR** I love the Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer.  Oxecure cleanser irritated my skin. I still love Human Heart Nature Nourishing  Cleanser.\n\n**Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer***Ingredients:*  Water,  Glycerin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C15-19 Alkane,  Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/vp Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polydecene,  Propanediol, Glyceryl Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-100 Stearate,  Squalane, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin,  Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA,  Panthenol, Alpha-glucan Oligosaccharide, Potassium Hydroxide,  Maltodextrin, Polymnia Sonchifolia Root Juice, Ceteareth-25, Propylene  Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cetyl Alcohol, BHT,  Lactobacillus, Pantolactone, Behenic Acid, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol,  Ceramide NS, Ethylhexylglycerin, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract,  Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS, Caprooyl Phytosphingosine,  Caprooyl Sphingosine, Ascrobyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Oleate,  Lecithin, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Calendula  Officinalis Flower Extract, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hypericum Perforatum  Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Tilia Cordata Flower Extract\n\n*Notable ingredients:* 5 types of ceramides - Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS paired with Cholesterol and fatty acids - Caprooyl Phytosphingosine & Caprooyl Sphingosine to mimic skin's barrier function.\n\nAlso has glycerin, panthenol, pantolactone, lactobacillus, squalane, and aloe extract.\n\nFor reference I've tried the well-loved **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** which unfortunately broke me out. I also hate its texture and how it sits on top of my skin. Then there's the **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel** which gave me a more pleasant experience than the cream. I have gone three bottles of it already. So yea, I loved it but I also found it boring. Like it's just your regular moisturizer - *Oh no, OP discovered how moisturizer works.*\n\nAnd oxecure moisturizer came into the picture. From the list of ingredients above it is way moooore extensive than the ceramide gel so I was afraid it would break me out. Fortunately, it didn't. In fact, I like it better than the ceramide gel! It is lightweight but you'll know you have applied it unlike with the gel which absorbs completely with my skin. Nevertheless, I still like it for that coz I feel like the previous products I have applied are sealed. It also doesn't pill with my sunscreen. One drawback - it is expensive. 700 pesos for 75 ml.\n\nAlso soothes my skin when it is irritated especially when the horror of using the Oxecure cleanser happened.\n\n**Oxecure ph 5.5 Gentle Cleanser***Ingredients:*  Water,  Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine,  Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate,  Cocamide MEA, Citric Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Potassium  Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Ethylhexylglycerin,  Ceramide 3, Garcinia Mangostana (Mangosteen) Peel Extract, Centella  Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Sctutellaria  Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root  Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Aloe  Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\nSurfactants: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (CAPB), Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids\n\nFrom the first week of using it, I really liked it. It didn't dry my skin out. However, days after my skin started to turn red and patchy whenever I used it. I don't know which ingredient/s sensitized my skin. I'm pretty sure not the SLES and CAPB as they are present to Celeteque cleanser (which I liked). And considering it has lot of hydrating and moisturizing ingredients, kinda bummer this turned out to be a holy fail for me. My body enjoys it now tho. Still, for me it is worth trying coz who knows it might work perfectly for you.\n\nA hunt for a cleanser started. I was using Celeteque Hydration Cleanser for years already. I didn't have any problems with it except that sometimes I feel like it kinda dries my skin especially when my skin is retinizing from tretinoin use. Still I should've stuck with *if ain't broke, don't fix it* mantra.\n\nSo one day I was at Watsons, just the usual window shopping of products. And I stumbled upon Human Heart Nature products and saw the **nourishing** variant cleanser. It brought back memories when I was just starting with skincare. When I was hopeless and felt like every products I used were not helping with my skin concerns, that cleanser gave me hope. I experienced the real definition of gentle cleansing after trying harsh scrubs and whatnot on my face.\n\n*Ingredients:*  water, decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, glycerin, Solanum lycopersicum  (tomato) fruit extract, carrageenan, tocopherol, sodium lactate, sodium gluconate, dicaprylyl ether, glyceryl oleate, hydrogenated palm  glycerides citrate, parfum, levulinic acid, sodium levulinate, phytic  acid, p-anisic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid\n\n*Surfuctants:* decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside - derived from coconut so be warry if you're sensitive to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward I bought a bottle of it. I used it for a week before giving my verdict. And now I can say that it is still the gentlest cleanser I have ever used. My skin feels supple whenever I use it. Although it has now a different packaging from what I can remember, it's still my first love. That feeling when everything feels right.\n\n*Hoy vevs iba na 'yan.*",

    "body": "This past summer, I managed clear through a lot of the excess products I had on hand - yay me! I really wanted to make an effort to minimize my skin care routine in general, but also try to make better choices when it comes to choosing brands and products. Saying that, I am all about affordable skin care and love me some drug store products and definitely do not judge those for choosing whatever brands they choose - if it works, you do you. \n\nFrom the title of this post, you can see I had some hefty requirements for a new cleanser... but about 2 weeks ago, I stumbled upon [this](https://cocoonapothecary.ca/products/cleanse-tea-tree-aloe) unassuming product at The Big Carrot Market (in Toronto); Cocoon Apothecary's Tea Tree & Aloe Facial Cleanser. Cocoon Apothecary is a brand based out of Kitchener, Ontario and have been around since 2003. They're definitely all about the \"all-natural\" route, which I honestly could care less about - I love me some safe and effective chemicals. Despite that, I thought I would give the product a chance; I loved that it only had 10 ingredients, had glass packaging and was a gel cleanser. For some reason, all the Canadian skin care brands seem to insist on doing oil-cleansers only. I also thought the price was fairly reasonable - it was $22 at The Big Carrot for 250 ml. \n\nAfter two weeks of using it, I can honestly say I don't think I'll go back to another cleanser. Background on myself; normal/combination skin (oilier in the summer, drier in the winter), occasional small break-outs, and somewhat prone to redness. The foaming agent used in this cleanser is coco-glucoside. I can use one pump and get a really good lather going. There are two essential oils in this (tea tree and lavender); I've used both on my skin before and never had any reactions. They're also they very last two ingredients on the list, so I'm sure it's less than 1% concentration. \n\nOverall, I feel like the cleanser actually cleanser actually cleans my skin very well. I don't wear any make up, only sunscreen (so can't speak to it's ability to remove make up). After cleansing my skin feels very soft, smooth, but not tight at all. The pH of the cleanser is listed as 5 on their website, which is perfect to me. I don't use it around my eye area, but I could see it stinging there because of the EO's. And I really appreciate that Cocoon Apothecary is making efforts to be a truly sustainable and eco-friendly company. I don't think Canadian skin care brands get enough credit, so any chance I have to support one (that have effective products), I'm 110% down. \n\nAll in all - if you're looking for a gentle, foaming cleanser that fits into all the categories that I mentioned in the title, definitely give Cocoon Apothecary's Tea Tree + Aloe cleanser a chance. Even from a price point, I think it's pretty reasonable. Now on the hunt for CF, vegan, eco-friendly, Canadian moisturizer and sunscreen :)",

It's very hydrating and soothing, which is a bit unusual for a zinc sunscreen.\n\n**Filters & SPF:** 22.4% Non-Nano Zinc Oxide SPF 32\n\n**Full (inactive) Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coconut Alkanes, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\\*, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Coco-Glucoside, Lactobacillus Ferment, Rubus Idaeus (Red Raspberry) Seed Oil\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Liquid Endosperm, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Rhizomes Oil\\*, Butyrospermum Parkii Nut Extract, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Tocopherol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Isostearic Acid, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sclerotium Gum, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Octyldodecanol, Tapioca Starch, Citric Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, May contain +/- Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492)\n\n**Ingredient Callouts:** Silicone Free, Alcohol-free (contains fatty alcohols), fragrance free (does use Vanilla Planiforia Fruit Extract for scent), Vegan, Cruelty-Free, Reef-Safe (but not waterproof)\n\n**Price & Where to buy:** $25 USD for 50g, Online, direct from Kinship\n\n**About my skin/climate:** I'm 23 and have Rosacea (both generalized Erythema and papules) with very dry skin. I live in a sunny but not warm climate with a fair amount of humidity. I have extremely sensitive skin and can only tolerate mineral filters. Fitzpatrick III (but pale because Rosacea). \n\n**What it looks like on:** [**https://imgur.com/a/l2abDtE**](https://imgur.com/a/l2abDtE)\n\nIt's very hydrating and gives a nice dewy finish. This gives a mild blurring effect and does help disguise my redness. It has a slight shimmer to it, but it's not glittery. The tint is fair, and cool/pink toned. When you initially rub it in, it has a white cast but it settles to match my skin fairly well. If you're darker, the color of the tint and the white cast from a high % Zinc may become a problem. Even on me, I do get some flashback with this one. I would say it's better than most high Zinc non-nano sunscreens. \n\n**Texture/Smell**\n\nThis is a thick, creamy base. It takes a while to dry down and can remain a bit sticky to the touch. I don't find that it transfers, but my hair does occasionally get stuck in it when it's fresh. You do have to rub this is, with the thick consistency it's not one that you can just spread and leave (without looking like a ghost). It doesn't feel too heavy on the skin. \n\nAs far as smell goes, it's actually quite unusual. This one smells completely like Vanilla Cupcakes (though it dissipates fast). I was initially super skeptical of this because I don't like scented products, but I haven't had any irritation from the Vanillin from which the scent derives. I'm generally very, very sensitive to fragrances and it looks like research has it as generally non-irritating, but as always YMMV with these sort of plant extracts. \n\n**Packaging:** Sort of standard tube with plastic twist-off lid. I wish they sold it in larger quantities. It is made of 30% post-consumer materials and they have a recycling program if that's important to you. \n\n**Overall**\n\nThis is a staple of my rotation and one I'm likely to repurchase because of how hydrating and soothing it is and the high zinc percentage. It does have a lot of plant extracts, which could be irritating if you're sensitive to them (always patch-test). On me there's very minimal white-cast and I really like the finish. I think this would be best on dry to normal skin because of how hydrating the product is. I've had no issues with the sun protection (haven't gotten any burns, noticeable new sun-spots, or Rosacea flairs while wearing this). I'd like to see a higher SPF, but honestly there are limits when it comes to an all-mineral formula. It's not waterproof, but doesn't move around a lot if I sweat. \n\n**Other Zinc sunscreens I've reviewed:** [Versed Guards Up Daily Mineral Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/gpzvwy/review_sun_care_versed_guards_up_daily_mineral/)",

I can't use any of the US chemical filters and use others sparingly. I hate the smothering feeling of a lot of sunscreens and have had a lot of trouble finding ones that I tolerate. My skin is also so dry that zinc can be problematic because it's often drying/matte. I'm currently using: Kinship Self-Reflect Probiotic Sunscreen and Biossance Squalane + Zinc. I've tried (and hated) a bunch: Avene SPF 50 Mineral Suncreen, Cerave SPF 50 and SPF 30 mineral suncreens, Blue Lizard, Green Goddess etc. \n\n**Sunscreen Filters:** Zinc Oxide (15.2%)\n\n**Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide, Water/Aqua/Eau, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Diheptyl Succinate, C18-21 Alkane, Erythritol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Propanediol, Arachidyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, Coco-Glucoside, Ethyl Ferulate, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Xanthan Gum, Octyldodecyl Oleate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Sodium Hyaluronate, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Maltodextrin, Moringa Oleifera Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492).\n\n**Ingredient Callouts:**  Fragrance free, silicone free, paraben-free, alcohol-free, should be fungal-acne safe (edit: not FA safe :( )\n\nThis is an all-mineral, zinc-oxide only sunscreen. It's tinted with warm undertones, but doesn't seem to provide any sort of coverage. The color on my hand is notably different than my skintone (much warmer, less red) but it blends in very well. I don't get a white cast with this (but I am pale-ish). It doesn't cover any of my redness or give an airbrushed look like some tinted sunscreens do.\n\nTexturally, this feels somewhat like a gel moisturizer. It's silicone free so it feels fairly light on the skin once it's on. I hate the suffocating feeling of some of the high-silicone mineral sunscreens out there. The spread on this is impressive and I don't have a problem using the recommended amount and getting it to look nice. The finish is dewy/natural. It's definitely shiny at first, but tones down to look natural/hydrated. I don't find that it settles into any creases or leaves my skin too dry at the end of the day. This might move around on you if you have oily skin. I haven't had any skin irritation from using it for the past week, but will update this if I get any.\n\nThe packing of this is a tube with a twist off lid. It's pretty easy to use and made of mostly post-consumer material, which is cool. I have no complaints with the packaging other than wishing that the product was sold in a larger size (this won't last long). \n\nOne negative: the smell is sort of chemically/gross. It doesn't smell like sunscreen per say, but there's a sort of irony, weird smell to it when you first put it on. It does dissipate pretty quickly, but if you're scent-sensitive it's something to keep in mind. There's no fragrance in it at all.\n\nIn terms of sun protection: I'd rather see a higher SPF, but this performs adequately for me when I go for walks. I haven't had any burning or increases in hyper pigmentation or flares of my rosacea since I've been using it. \n\nI'd say this is a good option for anyone looking for a silicone-free zinc-oxide only mineral sunscreen. I think it would perform best for people with dry/normal skin. It seems to be protective, the texture is nice, and it doesn't leave a noticeable whitecast, greasiness, or chalkiness. It's not waterproof, but holds on during my walks if I get sweaty. Overall, I'm fairly impressed and likely will repurchase this!",

I read rave reviews of Vanicream cleanser so I decided to buy some in addition to snail mucin, Tret, etc. I did make the mistake of incorporating several products at once but couldn’t figure out why I suddenly started breaking out like crazy. Even when I reverted to just my cleanser and moisturizer I was still getting unusual acne. \n\nThen, when I traveled for the holidays I used a different cleanser and my skin started clearing up. I looked up some other posts about Vanicream cleanser causing acne and it made so much sense! I immediately breakout whenever I use products with coconut oil and the Vanicream cleanser includes coco glucoside and sodium cocoyl glycinate, both of which are derived from coconuts. \n\nI thought that Vanicream was the ultimate sensitive face wash but, for me, it ended up causing almost a year of issues. Just wanted to put it out there!",

WATER (AQUA). GLYCERIN. DISODIUM COCO-GLUCOSIDE CITRATE. DECYL GLUCOSIDE. SODIUM COCOAMPHOACETATE. PENTYLENE GLYCOL. AQUAPHILUS DOLOMIAE FERMENT FILTRATE. ARGININE. CITRIC ACID. COPPER SULFATE. SODIUM CHLORIDE. TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE. TROMETHAMINE. XANTHAN GUM. ZINC SULFATE\n\n**Size / Cost:** £7.99 per 200ml\n\n**Texture/Feel:** Blue, watery gel, very light foam, no fragrance\n\n**Review:**\n\nA bit about my skin for context: I have hypersensitive skin that does not tolerate most cosmetics, rosacea & periorbital dermatitis flare-ups and mild acne. Combination skin with dry cheeks and oily t-zone.\n\nFor my skin type, I've been recommended lightweight cream cleansers, but most will irritate me or leave a residue that flares my dermatitis.\n\nI was a big fan of Avene Tolerance Cleansing Emulsion before it was discontinued. My rosacea to the new formula of Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser, Avene Cleansing Foam and I was stripped red raw by all of their other gel cleansers, so I was scared to try this but I'm very pleasantly surprised.\n\nThis feels extremely gentle and non-stripping due to gentle surfactants and a heavy dose of glycerin. It works both on my dry cheeks and oily forehead.\n\nIt contains copper sulfate (which give it its blue colour) and zinc sulfate, both of which have antimicrobial properties, and I've found that it helped to flatten small breakouts on my forehead and chin. It also works to calm periorbital dermatitis around my eyes, maybe due to the anti-inflammatory action of both of these ingredients.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this **10/10**, and I've found it gentler than cult favourites Balea Wash Gel and Bioderma Sensibio Gel Cleanser.",

I suppose cleanser is an easy step for everyone else but for me its one of the hardest to find one that works without clogging me (can’t have residue), cleansing properly (or my pores clog by itself) or destroying my skin (my barrier is easily cleansed away). Also a 10/10 from me. \n\nI guess now we have two people talking about this here 👌🏼",

    "body": "Skin Type: Combination Skin\n\n**➡️Sage Apothecary Activated Charcoal & Tea Tree Face Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 549/- for 100 ml, but is always on discount on Amazon. Currently for Rs. 269/-. I had bought it as a trial from Smytten\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Cherry Blossom, Charcoal Powder, Tea Tree, Aloe Vera leaf juice.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua\n Decyl Glucoside \nLauryl Sarcosinate\nCarbomer\nPhenoxyethanol\nSugar\nPropane Glycol\nGlycerine\nSodium Cocoamphoacetate\nDMDM Hydantoin\nPolyquat 10\nEDTA\nAloe Vera Leaf Juice\nActivated Charcoal Powder\nTea Tree essential oil\nPeppermint essential oil\nCherry blossom essential oil\n\n**Claims:** Paraben free, cruelty free, formulated with 100% natural ingredients\n\n**Texture:** Black liquid\n\n**Packaging:** Tube/Bottle\n\n**Usage:** For a few weeks\n\n**My Experience:** This was my first attempt at a charcoal based product. The idea that it removes blackheads & whiteheads from a mere face wash drew me in. But sadly, this didn’t do anything. \n\nI know that pores don’t open or close, but this facewash made me think as if they are opening wide. My skin looked weird. This facewash felt harsh, stinged my eyes that eventually I threw it away. \n\nI’ve gotta ask, Is it worth trying a charcoal based products or are they all farce?\n\n\n**➡️Plum Green Tea Pore Cleansing Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 495/- for 120 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Glycolic Acid, Green Tea Extracts, Natural Cellulose Beads\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Carbomer, Cellulose, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fda Approved Colours, Fragrance, Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, SLS & mineral oil, vegan, cruelty free. Suited for oily, acne prone, combination skin\n\n**Texture:** Transparent liquid with green granules type beads\n\n**Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** It was pretty okay. I didn’t enjoy either the fragrance or the texture. It has tiny green granules, granules not beads that usually absorb into your skin on pressing between your fingers. Due to it, it has felt like a mild scrub than a facewash and I’m not comfortable using a scrub like product on my face daily.\n\nIt also felt mildly harsh on my skin, which is why after a few uses, I was easily turned off. \n\nI still have the product left, that I’m now using to clean makeup brushes. It might work on other skins, but not for me. \n\n**➡️Re’equil Fruit AHA Face Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 490/- for 200 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Fruit AHAs\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Decyl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Aqua, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/​Leaf Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Buteth-3, Tributyl Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Ci 19140, Ci 45100\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, sulphates, silicones & mineral oil.\n \n**Texture:** Yellow coloured fluid. (almost looks like Pee)\n\n**Fragrance:** No fragrance\n\n**Packaging:** Bottle\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** This is the harshest facewash I’ve ever used in my life. The texture is so watery but generates foam easily after coming in contact with water. However, after every wash, my skin felt very tight, which  is why after a few washes, I stopped using it.\n\nSeeing as I still had some product left, I decided to use it instead of shower gel. Damn, My skin felt so smooth after first wash that since then, I’ve been using them as Shower gels for Bath. \n\nI wouldn’t recommend this facewash to anyone seeing how harsh it was compared to other facewash. So think before you buy.\n\n_________________\n\nThanks for reading 💕",

Doesn't lather much and does not dry out the skin either. I use it when i need a light cleanse, for example after an oil cleansing balm that emulsifies. I wouldn't recommend using it after a first cleanser like a carrier oil that doesn't emulsify on its own as it it won't be able to remove the oil. Will not recommend it to use to remove sunscreen alone it is really gentle for that. I got it on a 30%+ sale from vanity wagon, hence it was a good deal at that price. While finding out the ingredients list for this post, I realized it has so many fragrance components that a lot of people in this sub wouldn't appreciate, but YMMV I guess?!! (I got it a year ago when I didn't have any skincare knowledge and was attracted to ayurvedic brands. Having said that I don't regret this purchase at all and I still believe SoulTree is one of the better ayurvedic brands. Personally I'm not allergic to fragrance yet, so I don't mind it) It maybe perfect for a gentle morning cleanser too as its the perfect amount of gentle but personally I don't use a cleanser in the morning. It has a pH of 5 as per the website. Haven't tested myself.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status: WRP if I don't find a better alternative (only if it is on sale, I don't believe in spending 600 on a cleanser, the only purpose of which is to clean).",

(This is not at all sponsored, I paid for my whole shipment, I just wanted to help others out who want to hear about it.)\n\nIt's a mineral sunscreen with 9.4% zinc oxide, unscented, and labeled as \"grease-free and no-clog\". Although I know some people were disappointed that it's not a chemical formula, it was exciting for me to see because my skin is sensitive and reacts to most chemical filters.\n\nThe formula is super lightweight, and rubs in completely clear. I have white but slightly tanned skin, and there is no white cast on my skin at all. (Although I can't vouch for how it would look on darker skin tones.) Personally I've never tried a mineral sunscreen that hasn't left at least a slight white cast on my skin - this one doesn't.\n\nThe formula is originally a bit tacky, but dries down comfortably matte after 1-2 minutes. It's not drying, nor greasy. I can't yet vouch for how well it protects my skin, or if my skin will break out from it, but it's the most comfortable mineral based sunscreen I've tried.\n\nIt's $14 for 1.4 oz, and here are the inactive ingredients: Water, Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Squalane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Extract, Polyester-5, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethyl Ferulate, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Sodium Chloride, Phospholipids, Gluconolactone, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Urea, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nedit: I will say that the pump on the packaging is wonky, only really works at a very specific angle, which is a bit annoying. Although another bonus I forgot to mention, is that I can apply it close to my eyes without any irritation or stinging. ",

I didn't have issues over summer a few months ago.. which makes me really interested if they did infact change the ingredients??\n\n Today it happened again after backcountry snowboarding all day. I haven't used the acne formula in weeks now. Today I decided to try the sunscreen again (hesitantly) and again after a few hours being home (roughly 8hrs after application) my face is red and effed up again...",

I found *it*. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkin type: normal-dry\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a low pH cleanser, you don't need much (I always use more than i should at night). Everytime I use it my face is visibily brighter, cleaner, fresher, all those adjectives. This cleanser makes me glow. AND if i have a pimple it's visibly reduced after just one use. The pimple's not gone but it is smaller and after 2 days *it is* gone. This cleanser does not dry me out at allllllll. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a godsend i need everyone to try it. I was kinda hesitant to try this because most of the reviewers I watched had oily skin but I honestly think any skin type can use this and see results. (I don't have every skin type so could be wrong. Edit: i was wrong) I don't think I'm gonna search for another cleanser like ever. I'm hesitant to call anything a HG but this is my HG. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngrediants:  \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\n*\\* Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser contains 40% of Matcha and is formulated with pH of 5.0-6.0 (pH may vary by batch). All KraveBeauty products are vegan-friendly, cruelty-free, and formulated without fragrance, essential oil, colorant. The color of the product might vary by batch or even change over time. Rest assured, this will not affect the product’s effectiveness; it remains completely safe for your skin.*",

Prior to this, I've only ever used what I thought were proper cleansers.. you know the ones that leave your face feeling like it's going to peel off because of how harsh it is? Okay, I exaggerate, but you get it! So this VAUNT one is super mild, gentle, does not foam, and once I wash my face with it, my skin feels good, oh-so-soft! Doesn't leave my face feeling squeaky-clean and drier than my already dry skin (I'm looking at you The Face Shop's Herb Day 365 Aloe Cleansing Foam). So this was pretty great, considering it was my first time using a gentle face wash and it wasn't a disappointment! It did remove my sunscreen *at times* (I was using Bello Photostable then) but I double cleanse anyway, so it didn't bother me. Same goes for makeup too as I personally double cleanse then as well. As for the amount I used, it was a just a little bit, 2-3 pumps. The pump is not great when it comes to the end of the product, unfortunately (and this is a common complaint I've seen!). I tried getting the product out but couldn't so had to throw the bottle away with that little amount left :/ \n* ***Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status -*** WRP!\n\n\\-\n\nThat's about it! I didn't mention anything about the fragrance because I don't remember :( BUT it felt like it was mostly no fragrance or just a little? Either way I don't usually mind fragrances in my products as I'm not allergic to it. Please feel free to ask me any doubts you have!! I love giving detailed answers AKA I talk a lot and don't shut up ooopss\n\nI've added this to the Megathread as well!!",

I still have the Kale-alu-yAHA Toner in my stash to be used sometime this summer/fall though. Other than that I have reviewed everything from the line and the hits have been the Beet Shield and Great Barrier Relief. One miss (for me) was the Oat So Simple Water Cream…and I’m sorry to say this cleanser is another.\n\nThe Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser is a thick/jelly-like water based cleanser that focuses on mild cleansing while imparting some hydration to the skin. Featured ingredients here include Green Tea Leaf Water, Green Tea Leaf Powder, Hemp Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Oat Kernel Extract, and Soapbark Extract. There are little “bits” of what I think is the Green Tea Leaf Powder floating around in the jelly here and there…which ads to the interesting look of this amber/green jelly.\n\nMy first impressions of this cleanser were pretty positive. I was intrigued by the texture…and that was only heightened when I applied it to damp skin. This jelly doesn’t really “break down” in water right away like a typical water based cleanser. Rather, it almost smoothes out and creates a really slippery/slidery (LOL) layer that is actually kind of fun to play with. After about 10-15 seconds or so…the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser does foam up slightly and become more “traditional” in style. \n\nEven with the lower amount of foam or lather, I found this cleanser to be decent at removing any residual impurities left behind by my first step cleanser (or by itself in my AM routine). I even began taking to adding just a bit of this to a whip maker that I use…creating a much more intense lather. I usually only did this in my AM routine as that is when I take a shower (and the whip maker lives in the shower/I’m too lazy to grab it at night). Either way, I got pretty much the same result with both methods. \n\nAlthough I didn’t really feel like this cleanser was “hydrating” my skin…it didn’t feel like it was drying or stripping in any way. That was until about two-three weeks into the trial.\n\nI began to notice a slight dry/tight feeling around my jaw line and forehead after using the Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser after a few weeks. It wasn’t an all at once/glaring problem, but maybe just after my AM routine and then a day or two later in my PM routine…I just felt like I couldn’t even make it to my actives or toner without feeling kind of dry. Of course other factors play in to the inconsistency…some days I had just exfoliated the night before and others I had maybe used a poor sunscreen during the day (hi Cell Fusion!). But where other pH balanced/gentle cleansers dont intensify the effect…over time the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser did.\n\nBy then end of my trial I was really looking forward to moving this cleanser out of my routine. I don’t want to knock or “ call out” the scent here…but I am. Krave Beauty doesn’t use synthetic fragrance and this product is essential oil free as well which is honestly a great thing. But the scent that does come through (for me) is kind of “industrial” in a way LOL…I guess kind of like plastic. Its not unbearable by any means, but for me it wasn’t great. Each time I used this product I looked back to my time with the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Brightening Cleansing Foam as a very fond (although essential oil filled) memory. \n\nAside from all of that (results, scent)…I think I just have to come clean and say I don’t think these thicker/jelly style cleansers are for me in general. I wrote my review of the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel in 2018 and going back to it now I was shocked by how similar my review of that product was compared to what you’ve just read. “Texture is thick/unique, smells okay, made my skin dry after a while…”…literally the same flow and talking points (although I hope I have improved my skincare review game in that time). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgkfl4slnmt41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0629b1c0fd6de31259da451ee33d2fc741e91bf2\n\nSo, I’m not sure what it is. I could try cutting back to only one water cleanse a day or maybe I need to change how much I use (about a large pea sized amount…which probably only makes sense in my head LOL). Or, maybe the formulation of these thicker water based cleansers just doesn’t agree with my skin for whatever reason. Regardless, I just don’t see myself coming back to this product or being able to wholeheartedly recommend it. I have one more (actually two since I bought it during a 1+1 sale on Jolse) cleanser that from what I’ve seen matches this style…its the OneOSeven Low pH Chaga Cleanser and I’m hoping it will change my mind.\n\nAnyone looking for a gentle and effective hydrating cleanser with the added boost of antioxidants/calming (which the Matcha/Green Tea in this Krave Beauty cleanser offers) should really check out the Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser. To me, it is superior in nearly every way. I found that product to be very gentle and hydrating to the point that it almost doubled as a toner for me. The consistency, texture when lathering, and application were also much more my style (decent amount of lather from a thinner product). And, the fresh cut greenery/refreshing scent is really something special. All of that in a product that costs just slightly more per oz than the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser.\n\nI hear so many people rave about this product and it feels so wrong to go against the grain here. But I felt the same way about the Then I Met You cleanser…not for me.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $16.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser)",

I would actually be a little scared to use it on days where my skin felt dry or a little irritated because it definitely leaves a bit of a tight feeling for me. Not as much as the Cosrx good morning gel cleanser! But it's almost there",

    "body": "Hey guys. Balea MED Ultra Sensitive Waschgel is a very famous product among people who has very sensitive and dry skin. They all swore that this product is their holy grail and a must in their routine. I have a **combination-oily acne prone skin, suffered fungal acne** and still is, but decided to give this product a try. The product is gel-textured and really nice on your skin. It has no fragrance, which is essential in my everyday routine. It should left my skin hydrated but unfortunately this product does not agree with my skin. My skin doesn't like it very much because somehow after rinsing off the cleanser, my skin feels a bit tight and a bit itchy. I believe this is due to the ingredients in the product that can aggravate fungal acne.\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\nAQUA, GLYCERIN, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, METHYLPROPANEDIOL, SODIUM ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PANTHENOL, BISABOLOL, SODIUM COCOAMPHOACETATE, POLYGLYCERYL-4 CAPRATE, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, **~~GLYCERYL OLEATE~~**, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, **~~SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE~~**, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CITRIC ACID, **~~HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE~~**, TOCOPHEROL.\n\nThe bolded and strikedthrough ingredients may be the culprit behind the aggravation of fungal acne. Until now I can't stop scratching cheeks and forehead lightly. URGH\n\nThese are my honest review, like always you guys should take it with a grain of salt. I'm not against this product, it's just that my skin hates it.\n\nDifferent people have different reaction to different products. Find one that suits you.\n\nIf you still haven't found your holy grail, don't worry. Be thankful for the journey of finding them, because you will learn a lot, not only about which ingredient is good or bad, but also discovering about yourself and building your mental strength :)\n\n(No worries tho, I've given the cleanser to my boyfriend who has combination dry skin, and his skin is loving it, so it's a win-win situation here)",

However, whenever I used it I would notice tiny rash like bumps on my chin and cheeks and occasionally a few white heads. I checked the ingredients but couldn’t find anything that could possibly irritate my skin. I’ve never had fungal acne but after I read this I’m not so sure.

    "body": "TL;DR Foaming cleanser with Coco-Glucoside was too stripping. Started experimenting with the emulsion-cream formula (Sodium Polyacrylate, oils, Glycerin, surfactants/solubilizers) – better but still too strong. Got some random papules. Need help with a cleansing formula to make it less stripping but without residue that might contribute to acne. A simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe left a residue, got some papules and one nodule because of it.\n\nDetailed version:\n\nSince simple foaming cleanser with just 2.7% Coco-Glucoside (and less=no foam) was too stripping to my combo (oily-normal-dry) skin I started experimenting with non-foaming emulsion-cream formula.\n\nI used Sodium Polyacrylate (Cosmedia SP) as an emulsifier and thickener. 1-2%, then found that 2 was too much.\n\nI used some surfactants/solubilizers with it, usually Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate at 0.5-5%. 2-5% was too strong. Every time I tried to add Coco-Glucoside (with an additional thickener, like Xanthan Gum), it was too strong, usually, 4 uses and my skin was crying for help. Even with oils, which I describe below.\n\nThen I added some oils, usually caprylic/capric triglyceride or grapeseed oil. 2-5%. Anything below 5% was too strong. I wonder, maybe Cosmedia is just too good at emulsifying sebum on the face. I still want to use it because it feels great at distributing it on a wet face and it's easy to rinse off.\n\nSo it mostly looked something like this:\n\n* 4-5% Oils\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 0.5-2% Surfactants/solubilizers\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* Lactic acid to pH about 6.\n* Then I tried something simple like:\n* 4% Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n\nIt was still a little too strong, but sebum production lowered and my skin calmed down a little.\n\nNext, I tried something like this:\n\n* 2% Grapeseed oil\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 1.1% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 0.85% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 0.5% Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate\n\nToo strong. Added more oils to 5% total. It's better, but my dry areas are still tight (cheeks) and normal areas a little tight. And now I have a problem with 2-5 papules on oily areas (forehead).\n\nSo I'm not sure what could I change and what's causing inflamed pimples – maybe it's still too stripping or it's because of some PEG-7 residue? I read that it's a surfactant AND a refatener.\n\nSpeaking of residues – I tried to make a simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe:\n\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% BTMS-50\n* 2% Cetyl Alcohol\n* 0.5% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* 0.5% Glyceryl Stearate Citrate\n* 0.5% Hydroxyethylcellulose\n\nI used it like 4 times and didn't like it as it left a powdery residue (I think it's a BTMS and/or Cetyl Alcohol?) and I got some papules and one nodule. It was 16 days ago. I read that BTMS can break some people out badly, I wonder if maybe these papules that I've been getting lately was still because of a cleanser with BTMS that I used 4 times 2 weeks ago.\n\nI know it's not a place for acne, but I think it was important to mention it. I think most of my acne is because of just using too stripping cleansers and/or a residue of product.\n\nI am open to suggestions, I can replace Sodium Polyacrylate with something else, but it's hard to get some emulsifiers/solubilizers here in Poland so I'd like to use it.\n\nI use a simple cream after cleansing:\n\n* 5% Dimethicone 350 CST\n* 4% Betaine\n* 2% Sodium Polyacrylate - I think I'll lower it to 1-1.5% because it's a little too thick and it dries too quickly. Or maybe add something like Sorbitol?\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n\nHere's a list of emulsifiers/surfactants/solubilizers (except ingredients which I described above) which I can buy here I Poland:\n\n* Olivem 1000 - I'm afraid a little that it'll contribute to acne, even in a rinse-off product.\n* Creamy Base 1-1-3 *(Aqua, Glycerin, Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Trilaureth-4 phosphate, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin)*\n* Self-emulsifying creamy base *(Glyceryl Stearate Citrate (and) Sucrose Stearate (and) Sucrose Distearate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate (and) Cetyl Alcohol (and) Sodium Ricinoleate)* \\- it contains Fatty Alcohol and I'm not sure if it contributed to acne or it was just BTMS.\n* Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate - the description says it needs to have 15-40% of oils to be stable, so I think it's not a good idea for a cleansing formula.\n* Glyceryl Monostearate - it needs to have pH >6.8\n* SLP *(Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate)*\n* Polysorbate 20, 80, 85\n* *Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate* \\- Again, Fatty Alcohol\n* Simulgel Thickener (Sodium Acrylate / Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer & Isohexadecane & Polysorbate 80) - maybe it would be a better option than just Sodium Polyacrylate\n   * Or this: Emulcold Extra (Sodium Acrylate; Acryloyldimethyl Taurate; Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer; Isohexadecane; Polysorbate 60)\n* Polawax (Emulsifying Wax NF)\n* Gosulin IL *(Isoamyl Laurate & Isoamyl Cocoate) -* not an emulsifier, but I read it can be used to wash off dimethicone easily.\n* Carbomer - I think it can't be used alone to emulsify, but it works well with Sodium Polyacrylamide, so I can use less Cosmedia and lower pH >6 without loss of a viscosity \n* Surfactants:\n   * Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (O110) - I read that it's harsher than Coco-Glucoside.\n   * Decyl Glucoside (O10) - same concerns as above.\n   * Lauryl Glucoside\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids - it's a new ingredient in a shop, I haven't made a research about it yet.\n   * Cocamidopropyl Betaine - I think I'm allergic to amphoteric surfactants or it's because of some of it binds to the skin? My skin is itchy after I use it a couple of days in a row.\n   * Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate - same as above.\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate - a product with it made my hands very dry, so I think I don't want to use it on my face. Which is sad because studies have shown that it's one of the mildest anionics...",

Not sure if you’d be able to find that ingredient in your area. \n\nThe product I got has 25% active surfactant matter, and I use it at 4% in my formula, so the surfactant in the end-product is 1%. \n\nI just used distilled water, a thickener (could be some kind of gum), 0.2% Hyaluronic Acid (instead of glycerin), the SCG (surfactant), and preservative.\n\nIt’s obviously more a gel cleanser than a cream. It doesn’t foam. I just gently massage the gel around my face. It’s enough to get my pores clear. Doesn’t leave any residue. \n\nIf you needed it a bit stronger you could try 5% sodium cococyl glycinate (that’s calculating for a product with 25% active surfactant matter). \n\nAnother thing-  if you want to try a different oil in your formulas, you could try Neossance Squalane (from sugar cane). It is non-irritating and non-acnegenic. Doesn’t have any astringent qualities. Very lightweight but conditioning oil.",

As the price was on the higher side, I waited for discount offers following which, I was finally able to get my hands on it. \n\nOn first application, the texture felt thicker and easy to spread while massaging on face, but it settled nicely on skin. I was pretty impressed with it, but then I read on this sub how Isntree products have to be finished eithin 6 months of opening, and I had an Isntree emulsion luing around, so I decided to finish it first and Put Neutrogena on hold assuming it will survive as it was newly brought & had time before its expiry. \n\nHere's where things started to go wrong. When I started using Neutrogena back after a few weeks, It was still easy to spread, but it pilled. At first, I blamed the sunscreen for it but when it repeated for a different sunscreen, I realised the problem is in the face cream. \n\nNo matter what I tried, Immediate application of sunscreen after face cream or waiting a while, it always pilled. Finally, one day, I kept the face cream in the frige for 24 hours hoping to see some improvement. \n\nThere was improvement, i.e. the pilling didn't stop, but reduced drastically. It was bearable for a week after which, the pillong started.\n\nNo prizes to imagine my disappointment over a brand like Neutrogena letting down by teaching me that even face cream can pill.\n\n**WRP:** WNRP.",

So far everything’s thriving and I’ve never gotten sick in 6 years of this. I also never store my water for any amount of time, even in winter I make sure the hoses stay clear and shunt everything onto the land. My philosophy is that the pathogens that the greywater contains, if it’s not allowed to sit for any amount of time and reproduce, are going into hostile territory when they reach the soil and will get promptly eliminated by either the sun or other microbes. I also wash produce thoroughly (with the water going back into the yard) and prefer cooking or fermenting vegetables, so that probably helps too.

I'm always on the look out for fragrance-free milk and cream cleansers, and I don't like to spend a lot on them really, I'd rather drop the ££ elsewhere in my routine. This one contains meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil and shea butter, which is nice because I always like a few oils in a second/AM cleanser to replace what's lost when you wash your face. It also contains a couple polymers, which apparently stop surfactants from penetrating too deeply and over cleansing your skin. The high oil content here might even mean that this cleanser can break down makeup and water resistant sunscreens, but I haven't tried it to find out yet!\n\nThe surfactants used don't look particularly interesting and seem few and far between, so perhaps this is a better option for those who use a washcloth or who like cleansers that leave a light emollient film, but I thought I'd share this on here since I've never really seen a cleanser this budget (£2 for 200ml!) with such a good INCI. Presumably it's pretty accessible too since it's Sainsbury's own brand, if it's sold in most stores then it'd be pretty easy just to pick up with your shop. It looks like a great budget option for anyone with dry or sensitive skin - isopropyl myristate can be an acne trigger for some so be mindful of that, but it’s in a good few of my favourite cleansers and despite being super acne prone it never breaks me out.\n\nThey also do a [foaming facial wash](https://incidecoder.com/products/source-of-nature-facial-wash) that looks pretty great too - I don't usually bother with foaming cleansers but the ingredients here look pretty promising and it's £2 for 150ml. Come to think of it, it actually looks more interesting than the milk - lots of glycerin, two really great gentle surfactants, soybean oil, but sadly no polymers unlike the milk. They do a toner and a couple night creams (toner doesn't look up to much but the creams look nice), and an eye makeup remover that might be worth looking into too. So pleased to see a budget skincare line formulated with care, and it's so cool that they made them fragrance-free so anybody can try them!\n\n**Source of Nature Cleansing Milk White Tea & Shea Butter:**\n\n*Aqua, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Squalane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycine Soja Oil, Disodium EDTA, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Polysorbate 60, Tocopherol, Citric Acid*\n\n**Source of Nature Facial Wash:**\n\n*Aqua, Glycerin, Coco-Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Glycine Soja Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Tocopherol, Chloroacetic Acid*\n\nYou can find the rest of the product's on [Sainsbury's website](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SearchDisplayView?catalogId=10241&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=44&amp;krypto=%2FDRH%2BBsB4VVnkVm97G%2F8Mu8Bsx8j7NduAzxTe1ccgua5bGLF7lGU%2BINmM35%2B2Ncnumxpqa4cpZzK5G09peKvec46DINkM8jgRfYq%2FEK425jsHdBj5D%2FUSC1VzkdVHP3hM1%2BNZeRNnNz1owO8jHWT9E4cAhUumZ09bC0tuezO4nygeWTndXU%2FwOhCaWRr7qtwdGBbzetv5jrKnyz0vTzNkg%3D%3D), the full INCIs are there.",

I still have the Kale-alu-yAHA Toner in my stash to be used sometime this summer/fall though. Other than that I have reviewed everything from the line and the hits have been the Beet Shield and Great Barrier Relief. One miss (for me) was the Oat So Simple Water Cream…and I’m sorry to say this cleanser is another.\n\nThe Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser is a thick/jelly-like water based cleanser that focuses on mild cleansing while imparting some hydration to the skin. Featured ingredients here include Green Tea Leaf Water, Green Tea Leaf Powder, Hemp Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Oat Kernel Extract, and Soapbark Extract. There are little “bits” of what I think is the Green Tea Leaf Powder floating around in the jelly here and there…which ads to the interesting look of this amber/green jelly.\n\nMy first impressions of this cleanser were pretty positive. I was intrigued by the texture…and that was only heightened when I applied it to damp skin. This jelly doesn’t really “break down” in water right away like a typical water based cleanser. Rather, it almost smoothes out and creates a really slippery/slidery (LOL) layer that is actually kind of fun to play with. After about 10-15 seconds or so…the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser does foam up slightly and become more “traditional” in style. \n\nEven with the lower amount of foam or lather, I found this cleanser to be decent at removing any residual impurities left behind by my first step cleanser (or by itself in my AM routine). I even began taking to adding just a bit of this to a whip maker that I use…creating a much more intense lather. I usually only did this in my AM routine as that is when I take a shower (and the whip maker lives in the shower/I’m too lazy to grab it at night). Either way, I got pretty much the same result with both methods. \n\nAlthough I didn’t really feel like this cleanser was “hydrating” my skin…it didn’t feel like it was drying or stripping in any way. That was until about two-three weeks into the trial.\n\nI began to notice a slight dry/tight feeling around my jaw line and forehead after using the Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser after a few weeks. It wasn’t an all at once/glaring problem, but maybe just after my AM routine and then a day or two later in my PM routine…I just felt like I couldn’t even make it to my actives or toner without feeling kind of dry. Of course other factors play in to the inconsistency…some days I had just exfoliated the night before and others I had maybe used a poor sunscreen during the day (hi Cell Fusion!). But where other pH balanced/gentle cleansers dont intensify the effect…over time the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser did.\n\nBy then end of my trial I was really looking forward to moving this cleanser out of my routine. I don’t want to knock or “ call out” the scent here…but I am. Krave Beauty doesn’t use synthetic fragrance and this product is essential oil free as well which is honestly a great thing. But the scent that does come through (for me) is kind of “industrial” in a way LOL…I guess kind of like plastic. Its not unbearable by any means, but for me it wasn’t great. Each time I used this product I looked back to my time with the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Brightening Cleansing Foam as a very fond (although essential oil filled) memory. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29zlo3kanmt41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d081566bd104fc2e56f887caadc25376a7cb09b8\n\nAside from all of that (results, scent)…I think I just have to come clean and say I don’t think these thicker/jelly style cleansers are for me in general. I wrote my review of the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel in 2018 and going back to it now I was shocked by how similar my review of that product was compared to what you’ve just read. “Texture is thick/unique, smells okay, made my skin dry after a while…”…literally the same flow and talking points (although I hope I have improved my skincare review game in that time). \n\nSo, I’m not sure what it is. I could try cutting back to only one water cleanse a day or maybe I need to change how much I use (about a large pea sized amount…which probably only makes sense in my head LOL). Or, maybe the formulation of these thicker water based cleansers just doesn’t agree with my skin for whatever reason. Regardless, I just don’t see myself coming back to this product or being able to wholeheartedly recommend it. I have one more (actually two since I bought it during a 1+1 sale on Jolse) cleanser that from what I’ve seen matches this style…its the OneOSeven Low pH Chaga Cleanser and I’m hoping it will change my mind.\n\nAnyone looking for a gentle and effective hydrating cleanser with the added boost of antioxidants/calming (which the Matcha/Green Tea in this Krave Beauty cleanser offers) should really check out the Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser. To me, it is superior in nearly every way. I found that product to be very gentle and hydrating to the point that it almost doubled as a toner for me. The consistency, texture when lathering, and application were also much more my style (decent amount of lather from a thinner product). And, the fresh cut greenery/refreshing scent is really something special. All of that in a product that costs just slightly more per oz than the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser.\n\nI hear so many people rave about this product and it feels so wrong to go against the grain here. But I felt the same way about the Then I Met You cleanser…not for me.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $16.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser)",

I've been using Olay's [Pore Minimizing Cleanser + Scrub](http://www.drugstore.com/olay-pore-minimizing-cleanser-scrub/qxp343431?catid=182290) for years, but am finally parting with it due to all the environmental fuss about microbeads. \n\nI am anxious about testing new cleansers. I remember the trial and error of products that burned my skin, (although I have no idea which ingredients caused it) and I'm particular about the way products feel on my skin. Looking to avoid gels, scrubs, and foaming products, and any Neutrogena cleansers -- I still cringe about how badly their Naturals line burned my face.\n\nWith dry, sensitive skin, and living in a desert, I'm looking for a moisturizing milk or cream cleanser. I can tolerate a mild fragrance and like things that smell clean, nutty, or faintly herbal. \n\nAll the product has to do is be pleasant to rinse my face with after OCM or working out and not strip my skin. I have other dedicated products to manage makeup removal and treatments. \n\nMost of my trouble deciding is information overload when looking at ingredients. I generally trust SCA's recommendations, but I've got so much conflicting skincare advice in my head that I don't know what's good or bad anymore. @_@\n\nIt's a cleanser. I'm going to wash it off.

That’s because they’re affordable, effective, and, when properly formulated, not an issue.\n\nRossmann offers intimate wash lotions with that ingredient, and trust me, the formulators design them with the utmost care for delicate areas.

OK, not a sulfate, technically a sulfonate instead... Then I looked it up and found it is primarily used in shampoos. The cleanser was surprisingly effective at removing stuff but also a little bit too stripping for my liking despite all the goodies in the formula. So I am still sort of missing the advantages of this olefin sulfonate surfactant over sodium laureth sulfate. \n\nSomeone?",

Love this as an everyday shampoo, very mild fruity scent. Not sure about the volumizing, but cleans well for a sulfate-free shampoo.\n\nWella Invigo Sensitive Mask\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Betaine, Panthenol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Valine, Methylparaben, Allantoin, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\nLove this hair mask, one of the very few that I’ve found that’s fungal acne safe. I can use it close to my scalp without an uncomfortable feeling.\n\nI haven’t found a great conditioner. Right now I use The Ordinary’s conditioner, which is very basic but at least detangles my knotty hair. Does contain cetearyl alcohol.\n\n\nFace\n\nSkintype: Oily but easily dehydrated, acne-prone\n\nAvène Cicalfate+ Purifying Cleansing Gel\n\nAvene Aqua, Aqua, Glycerin, Disodium Coco-Glucoside Citrate, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Pentylene Glycol, Aquaphilus Dolomiae Ferment Filtrate, Arginine, Citric Acid, Copper Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Trisodium, Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Sulfate.\n\nI haven’t seen much written about this cleanser, but I think it’s really good. Mild but cleansing, non-drying for a gel (more of a liquid texture). It’s blue in color due to the copper in it.\n\nDr. Eddie's Happy Cappy Medicated Shampoo\n\nI bit the bullet and ordered this from iHerb (expensive from where I am). It’s really good, I can use it on my face for a couple of minutes and still not get super dry. Calms down the small spots. I use it about three times a week.\n\nGeek & Gorgous Hydration Station\n\nWater, C15-19 Alkane, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG/ PPG/ Polybutylene Glycol-8/ 5/ 3 Glycerin, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Ectoin, Xylitylglucoside, Bisabolol, Allantoin, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Glucose, Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nVery moisturising for a moisturiser geared towards oily skin and it doesn’t break me out.  Great for winter.\n\nBioderma Sebium Sensitive\n\nAqua/Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Dipropylene Glycol, Zinc Gluconate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Sodium Polyacrylate, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Bakuchiol, Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Sodium Metabisulfite, Rhamnose, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Tocopherol, Fructooligosaccharides, Fragrance (Parfum).\n\nLight moisturiser, it’s fragranced but I don’t mind this particular scent (kind of fresh). Actually feels soothing on the skin, but only 30 ml. \n\nBonus:\n\nPurito Daily Soft Touch Sunscreen\n\nWater, Propanediol, Dibutyl Adipate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Amylopectin, Butylene Glycol, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Glycerin, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Disterarate, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Carbomer, Tromethamine, Decyl Glucoside, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Alpha-Bisabolol, Panthenol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ceramide NP, Dipropylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide NS, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide EOP\n\nThis sunscreen is not technically safe (esters), but for some reason it works for me. I have tried a LOT of sunscreens and they break me out, makes me shiny, dehydrates etc. The finish is not matte, but not shiny on me when in sinks in. And it doesn’t break me out!",

    "body": "Hi everyone, I suffer from dry skin and eczema, I'm also growing out my hair (currently tailbone length). I switched to sulfate free shampoos almost two years ago. I've tried around 5 different types, all targeted towards people with allergies or babys.  All fit the same criteria: no perfume, alcohol, sulfates, silicones or liquid polymers. While my scalp is now in excellent condition, I keep noticing that after using sulfate-free shampoo, my hair will get badly tangled and dull. It's difficult to brush and I end up ripping through it which does cause some damage. :/ The main surfactants in those shampoos are either coco-glucoside or lauryl glucoside. \nHas someone had the same issues? If so, is there a fix for this? \nCould it be another ingredient that I should look out for? \nI'm very reluctant to use normal shampoo again because I'm scared of getting a dry, bleeding scalp. But sulfates leave my hair so smooth and shiny. :/",

        "body": "So, baby shampoo’s key characteristic is to not hurt when it gets into baby’s eyes. Cuz you know, babies = splashing = foam in eyes. To do this the shampoo pH is close to tears for the sake of the eyes. This pH turns out to be too high for hair, so the shampoo is alkaline. Alkaline shampoos lift the cuticle, which would increase friction and mechanical damage, aka would end up tangling and frizzing more easily. Stick with adult formulas :) There is a higher chance of the pH being around 5-5.5, which is good for the hair.\n\nThe other thing to look for is how you are actually massaging the shampoo on your scalp. Going in circles seems to create tangles. Move your fingers back and forth instead, if you are massaging the shampoo on scalp in circular patterns.",

Then I let it sit for 10min in the shower while I shave or wash, whatever. \n2) rinse conditioner, squeeze water out of hair without any friction to the hair (no tousling etc.) and let air dry \n3) limit the overall number of washes, I do 1 or 2 per week but I brush my hair often. Should be fine if you don’t have oily hair. \n4) once in a while, maybe 1x per month do an olive oil and/or coconut oil mask. Drench your scalp and ends, let sit for min of 30min, up to 2-3hours.

Nice to see that the hydrating offering doesn't include the problematic (well for me anyway) ester forms of emollient alcohols, though the caveat is that it might not be hydrating enough. The Kids Lotion looks to be a very good middle of the road (as well as extremely affordable) option if you don't mind alcohol so much, but want a little less of it. \n\nAlso if anyone notices something wrong with the listings (like mispellings) please tell me! I had to manually re-type it as the email they sent was weirdly formatted and pasting it here ended up with lots of blank spaces. I figured it would be faster to just re-type it rather than erase the blank space.",

I recently fell in love with [this sunscreen](https://www.cantabrialabs.com/en/products/heliocare-color-gelocream-spf-50/) but have a labeling question: My novice understanding of how sunscreen protection is labeled across the pond is that UVA must be at least 1/3 of the labeled SPF for them to advertise UVA protection. I noticed that this package says \"broad spectrum\" but doesn't have the little circle around the UVA letters that I typically see to signify UVA of at least SPF/3. Can anyone help me decode what this labeling means? Can I assume that this product has UVA protection <SPF/3? \n\nI know we can't infer SPF/PPD/UVAPF from presence of filters alone, but in case it's helpful this sunscreen contains Tinosorb S (Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine) as the highest sunscreen ingredient on the inci and also contains Uvasorb HEB  and avobenzone, all of which I believe cover at least part of the UVA spectrum. Full inci below (from incidecoder):\n\nAqua, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, **Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine**, Ci 77891, **Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hexylene Glycol, **Ethylhexyl Salicylate**, **Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane**, Polysilicone-15, **Titanium Dioxide**, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Myristyl Alcohol, Coco-Glucoside, Dipropylene Glycol Dibenzoate, Ceteareth-25, **Ethylhexyl Triazone**, Polypodium Leucotomos Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ci 77492, Myristyl Glucoside, Disodium Ethylene Dicocamide PEG-15 Disulfate, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether Benzoate, Ci 77491, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ci 77019, Camellia Sinensis, Manganese Dioxide, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Parfum, Propylene Carbonate, BHT, Linalool, Limonene\n\nPlease forgive my relative ignorance on ex-US sunscreens and newbie status on this sub :) \n\nFWIW, I also tried the [HELIOCARE 360º Color Gel Oil-Free SPF 50+](https://www.cantabrialabs.com/en/products/heliocare-360-color-gel-oil-free-spf-50/), but it is far inferior in terms of wearability IMO (happy to share my thoughts on each separately if anyone is interested). That product still doesn't have the little UVA circle but it is labeled as PA++++.",

I used to use just any regular shampoo, conditioner and soap twice a day supposedly to remove chlorine after each pool session but apparently it’s not working because I still smell like chlorine. I used to not care much about the smell of chlorine that lingers on my hair and skin but I do mind the damage. My dark brown, fine, straight hair does dry out and changes to lighter color plus my skin is perpetually dry.\n\nI am trying to be more caring to my hair and skin this year, I make sure to shower before getting into the pool, I have added a clarifying shampoo weekly and applying hair masks whenever I feel like the ends of my hair needs it which lately is looking like I have to do it more about 3x a week. Side note, my scalp is extremely oily too so I’m only using the hair mask on the bottom half of my hair. My hair mask has a really strong fragrance too and it kinda hides the chlorine smell from my hair. \n\nReading up on some posts, I probably need a chelating shampoo. Usual chlorine-neutralizing shampoo brands like ultraswim  are not readily available in my country and it’ll be super expensive if I try to order one so I researched a bit more and I figured I need any product with EDTA. \n\nSo anyway, I found this baby hair and body wash and I saw that it has EDTA in the ingredients. Can I use this as my shampoo and shower gel after a session in the pool? Would this remove chlorine or would buying and using this be a bad idea? I’ll list the ingredients below:\n\nIngredients: Purified Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Whey Filtrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Citric Acid, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Benzoic Acid, Lactic Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nWould really appreciate any opinions or advice.

Have you checked the ingredients on shampoos you’ve used in the past to see if any of them have an EDTA?\n\nI think the SLES in that shampoo could probably be a big help in cleansing your hair, especially if you were using something sulfate-free before. But if that doesn’t work, could you ask a hairstylist in your country for product recommendations?\n\nIf Bumble and bumble products are sold in your country, I found their Sunday shampoo worked great for chelating.",

In the article I linked above, it has a recipe for doing a hair rinse with diluted citric acid.\n\nThat same blog has [another article on hard water](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/03/hard-water-and-your-hair.html) and using chelating agents for removing minerals, it lists some products that you might look for, and chelating ingredients to look for in your products if you don't find those specific products.",

I know HoneyPot has a lot of bells and whistles, like Colloidal Silver & lots of exotic extracts, but I want to make something that is cost efficient yet pampering.

This TaraLee youtube video was used for slight reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ4JrDJ7Km8&t=185s.\n\nSo, the very tentative formula goes as such (LC refers to I will buy it from LotionCrafter, AO refers to already owned):\n\n* 57.5 % Distilled Water\n* 10% Coco-Glucoside (LC)\n* 20% Aloe Vera Juice (LC)\n* 10% Lavender Hydrosol (LC)\n* 2% Chamomile Extract (LC)\n* 0.5% Germaben II (AO)\n* Citric Acid to balance pH\n\nI am still relatively new to this, as I have only made facial mists (w/o oil-based products) and oil cleansers. Some other ingredients I have on hand are: Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Oats, Glycerin, and Centella Asiatica Extract. If you have any edits/addition recommendations, or even want to point to a cheaper supplier, I would greatly appreciate it!",

It's available through Lotioncrafter and Formulator Sample Shop. I highly recommend getting this.\n\nC12-15 Alkyl Benzoate sounds like a good switch. Or you can probably use more Coco Caprylate Caprate if you have it. I love CCC.\n\nMore Lauryl Laurate might work in place of of Behenyl Behenate, or you can try Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Esters or Oliwax LC (Cetyl Palmitate, Sorbitan Palmitate, Sorbitan Olivate.)\n\nI think you need a polymeric thickener, even if you don't use the exact one they used (Sepinov EMT-Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acriloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer.)\n\nPolymeric thickeners not only dramatically increase stability, they create very very elegant products when used alongside nonionic emulsifiers (like Montanov 202.)\n\nMy favorite polymeric thickener is Aristoflex AVC, also available through Lotioncrafter and cheaper than Sepinov EMT.\n\nI've seen people switch out polymeric thickeners for Xanthan Gum (both polymeric thickeners and Xanthan Gum are water gelling agents, hence the increased stability with both,) but I don't think Xanthan Gum compares. At all. \n\nI also love Sodium Carbomer, another polymeric thickener. \n\nYou have to be careful with polymerics because many are electrolyte intolerant. So usually you can't use things like Aloe Vera, hydrolyzed proteins, etc. Sepimov EMT is slightly more electrolyte tolerant than Aristoflex AVC.\n\nMore Propanediol sounds great, personally I love it, find it very effective and much more elegant than Glycerin.\n\nI would skip the surfactant completely.",

So I would like to review this product and give a summary of what I have learned about European sunscreens in general.\n\nAfter doing all this sunscreen research, I decided that I want the best UVA protection that I can get.  That means looking to Europe to get some high-quality sunscreens.  Here is a [reminder chart about UVB/UVA](http://imgur.com/VO5B0FE) which shows that year-round, even indoors, UVA is reaching you.  European sunscreens don’t always advertise the UVA protection value. In the EU, you will see the SPF number (which indicates UVB protection) and you will probably see [the letters UVA with a circle around it](http://imgur.com/VGlep5d). This means that the UVA protection is at least 1/3 of the SPF number.  Bioderma is one of the only brands I have seen which advertises the UVA protection.\n \nI was in Europe a few months ago and I was very confused about how to read the ingredient lists.  The active ingredients are not separated from the inactive ingredients and they are listed under their INCI names instead of their common names.  I made a table below of common active ingredients and their other names, plus some other relevant information. If you have any additions or corrections for the table, let me know!\n\n\nTrade Name | Other Names | INCI Name | Protects against | UV absorption\n---|---|----|----|----\nParsol 1789, Eusolex 9020, Escalol 517 | Avobenzone | Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane | UVA | maximum of 357 nm\nMexoryl SX | Ecamsule | terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid |  | \nMexoryl XL |  | Drometrizole trisiloxane | UVA, UVB| two absorption peaks: one at 303 nm (UVB) and one at 344 nm (UVA)\nTinosorb S | Bemotrizinol | bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazin | UVA, UVB | \nTinosorb M | Bisoctrizole | methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol | UVA, UVB | \nUvinul T 150 |  | Ethylhexyl triazone | UVB | Maximum of 314 nm\nUvinul A Plus |  | Diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate | UVA | Maximum of 354 nm\n\n\t\n\n**Ingredients for Bioderma Photoderma LEB spray** (I have written the common name into brackets for the active ingredients):\n\nAqua/water/eau, dicaprylyl carbonate, diisopropyl sebacate, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol [Tinosorb M], butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane [Avobenzone], bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine [Tinosorb S], cyclopentasiloxane, methylpropanediol, decyl glucoside, ectoin, mannitol, xylitol, rhamnose, fructooligosaccharides, laminaria ochroleuca extract, c20-22 alkyl phosphate, c20-22 alcohols, microcrystalline cellulose, coco-glucoside, xanthan gum, cellulose gum, pentylene glycol, propylene glycol, cetearyl alcohol, caprylic/capric triglyceride, sodium hydroxide, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, chlorphenesin. [bi 656]\n\n**Special Features:** \n\n* Patent Cellular Bio-protection (mannitol + ectoine): Supports the skin's natural defense function, protects the cell's DNA and prevents light-induced skin aging. \n\n* Brown algae: Anti-inflammatory effect. \n\n* UV filters: Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Avobenzone: Absorb UVA radiation. SPF 30 / UVA 30 as the optimal ratio for sun allergies.\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* Alcohol-free and fragrance-free \n\n* $25-30 to import from France\n\n* Available on Amazon and [French Cosmetics for Less](http://www.frenchcosmeticsforless.com/proddetail.php?prod=734503&cat=112)\n\n* 125 mL bottle\n\n* Photostable\n\n**My review:**\n\nIt comes in a pump spray bottle.  I found that 10 sprays are equal to 1/4 teaspoon, which makes it very easy to apply without bringing out the measuring spoon every time I use it.  It is a thin liquid which is easy to rub into my skin.  It feels very light when applied. I was surprised to see that there was a little white cast, considering that it doesn’t contain any physical sunscreen. However, after using this a few times, I have decided that the white cast isn’t that bad if you make sure to blend it in properly. If you don’t rub it in, you will be left with white streaks. If I use it on my eyelids, for example, I get obvious white creases.  It does leave a sheen, but I wouldn’t say that it’s greasy. My skin does get shiny on its own, so it's hard to tell. Overall, I am happy to find a light, non-greasy sunscreen that comes in a 125 mL bottle.  I will admit that I’ve only used this for 4 days, but I think it’s enough to make a fair assessment.  I have enjoyed using it so far.  I took a few photos, which may be helpful. [Album](http://imgur.com/a/wdNlT).\n\n**Some other sunscreens I have tried for comparison:**\n\n* Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 42 For Face. Perhaps the only truly matte sunscreen I’ve ever used.  A thin liquid which applied easily, but left a white cast.  I loved the matte look, wasn’t crazy about the white cast, and I could tolerate the fragrance. However, I was concerned about the long-term effects of using a product with so much alcohol in it.\n\n* Shiseido Urban Environment UV Protection Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 40 For Face/Body. Similar to the version for face, but this is a cream.  It left both a white cast and sometimes a sheen to my skin.\n\n* EltaMD UV Daily Broad-Spectrum SPF 40. Fragrance-free and alcohol-free is why I initially chose it.  I love how light and pleasant this feels, though there can be a bit of a sheen to it. Virtually no white cast. I emailed EltaMD about the PPD value, but they did not respond.  They have said previously that all of their sunscreens have a PPD of 8-16.\n\n* Vichy Capital Soleil Dry Touch Face Emulsion SPF 50 [European Version]. I almost considered doing a separate review for this, but for several reasons I will not write a full review. First, I can’t find much information online, so I think this has been discontinued and a SPF 30 version is in its place? It is a thick cream which is absorbed quickly. It has a velvety feel on my skin.  While it is not truly matte, it is not greasy and gives my skin a “glow”. It is alcohol-free and leaves no white cast at all. However, it has a VERY strong perfume in it.  It fades after an hour or two. The fragrance something I neither love nor hate. I also couldn’t find an exact PPD value for this, although it should be at least 16+.\n\n* Garnier Amber Solaire Sensitive Advanced Sensitive Advanced Protection SPF 50+. Unfortunately, this is the only sunscreen I took home from Europe.  I very much disliked it and I don’t think it really deserves to be reviewed. It has a strong, off-putting plastic smell to it.  It leaves my face extremely shiny.  It feels heavy and greasy on my skin, even my arms, and makes me feel hot and sweaty when I put it on. It was, however, only 7 Euros for 200 mL and I now use it for the backs of my hands several times per day.\n\nIf you have any questions, just ask!  \n",

        "body": "Ok, both of those washes do, in fact, look like cleansers :)  Neither of them include soaps or detergents, and they look ok to try.  I'm not sure why the Clearasil one contains clays... that would be typically to be oil-absorbing.  It might be slightly drying, but you could try it.  The goat wash actually looks great.  I'd use that on my face any time.  \n\nThe Repair Dry Skin Cream looks pretty good .  - but the % of product doesn't add up to 100% so I'm not sure what else is in there.  But it's a lot of glycerin,  mineral oil and wax, essentially.  \n\nSome people find that chemical sunscreens are mroe comedogenic than physical sunscreens - I know that I do.  So that might also be something to think about.\n\nUsing some AHA would probably be nice as well - it's really helped my skin be smoother, softer, more uniform in color and way less clog-prone.",

    "body": "Recently my scalp has been itching real bad, and flakes are starting to fall (especially when I'm under a bright light and/or wearing dark colored clothes). I've already switched to a SLS, silicone, and paraben free shampoo for the past 7 months or so.\n\nI'm 18, male, and my family doesn't have a history of seborrheic dermatisis (but I inherited \"hives\" from my father's side, so most of my body and sometimes face gets hives once in a while). My scalp doesn't redden anyway so that's probably irrelevant. I haven't experienced anything with my scalp until about April of 2015 where I just started getting white flakes (along with hormonal acne, etc.). It's almost been 2 years and I can't seem to get rid of it permanently. I live in a humid, polluted urban area in Southeast Asia. I've tried shampooing every other day, every two days, but nothing seems to help calm my scalp and remove the flakes. My hair gets oily when I do no-poo because of the environment that I live in.  I've used Head and Shoulders, CLEAR (Asian Brand), and many anti-dandruff shampoos, but it worsened if not did nothing for my itchy scalp. I don't consume meat (pescatarian), and eat a lot of carbs, veggies, fruits and moderate amounts of seafood, if diet has anything to do with my scalp balance. I've tried VCO, ACV, and none of them have helped as well. Nizoral, I did try, it kept my scalp in check for a couple of days, and then it went back to showing visible white flakes. I just used Nizoral to calm the itchiness as we speak. I don't know whether it's dandruff or a dry scalp. Here's a picture of my scalp if any of you could help\n\nThese are the ingredients of the shampoo that I've been using for the past 6 months. aqua (water), sodium cocoyl isethionate (coconut-derived), decyl glucoside (coconut-derived), sodium lactate (sugarcane-derived), sodium gluconate (sugarcane-derived), glycerin (vegetable-derived), Cocos nucifera (virgin coconut) oil, dicaprylyl ether (vegetable-derived), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, olus (vegetable) oil, Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, guar gum, levulinic acid (rice or corn-derived), Mentha piperita (peppermint) essential oil, Mentha arvensis (corn mint) essential oil, coco glucoside (coconut-derived) , glyceryl oleate (coconut -derived), xanthan gum, charcoal (bamboo-derived), phytic acid (rice-derived), anisic acid (anise seed-derived), citric acid\n\nThis is my conditioner: aqua (water), cetearyl alcohol (vegetable-derived), cetrimonium chloride (vegetable-derived), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, olus (vegetable) oil, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, Glycine soja (soybean) oil, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer (vegetable-derived), diheptyl succinate (vegetable-derived), Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, hydroxypropyltrimonium honey, hydrolyzed wheat protein, levulinic acid (rice or corn-derived), fragrance (all-natural), anisic acid (anise seed-derived) (I've tried co-washing once, but it didn't seem to help. I place the conditioner for around 5 minutes long)\n\nThese are local shampoos, under the brand \"Human Nature\"\n\nI would REALLY appreciate anyone's help here. It's embarassing because I have to wear specific light clothing, I've been wearing a cap lately just to prevent flaking from being seen. Should I:\n-buy a natural, imported/from the U.S./Europe shampoos like Rahua?\n-buy a mild (medium level: half synthetic, half natural) shampoo?\n-apply argan oil, or other oils\n-or just go to the dermatologist and get a medicated shampoo?\n\nPlease please help me. I wanna get rid of these flakes for good. \n",

You need to use them regularly for them to be effective, and if it's seb derm you have, you will need to use them forever. Sounds to me like it's dandruff/seb derm rather than dry scalp, though I can't see your picture. There is no cure. You said nizoral worked, there's no reason for it to stop working. You're not using it regularly enough.\n\nAlso, reconsider your use of conditioner. You said your scalp does not become red, which leads me to believe that your hair might be short. Coupled with the fact that you are probably of Asian descent, and thus probably have straight and/or fine hair, I would say that you probably don't need conditioner. If conditioner touches your scalp it can make it oily, which makes seb derm worse. If you want to keep using conditioner, apply only to the length of your hair, avoid the scalp.\n\nI hope that helps.",

I make sure to get an even layer of Product across my entire face and neck while gently massaging got 1-3 minutes. Then, I thoroughly rinse with warm water.\n\nWhy I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Well, as with Glow Recipe...I kind of love Peach & Lily. I have come to really appreciate the work Alicia Yoon and her Team do to create really well formulated Products. So, when this Gel Cleanser was announced...I clicked “Order” the second I could LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that, I was intrigued by the claims that this Cleanser is very soothing and calming as well as being an excellent Cleanser.\n\nOverall Review: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I honestly hadn’t done much research into this Product before plunking down my credit card...it was from Peach & Lily...and I had to have it LOL! So, I didn’t know quite what to expect when I got it into my Routine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The thing that was most apparent (and at the time most worrisome) upon my initial application of this Gel Cleanser was the lack of lather. Don’t get me wrong, this Product does lather A BIT...but to me it felt and applied like some kind of Cleanser/Serum hybrid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The consistency of the Product felt a lot more slippery than I expected, so rather than “scrubbing” my Skin...my hands just slid around my face LOL! It’s hard to describe...but there was certainly a different feeling when using this Power Calm Gel Cleanser. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After the first few uses I was honestly a bit shocked by how well this Product was able to gently cleanse my Skin. I’ve been so used to Foaming Cleanser (pH Balanced of course)...and using this just didn’t seem like it would be enough for my Normal/Combination Skin. But there I was, with Skin feeling super clean yet soft and hydrated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Before I continue...lets talk about the Formula. Camellia Flower Extract, Tea Tree Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Matricaria Flower Extract, Licorice Root Extract, Panthenol, Cucumber Fruit Extract, Peach Fruit Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Aloe Leaf Juice Powder, and Rosemary Leaf Extract all make it fairly high on the Ingredients List. Also, several forms of Hyaluronic Acid are included.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* My biggest feeling of skepticism came from the calming and soothing claims for this Gel Cleanser...but after only a couple of weeks I had to set those aside. This Cleanser really did offer some noticeable calming effects to me Skin not only over time...but pretty much immediately after each use. I found myself relying on this Product post Physical Exfoliation or extractions to just calm everything down (I would Oil Cleanse…so my Exfoliation…then come back in with the Power Calm).  \n\nFor me, this Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser was a one-two punch of an incredibly gentle texture/Application with a soothing/calming/hydrating result. Alicia Yoon describes her Products as being great for all Skin Types...but formulated with her own super sensitive and eczema prone Skin in mind. And I think this Gel Cleanser embodies that more than anything else from the Line (at this point). \n\nFor those with super Oily/Combination Skin...I’m not going to say that this Cleanser will be sufficient for daily use just by itself. I really think and Oil Cleansing Step will be needed in the evening...and possibly even then you might need something a little more powerful. \n\nBut, for those with Drier Skin that need hydration from each and every step in your Routine...I think this is an excellent choice. This Gel Cleanser wont strip or remove anything that it shouldn’t...but rather the Glycerin and Sodium Hyaluronate will impart some watery hydration that you can lock in with a Moisturizer.\n\nAlso, those with Sensitive Skin that are having trouble finding the ideal Cleanser...I would absolutely point you in this direction. I am still not an expert in gentle Cleansers by any means...but this one from Peach & Lily is just so calming and soothing to me. It really helped to reduce redness when I needed it most.\n\nFinally, I know there are a number of people that have tried the “Water Only” Method in the morning in place of a Cleanser...and things didn’t work out (myself included). But on the flip side...some Cleansers can be too drying to use twice a day. I think the Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser would be an amazing option for those that need something gentle/light in the morning!\n\nNow you might be thinking...”Okay Anthony sounds like you found your new HG Cleanser right?”. Well, as far as what’s inside the tube...I think so. It really did blow my mind and make me rethink what an effective Cleanser should look/feel like. But, that plastic tube will keep me from repurchasing this Product time and time again (for now). \n\nI have a couple of Cleansers that promise to be gentle yet effective in my Stash...and they come in glass/resuable bottles. It’s just something that I am trying to lean towards. However, if I cant replicate the success of this Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser...I’ll most likely come back to it eventually. Plastic can be recycled...but I would prefer glass if I can have it LOL!\n\nAs for others, I absolutely would recommend this gem of a Cleanser...especially to those with Sensitive and/or Dry Skin. Another knock out Product from Peach & Lily and I cannot wait to see what they come up with next!\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nDI Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Coco-Glucoside, Tea-Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Citrate, Butylene Glycol, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Panthenol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Cellulose Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pantolactone, Chlorphenesin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyglyceryl-10 Caprylate/Caprate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9w50pvta59p41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=624bca664d3e104f29c01a7b52d491e032911da8",

It's concerning because I thought I had my acne under control - I am on tret now for anti-aging reasons (full routine below) and to keep my skin clear.\n\nI think the culprit is Vanicream gentle facial cleanser. I recently started using it after my bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Foaming Cleanser ran out. I wanted something more hydrating for the winter. The Cetaphil was fine- it felt cleansing because of the foam and did not break me out. I've read such good things about Vanicream so wanted to try it \n\n**My question is, of the ingredients in Vanicream, which would be most likely to cause a cystic acne breakout?** Are there any that are known to cause breakouts for certain people? I would like to avoid this happening again in the future and am only starting to learn which ingredients suit my skin and which don't. I also can't use any vitamin c serums because I get breakouts. If it helps, my dermatologist a few years ago told me I have seb derm and mild rosacea (both much better now!)\n\nThe ingredients are: Purified water, glycerin, coco-glucoside, sodium cocoyl glycinate, acrylates copolymer, caprylyl glycol, mica, sodium chloride, 1,2-hexanediol, titanium dioxide, sodium hydroxide, disodium EDTA.\n\nCurrent Routine: I have been using tret since feb of this year through curology- my current prescription is tret .04% clindamycin 1% and AZA 7%. (Before that, I was using epiduo forte, finacea foam (AZA 15%), and nutraseb through prescriptions from my derm but I lost my insurance so I switched to Curology and it's kept my skin clear.) I use Elta MD UV Clear for SPF over First Aid Beauty  Ultra Repair Face Moisturizer. Sometimes I use First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream on my face when it's really dry (I try to avoid it because its not non-Comedogenic!)\n\nThank you for any guidance!!!",

I can’t figure it out - I’ve never had a reaction like this before and this products seems so gentle!! Anyone experience this with this sunscreen? \n\nDerm said it definitely looked like allergic dermatitis and it went away with hydrocortisone and benedryl.

There is an extract in it that is also called Gooseberry extract (Physalis Angulata Extract) - could that be it? \n\nAny insights are much appreciated. I initially really liked this sunscreen b/c it is so hydrating, so it’s not about the company or anything - I just don’t want to buy any other products with the offending ingredient if I can isolate it. \n\nHere are the\nInactive Ingredients: Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Squalane, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Methyl Dihydroabietate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetyl Palmitate, Coco-Glucoside, Ethyl Ferulate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Lecithin, Bisabolol, Physalis Angulata Extract, Xanthan Gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Sodium Gluconate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\nThanks, all!",

I did not have a full blown allergic reaction, but the burning was so intense it took a while for my skin barrier to recover. I looked like I had a sunburn for several days.\n\nIf you’ve used other mineral sunscreens in the past without problem, I doubt that is your allergen. \n\nI’m theory Physalis Angulata Extract is supposed to be a skin soothing antioxidant (only a few studies) but that doesn’t mean it could not be an allergen for you. \n\nI’ve cross-checked every ingredient in the sunscreen against anything I’ve ever had a reaction to, and I can’t find a culprit.\n\nI’ll be curious to hear what others say as well. I’m so sorry that happened to you. I hope someone else has more insight than I do.\n\nEdit to add: Have you ever reacted to ferulic acid? Ethyl Ferulate is an ester of ferulic acid and ethyl alcohol. Again, this ester is supposed to be a skin soother. But I know my skin does not like ferulic acid.",

    "body": "**Long Post Warning**\n\nI am a bit confused as to what is going on with my hair. For context, I recently moved 3 months ago. The water is soft according to the test strip, but the water for this area is labeled as moderately hard. My previous residence was labeled very hard but read as soft with a test strip (city water, not the very hard well water). I am biracial (African-American/Caucasian-mentioned just in case that makes a difference hair-wise) and have a significant enough vision impairment that I tend to go by feel with my hair since I cannot see it well. If anything seems confusing, please feel free to ask me to ellaborate.\n\nBackground is labeled below, as are pictures (apologies for blurriness), if that would be helpful. Most recently, I have thought that my hair was lacking in protein because it feels dry-when-wet, sandpaper-when-dry, is frizz city, barely holds curl if at all; I did a wash with a homemade gelatin mix. That did not improve anything, so I went the high moisture route thinking that might be the issue. The high-moisture right is what I have been doing for the last 2 weeks since I have read that too much moisture can cause some of these symptoms. I have been using Aveeno Almond Oil Blend shampoo/conditioner. This has not seemed to help the problems. Tonight, I tried a protein treatment (HASK: Keratin Protein, used half, let sit for an hour wrapped in shower cap+towel, rinsed). My thinking was that perhaps the professional-grade vs. homemade was the problem with the first protein wash. My hair feels even frizzier than it has been with no difference in texture that I can tell beyond that.\n\n**Background**\n\nMy has always dried super quickly (since I was a child); literally, I can watch the front start to dry before I leave the restroom after my shower. However, despite spending most of my life with dry hair and a dandruff-ridden scalp that was itchy, I finally found a solution last year.\n\nAt that point, I had been using VO5 Elvine Smooth Intense shampoo/conditioner. A few months before that, i was using OGX Refreshing scalp+Teatree mint shampoo/conditioner. Neither seemed to help the problems. The same dry-when-wet, sandpaper-when-dry, frizzy hair. So, I decided to just go all-natural. I found someone on Etsy who made and sold a shampoo bar that was made out of beef tallow. It was a godsend for my hair....it made my hair feel light, soft, manageable, wet-when-wet, moisturized-when-dry, bouncy curls. It did not feel heavy on my hair either. She stopped having time to make the bars to sell, so I bought another tallow bar from someone else. It made my hair feel just the opposite. It never felt clean, too-wet-when-wet, greased rubber-when-dry, curls were present but limp and scraggly.\n\nFound a shampoo bar by 100Senses after that. The ingredients of that bar are below. Most importantly, it did wonders for my hair like that first tallow bar. Now, after moving 3 months ago, this bar is no longer working. It not working seemed to occur from the moment that I moved here, but there could have been something I did not notice previously if it was gradual. My hair is not back to being itchy or dandruff-prone, but it is dry-when-wet, sandpaper-when-dry, barely holds curl and the curl it does seem to hold is limp, a frizzy mess.\n\nI have only used an ACV rinse with all of the bar products. 2 Tbsp ACV with 8 oz water.\n\n100Senses bar ingredients:   A proprietary and moisturizing blend of sodium cocoyl isethionate (derived from coconut oil), stearic acid (from cocoa butter and shea butter), coconut fatty acid, coco glucoside, water/aqua/eau, argania spinosa (argan) kernel oil, panthenol (pro-vitamin b5), camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract (antioxidants), sucrose cocoate, aloe vera, glycerin, sodium\n\nI am just kind of at a loss at this point in terms of figuring out what the problem is, so I thought you all might have a better idea with all of the collective experience in this group.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: No itchy scalp or dandruff. Also, hair does not feel oily; the sheen in the picture is from the lighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Back](https://preview.redd.it/f05e26oa4mi71.jpg?width=434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b411d9d9c840134427ea4a9e4fda0cc1ef67d78)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Front Side](https://preview.redd.it/8asc4vrf4mi71.jpg?width=499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7925536ac40a3404688817d7d61ab06429d58c4a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Front](https://preview.redd.it/ezqfpmwi4mi71.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ed63df6212f93abf4e5957a9fd073da45a27323)",

    "body": "Hair Care History:  \nI have been using low-sulfate silicone-free shower gels as shampoo for a couple of months already while not using any conditioner. I only restarted using conditioner last Tuesday, because I finally found a 'cone-free conditioner. I can go almost a week without needing to wash my hair, is that a good sign?   \nMy sister has been using high-sulfate shampoos containing a bunch of 'cones, occasionally shampoos containing keratin as well, and accompanying conditioners. I think she might need a few more shampoo washes to get out all of the build-up out of her hair, but I'd love some advice here!  \n  \nHair Properties:  \nI was born with a full head of wavy/soft curl hair and have had waves and/or brushed out curls ever since my hair was long enough to be brushed. I always thought my hair was super frizzy, because it looked so unkempt after all the brushing I did. I found a kind of routine to keep it manageable: brushing while it was still damp after a shower would help form flatter and larger waves, so it would stay closer to my head.  \nI think my curl pattern right now is about 2b, but I think I might have some 2c potential, looking at some of my new-found curls. My hair is somewhere between medium and fine. The strands are somewhat thin, but they aren't brittle and my hair holds shape pretty well if I don't mess with it. I don't think it's very porous. I did the [Slip'n'Slide test](http://www.naturallycurly.com/texture-typing/hair-porosity) and that went about as smoothly going up as going down. My hair is medium-long, going a bit past shoulder length.  \nMy sister was born with curly hair, but has lost those curls by constantly brushing them out. She has what I think are a lot of flyaways on the top of her head, probably in part caused by curl-unfriendly hair cutting techniques. My sister has had her hair thinned out in the past, which I think is mostly cutting certain strands of hair shorter than others with the goal to remove volume. But I think in her case it had an opposite effect, the shortest hairs have the most curl and now they stand away from her head. What kind of styling product would she need to deal with these flyaways? There could also be some frizz involved.  \nMy sister's curl pattern is closer to 3a/b if you give her hair a chance to curl. Before CG it looked more like 2a. Her hair likes to form medium-sized ringlets. I think her hair is somewhat coarse, it is very thick and she has a lot of hair. Her hair holds shape better than mine, if she twists her hair into a ringlet with her fingers it will stay in that shape for hours. Her hair is very long, slightly past bra band length. Her hair feels more porous than mine doing the same test, but I’m not sure how to distinguish between medium and high porosity. Her hair is very dry. She has a lot of split ends and is probably in desperate need of a hair cut, but I'm not sure if that's wise to do now that we're adjusting our routines. Advice?  \n  \nCurrent Routine:  \n*Shampoo * : Sanex Advanced Dermo Repair (this is technically a shower gel)  \nIngredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Chloride, Glyceryl Oleate, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Polyquaternium-7, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Zinc Sulfate, Benzoic Acid.   \n*Conditioner * : Argan Care conditioner  \nIngredients: Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool.  \nI’m planning on running all these ingredients through the ingredient list of Tightly Curly, but if there’s something in these products that shouldn’t be in our hair, please let me know!  \n  \nWe used these products on Tuesday, combed our hair with a wide tooth comb after applying a lot of conditioner. Afterwards plopping it with a T-shirt and sleeping with our hair up in pineapple.  \n  \nI have also attempted  a deep treatment using 100% pure coconut oil on Wednesday. After application with a hair paint brush (is there a specific name for these things?) we let it sit under a shower cap and towel for an hour, then applied a bunch of conditioner and combed it through. Then rinsing it out in the shower using shampoo and conditioner, combed again. My sister plopped for 30-60 minutes, I think? And slept with a pineapple. I showered really late, so I slept with T-shirt plopping overnight (only 6,5 hours of sleep).  \n  \nResults?:  \nIt’s kinda hard to say what product did what, but this method is really working for me so far. Having curls is an immediate boost of confidence for me, because it feels like my hair is finally starting to look how it’s supposed to look. The problem is that I’m constantly playing with my curls. I’ll twist them around my fingers, or pull on them to see them bounce. I think I lost quite some definition today because of this. Is there any way to get some of this definition back for second-day curls? Would it help if I scrunch in some water and/or conditioner and/or coconut oil?  \nMy sister had some mixed results. She has more wavish curls, but her hair came out very greasy on Thursday morning. I think she might not have rinsed everything out properly (long hair is a lot of hair), but I was also thinking about some other causes: Is this because of previous buildup? Should she attempt co-washing about every other day until it improves? It seems that washing with the shampoo could be a little harsh to do it so often, but it might be more effective?  \n  \nI would also like to have some advice on dealing with the weather. We live in the Netherlands and basically go everywhere by bicycle, so our hair is exposed to rain, fog and humidity quite often. My hair will attract the moisture and frizz. I’m not sure how much my sister’s hair is affected by it, because I find it difficult to distinguish frizz from curly flyaways. Are there any styling products we could use to help deal with this?  \n  \n[Pics!]( http://imgur.com/a/8Rnpj)  \n  \nAnd my final question!: How are we doing so far?  \n  \nTL;DR: Just started CG.  \nMy hair: medium-long, medium-fine, low-porosity, 2b-ish curls. How can I hold on to curl definition for 2nd day curls or bring the definition back? How can I combat weather-induced frizz?  \nMy sister’s hair: long and thick, coarse, more porous, 3a/b? curls. Only recently stopped using silicones and sulfates, how to ease the transition. Possibly still has some build-up, attempt co-washing more often? Has a lot of flyaways and probably also some frizz, advice on styling product? Needs a haircut, do it now or wait for routine to set in?  \nWe live in the Netherlands and this will influence product options available to us.  \n  \nSorry for the long post, I just wanted to share my excitement!",

        "body": "I agree with the previous poster, shower gel isn't shampoo, and it has a very harsh sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate. You should probably invest in a few restorative products, like a deep conditioner and protein treatment. Also, be careful with oils. They can be a wonderful thing, but can easily weigh down your hair, especially if you're low-porosity. \n\nFrizz has always been a problem of mine, and there's not that much to do other than use products based on dew points(Link in sidebar) and use gel. \n\nWhen you're just starting out, it will take time for your hair to adjust. I know this seems like a lot of terminology and work, but just keep trying new things, read the posts on naturallycurly.com and you'll get the hang of it in no time.",

    "body": "Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash\n\nIt’s not right...but it’s okay…\n\nThe Ursa Major brand is one that I came across a few times at Ulta but never really gave it a second look. But, after seeing their amazing photos on Instagram and looking into the brand story a bit more I was very intrigued. \n\nThis Vermont based skincare line is focused around a more outdoors/active kind of aesthetic...they really put an emphasis on “less is more” as well. Cleanse, tone, and hydrate are pretty much all you get from their offerings (which is not a bad thing at all).\n\nEvery beautiful mountain landscape pic from Ursa Major just called to my personal love of hiking, rock climbing, and simply being outside. So, without reading too much into the formulations I took the dive with their Fantastic Face Wash. \n\nBut now looking back...I wish I would have used my brain instead of my heart and researched more deeply (I guess not even that deep...turn the bottle around Anthony!).\n\nI did initially really enjoy using this product. The slightly watery cleansing gel/fluid applied to my skin very nicely. Even though this is a low pH cleanser...the later that I was able to create was quite dense and luxurious (especially with my whip maker). Using it with the Foreo Luna 3 also created a fairly dense foam.\n\nIn addition, the wonderful woodsy/bright aroma that the Fantastic Face Wash provides had me quickly falling in love. The scent immediately reminded me of the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Cleansing Foam that I adored (now discontinued). But...it’s this forest wonderland-like scent that ended up being this product’s downfall (for me).\n\nRather than using synthetic fragrance...the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash uses a whole host of essential/fragrant oils. Black Spruce, Fir, Rosemary, Lime, Lemon, Grapefruit, Cedar, Vetiver, and Spearmint Oils all make an appearance here. \n\nDuring the first week/few uses I didn’t see any negative reactions to this product...and for me that was so good to see. “Okay Anthony...you aren’t seeing the typical sensitivity this time around. Maybe the warnings about essential oils you are seeing everywhere aren’t as big of a deal.” I thought to myself.  \n\nBut soon enough...I started to notice little flashes of redness, the occasional angry blemish, or odd warmth on my skin popping up. By week three, my skin started to make it apparent that something was wrong. \n\nI decided to work the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash out of my routine in favor of something that I have used in the past (the 23.5n Rice Soothing Cleansing Foam) and my skin seemed to quickly calm down and several blemishes began to recede. I have been using some awesome soothing products in my routine (reviews coming soon) and they just seemed to immediately feel more effective. It was like the rest of my routine had less to work against to provide a benefit.\n\nSo, I think three weeks is enough for me when it comes to this cleanser. I really, really wanted to like it and be one of the few that truly can put nearly anything on their face LOL! But...the trend has been that products using a large amount of essential oils (specifically citrus oils) have a tendency to anger my skin.\n\nA lavender oil here, or a small amount of rosemary there seem to be okay...but there really is a tipping point for me and the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash pushed things a bit too far. It will however make an excellent body wash!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice\\*, aqua/water/eau, lauryl glucoside, coco-glucoside, sodium cocoyl glutamate, caprylyl/capryl glucoside, inulin, glyceryl laurate, sodium lauroamphoacetate, gluconolactone, sodium lauroyl glutamate, xylitylglucoside, anhydroxylitol, xylitol, oryza sativa (rice) extract\\*, camellia sinensis leaf extract\\*, saccharum officinarum (sugarcane) extract, citrus limon (lemon) fruit oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) fruit extract, vaccinium myrtillus fruit extract, acer saccharum (sugar maple) extract, picea mariana leaf oil\\*, pseudotsuga menziesii branch/leaf oil\\*, rosmarinus officinalis leaf water, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) flower water\\*, citrus paradisi peel oil, citrus aurantifolia peel oil, artemisia ludoviciana (owyhee) leaf oil, juniperus virginiana wood oil, tanacetum annuum flower oil, nardostachys jatamansi oil, vetiveria zizanoides root oil, mentha spicata leaf extract, sodium phytate, PCA glyceryl oleate, citric acid, calcium gluconate, leuconostoc ferment filtrate, sodium benzoate, soybean peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, limonene \\*Denotes organic\n\nWhere To Buy (Ulta $28.00 USD - 236 ML): [https://www.ulta.com/fantastic-face-wash?productId=pimprod2017694](https://www.ulta.com/fantastic-face-wash?productId=pimprod2017694) \n\nOne Thing To Note:\n\nThere are so, so, so many things that can potentially cause sensitivity/irritation. You may find this product to be absolutely amazing and if so...I’m jealous. My reasoning for pointing to the fragrance here is just trial and error/looking at what has caused a problem for my skin in the past. The common theme has been an overabundance of essential oils...especially lemon and orange oil. Let me know if you spot anything else here that stands out as a potential trigger. On the flip side, I don’t think I can recall my skin reacting to a product that uses a low amount of synthetic fragrance...but time will tell.",

        "body": "I had a very similar experience! I've been wanting to find more natural options & this one checked off so many boxes: All natural, made in the USA, cruelty free, simple approach/routine...I've also been trying to find a moisturizer with more \"oomph\" for the winter. Given that they're based in VT, I thought they might be a good choice. \n\nI, too, usually have to avoid any fragrance but convinced myself this would be OK because it's all natural.\n\nTried the Fortifying Face Balm & the Fantastic Face Wash & basically realized very quickly I should have gone with my head instead of heart.\n\nFace Balm:  Very little went a long way in terms of coverage. I didn't find it very moisturizing overall. But, I'm used to a heavier feeling moisturizing cream & this was a nice, light gel, so I decided to keep trying it thinking maybe I just needed to get used to the lighter weight. Also, I had been having some more redness than usual & Ursa Major said this would calm skin (among other things) & several ingredients were listed as soothing\n\nFace Wash: Loved the scent & the feel of the wash. It felt very cleansing & pleasant without being drying\n\nHOWEVER\n\nOne week of the Balm & my face was redder than before. I could see a line of where I had applied the balm (not near my eyes) & where I hadn't.\n\nOnly tried the Face Wash 3 times over the course of the week. I was worried about trying both at once & not being able to tell which one worked/didn't work but temptation got the better of me & I tried both those few times. My skin was *not* happy. Somehow even redder with the combo. It would fade after maybe half hour so, but it would overall by redder than normal.\n\nI gave up after a week & am now trying to figure out how to calm my skin back down.\n\nSuper bummed because I really wanted to like this product line. I think it could work for people with less sensitive skin.\n\nI do appreciate that they offer good sample/travel size options so at least I'm not feeling guilty over throwing out a ton of product.",

I make sure to get an even layer of Product across my entire face and neck while gently massaging got 1-3 minutes. Then, I thoroughly rinse with warm water.\n\nWhy I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Well, as with Glow Recipe...I kind of love Peach & Lily. I have come to really appreciate the work Alicia Yoon and her Team do to create really well formulated Products. So, when this Gel Cleanser was announced...I clicked “Order” the second I could LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that, I was intrigued by the claims that this Cleanser is very soothing and calming as well as being an excellent Cleanser.\n\nOverall Review: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I honestly hadn’t done much research into this Product before plunking down my credit card...it was from Peach & Lily...and I had to have it LOL! So, I didn’t know quite what to expect when I got it into my Routine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The thing that was most apparent (and at the time most worrisome) upon my initial application of this Gel Cleanser was the lack of lather. Don’t get me wrong, this Product does lather A BIT...but to me it felt and applied like some kind of Cleanser/Serum hybrid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The consistency of the Product felt a lot more slippery than I expected, so rather than “scrubbing” my Skin...my hands just slid around my face LOL! It’s hard to describe...but there was certainly a different feeling when using this Power Calm Gel Cleanser. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After the first few uses I was honestly a bit shocked by how well this Product was able to gently cleanse my Skin. I’ve been so used to Foaming Cleanser (pH Balanced of course)...and using this just didn’t seem like it would be enough for my Normal/Combination Skin. But there I was, with Skin feeling super clean yet soft and hydrated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Before I continue...lets talk about the Formula. Camellia Flower Extract, Tea Tree Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Matricaria Flower Extract, Licorice Root Extract, Panthenol, Cucumber Fruit Extract, Peach Fruit Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Aloe Leaf Juice Powder, and Rosemary Leaf Extract all make it fairly high on the Ingredients List. Also, several forms of Hyaluronic Acid are included.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* My biggest feeling of skepticism came from the calming and soothing claims for this Gel Cleanser...but after only a couple of weeks I had to set those aside. This Cleanser really did offer some noticeable calming effects to me Skin not only over time...but pretty much immediately after each use. I found myself relying on this Product post Physical Exfoliation or extractions to just calm everything down (I would Oil Cleanse…so my Exfoliation…then come back in with the Power Calm).  \n\nFor me, this Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser was a one-two punch of an incredibly gentle texture/Application with a soothing/calming/hydrating result. Alicia Yoon describes her Products as being great for all Skin Types...but formulated with her own super sensitive and eczema prone Skin in mind. And I think this Gel Cleanser embodies that more than anything else from the Line (at this point). \n\nFor those with super Oily/Combination Skin...I’m not going to say that this Cleanser will be sufficient for daily use just by itself. I really think and Oil Cleansing Step will be needed in the evening...and possibly even then you might need something a little more powerful. \n\nBut, for those with Drier Skin that need hydration from each and every step in your Routine...I think this is an excellent choice. This Gel Cleanser wont strip or remove anything that it shouldn’t...but rather the Glycerin and Sodium Hyaluronate will impart some watery hydration that you can lock in with a Moisturizer.\n\nAlso, those with Sensitive Skin that are having trouble finding the ideal Cleanser...I would absolutely point you in this direction. I am still not an expert in gentle Cleansers by any means...but this one from Peach & Lily is just so calming and soothing to me. It really helped to reduce redness when I needed it most.\n\nFinally, I know there are a number of people that have tried the “Water Only” Method in the morning in place of a Cleanser...and things didn’t work out (myself included). But on the flip side...some Cleansers can be too drying to use twice a day. I think the Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser would be an amazing option for those that need something gentle/light in the morning!\n\nNow you might be thinking...”Okay Anthony sounds like you found your new HG Cleanser right?”. Well, as far as what’s inside the tube...I think so. It really did blow my mind and make me rethink what an effective Cleanser should look/feel like. But, that plastic tube will keep me from repurchasing this Product time and time again (for now). \n\nI have a couple of Cleansers that promise to be gentle yet effective in my Stash...and they come in glass/resuable bottles. It’s just something that I am trying to lean towards. However, if I cant replicate the success of this Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser...I’ll most likely come back to it eventually. Plastic can be recycled...but I would prefer glass if I can have it LOL!\n\nAs for others, I absolutely would recommend this gem of a Cleanser...especially to those with Sensitive and/or Dry Skin. Another knock out Product from Peach & Lily and I cannot wait to see what they come up with next!\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nDI Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Coco-Glucoside, Tea-Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Citrate, Butylene Glycol, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Panthenol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Cellulose Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pantolactone, Chlorphenesin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyglyceryl-10 Caprylate/Caprate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3h3dud459p41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b30ae67fcf53732a8132a8b658336a12215b88a1",

        "body": "I don't think the LUSH items are \" pure skin poison\". While some people have been shown to have a lot of sensitivity to essential oils, the lavender water and rose water in the toner are pretty benign and I actually really enjoy the moisturizer. If you don't have sensitivity to any of the ingredients, it doesn't hurt to use them. You could replace them once they're used up, but no need to toss them and get new. Maybe go a few days without one or the other and see if your redness goes away. \n\n\nThe first thing I would change is the cleanser. A low pH cleanser will be less stripping and help with any dryness/ dehydration you might have. CeraVe moisturizing wash is at a good pH. If you want to splurge, Fresh Soy Face Cleanser is a really great one. If you're willing to do asian products, Chuusi is a canadian seller that sells the CosRX Low pH cleanser. It's sold out right now, but it should be restocked soon and it's around $12 CAD. \n\nIf you are dealing with texture, you may want to start with a gentle exfoliant. Because you do have sensitivity, I would not suggest the Stridex that is so popular here. I also have somewhat sensitive skin, and Paula's Choice products have irritated my skin in the past. I love the First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance pads, but a cheaper option would be Alpha Hydrox AHA products. Using those 1x/week at the beginning should help deal with the texture around your nose. Don't use acids more than that until you have used them for some time- a major mistake is over-exfoliating and it can really mess up your skin.\n\nDepending on your other concerns, I think it would be nice to add in a hydrating serum. I really love First Aid Beauty for sensitive skin- while I have not used it myself, their Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum has pretty good ingredients. Another option would be a mask- something soothing to help with sensitivity and redness. I love the Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel mask. It helps control my redness and I can leave it on overnight.\n\nHopefully that's helpful :) If you have any questions feel free to ask. In the future, you can also post in the daily help thread for more simple routine help!",

While that’s not a bad thing, it might not be the best option for your needs. \n\nIf you’re looking for something with more coverage from glossier, the flex concealer is dewy and medium to full coverage. You could use that to spot conceal your rosacea if it’s only in a few areas. \n\nIf you still want that no-makeup look, I would recommend something with slightly more coverage like a tinted moisturizer or cc cream. I swear by the first aid beauty tinted moisturizer, but it can be a bit pricey. Something with even more coverage but still gives that natural finish is the MAC face and body foundation- it’s a bit expensive as well, but it lasts for a really long time and has a similar formula to the glossier tint. \n\nHope this helped!",

For lye there's 2 to choose from-Potassium Hydroxide is what gives those soaps a softer final product, and Sodium Hydroxide which makes a harder soap. For your fats there's tons to choose from, but over the years soapers have figured out Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid impart the qualities that shavers desire, a smooth, dense, creamy lather. Tallow and butters like Kokum, Mango seed have the most stearic acid, however straight stearic acid (which is 99% of the time actually a 50/50 mix of stearic and palmitic acid) has tons of benefits in immediately raising the Stearic/palmitic numbers and allowing for soapers to add other beneficial ingredients (like shea and other exotic fats) without sacrificing the qualities we value . Coconut oil (cocos nucifera) is ubiquitous for its bubble formation, it doesn't take a bunch, especially for shave soap. Too much and it can be drying or stripping on your skin which is why it's always further down from anything containing stearic acid.\n\nI'd say you're probably allergic or sensitive to a fragrance, maybe all of them.\n\n  \nI'm surprised sodium cocoate is the number 1 ingredient in SV, a famously excellent soap. I never would have guessed it to be honest, as a soaper I try to limit the coconut oil to the lowest I can.",

    "body": "Hello SCA! I hope all of you are doing well!\n\nHaving an NC35 skin tone, finding a physical sunscreen that doesn't make me look like a ghost is hard. \n\nI generally want Zinc Oxide as an ingredient because it tends to hold up fairly well in comparison to chemical ingredients and for the most part, I don't want to reapply sunscreen.   \n\nThe past 2 years, I have been using my Jack Black Sun Guard SPF 45 and was incredibly impressed by it's \"blend-ability\" because it had Zinc Oxide in it. But, because Zinc Oxide is only really effective against UVA at 20%, I felt that my Jack Black sunscreen faltered because it only had 8%. \n\nI was looking online to find a good physical sunscreen that was affordable, had the right amount of Zinc and didn't have a white cast. Researching was tricky however I came across an article by The Skincare Edit that recommended a list of sunscreens and ultimately decided to get the Rocky Mountain Soap and Co. sunscreen because it has a bit of tint on it. \n\n[This](https://imgur.com/UXbXWjZ) is what it looks like.\n\nOrdered it from [their website](https://www.rockymountainsoap.com/products/natural-sunscreen) on Monday, it shipped from Canada yesterday, and arrived today. \n\n_______\n\nI was able to use it all day today and my overall impression is as follows:\n\n**Price:**\n\n* $17.95 + $5.24 in Shipping = $23.19 in Total, which isn't too bad for me. I pay $23 in total for my Jack Black sunscreen so paying an extra 19 cents is worth the extra UVA protection. \n\n**Ordering:**\n\n* Easy. The website looked credible and secure. I used my debit to buy it and no suspicious activity showed up on bank account thus far. I'm pretty neurotic when it comes to ordering things online, y'know with the whole identity theft and what not. Usually if a site looks shady, and I can't find a place where I can physically pick it up in-store, I end up not buying it. Plus, I hate sending things by mail and waiting a few days to see the refund show up on my account. Considering that it is shipping from Canada, and I live in Los Angeles, I received my order pretty fast. \n\n\n**Application:**\n\n* Very hard to spread. The cream smells like vanilla + coconut and there is some beige tint to it. The sunscreen is very very thick, so I really need to work that stuff onto my skin for it to blend nicely. It looked like it was bunching up at one point, but I kept rubbing it in until it spread evenly, taking a total of approximately 2 minutes for it to look nice. I waited 5 minutes for the sunscreen to set before moving onto doing other things. I applied some onto my neck and forearms, and I still feel there is a \"pastey,\" yet powdery finish, though I think this is standard for mineral sunscreens.\n\n\n**Wear:** \n\n* I personally cannot see any sort of graying on my face when I look in the mirror, and I asked my mom if she noticed anything and she didn't. BUT, in pictures that I took in natural light, I see a ting of graying, though I'm not sure if it's the camera that's picking up flashback. I'm not comfortable in posting my picture online, but if you want to see what it looks like on me, PM me and I'll upload some selfies onto my burner IG and you can take a look. I don't wear foundation, but I do use a little bit of concealer and translucent powder over my sunscreen. There is some shine, but that doesn't bug me because I really like having a dewy finish :D \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* I'm copying and pasting off of their website\n\n>Medicinal ingredients: Zinc Oxide 20.1% \n>Non-Medicinal Ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Isostearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Aqua, >Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Glycerin (organic), Coco-Glucoside, Arachidyl >Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Natural Vanilla Flavour/Aroma, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea >Butter organic), Hectorite, Natural Coconut Flavour/Aroma, Xanthan Gum. \n\n_____\n\nIf there are other things you're curious about, then let me know and I'll reply back!",

decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

So why shouldn't it feel like something you actually look forward to?\n\nPlenty of cleansers can get the job done when it comes to removing dirt, sweat, oil, sunscreen, and leftover skincare. But finding one that cleans thoroughly *without* leaving your skin tight, dry, or irritated? That’s the real challenge. Even tougher is finding one that makes the whole process feel like a small act of self-care instead of a rushed routine.\n\nOver the past five months, we’ve been on a mission to find just that. We tested over 20 facial cleansers, and narrowed it all down to five standouts. These are the ones that lather up beautifully, rinse clean, and leave your skin feeling fresh, not fragile.\n\nWhether your skin is dry, oily, sensitive, acne-prone, or somewhere in between, there’s a cleanser here that deserves a permanent spot by your sink.\n\n### 1.

As it’s massaged into the skin, the formula transforms into a soft, frothy lather that gently cleanses while offering a subtle polishing effect. The texture strikes a rare balance—noticeably exfoliating but still mild enough for regular use.\n\nThe exfoliating action comes from finely milled rice powder, which offers a much gentler alternative to harsh physical scrubs like apricot kernels or walnut shells. The formula provides just enough grit to lightly buff the skin without causing irritation, making it suitable for those looking to smooth texture or boost radiance without risking over-exfoliation.\n\nThough the cleanser is among the most expensive in its category, typically priced around $10 per ounce, only a small amount is needed per use. Using too much can lead to a thick, gritty application that requires extra effort to rinse off, but with the right amount, it creates a creamy, sudsy cleanse that feels both effective and luxurious.\n\nThe scent is another distinguishing feature. While the formula doesn’t include synthetic fragrance, it does contain natural perfuming agents like tea extracts. The resulting aroma is clean and invigorating, though some may find it strong or reminiscent of a clinical spa environment. Those sensitive to fragrance should be aware that the scent is noticeable throughout use.\n\nDespite its gentle formula overall, this cleanser may not be ideal for very sensitive eyes. The light exfoliation and strong scent could be irritating for some, especially when used around the eye area. Additionally, it doesn’t fully remove heavy makeup, so those who wear eyeliner or mascara may need to use a separate remover beforehand.\n\nOverall, Tatcha’s The Rice Wash is a premium cleanser that offers a refined, gently exfoliating experience with a sensorial finish. Its soft grit and rich lather provide a polished cleanse, making it a worthwhile pick for those who prioritize texture, performance, and a little luxury in their routine.\n\n### 2. [EltaMD Skin Recovery Amino Acid Foaming Cleanser](https://productbible.com/product/eltamd-foaming-cleanser)\n\nEltaMD Skin Recovery Amino Acid Foaming Cleanser dispenses as a soft, cloud-like foam that feels light and airy in the hand. Despite its frothy texture, it’s exceptionally gentle, even around the eyes, and leaves skin feeling both clean and nourished.\n\nThis all-foam formula offers an effective cleanse without the harshness often associated with foaming cleansers. It is sulfate-free and removes dirt, oil, and grime thoroughly without stripping the skin. The formula includes ingredients that support the skin barrier, such as vitamin E and amino acids like taurine and glycine, which contribute to its soothing, non-irritating feel.\n\nThe foam maintains its structure during use, giving a consistent and cushiony texture throughout cleansing. This makes it feel more substantial than many other foaming products that tend to break down or disappear quickly upon application. The pump dispenses a precise amount of product—just enough for a full-face wash—making it convenient to use daily.\n\nHowever, there are a few considerations. The cleanser contains 28 ingredients, which could make it harder to pinpoint the cause if irritation occurs. It’s also relatively expensive at around $35, a notable jump from more budget-friendly options like Vanicream. While the formula is fragrance-free, it does have a subtle scent that resembles a blend of medicinal and coconut-like notes. Lastly, the packaging, though functional, is plastic and may feel less premium compared to similarly priced cleansers in glass or more polished containers.\n\nEven with these drawbacks, the EltaMD cleanser remains a standout for those seeking a foaming formula that delivers both effectiveness and gentleness.\n\n### 3. [CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser](https://productbible.com/product/cerave-foaming-cleanser)\n\nCeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser stood out among several options from the brand, earning high marks for its airy texture and effective oil-removing performance. While CeraVe offers a wide range of facial cleansers, this particular formula delivered the best balance between cleansing power and skin comfort.\n\nDesigned to remove excess oil and surface debris, the formula does so without stripping the skin of essential moisture. Traditional cleansers often remove both harmful sebum and beneficial lipids, but this cleanser incorporates moisturizing ingredients like niacinamide, ceramides, and hyaluronic acid to help support the skin barrier while cleansing.\n\nIts texture is a notable highlight. Just a small amount of water turns the gel into a soft, dense foam, creating a satisfying lather that spreads easily across the skin. Among the formulas tested, this one produced some of the most robust bubbles, making the cleansing process feel thorough yet gentle.\n\nAlthough not specifically marketed as a makeup remover, the cleanser effectively breaks down foundation, sunscreen, and even mascara. However, reactions around the eyes varied. While some users found it non-irritating, others experienced mild sensitivity, particularly if the product accidentally entered the eye during use.\n\nOne detail worth noting is the scent. While the formula contains no added fragrance, it does have a faint chemical smell that some users found unappealing. Still, for its cleansing performance, skin-friendly ingredients, and generous lather, CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser remains a reliable and well-rounded option for daily use.\n\n### 4. [La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser](https://productbible.com/product/la-roche-posay-toleraine-cleanser)\n\nLa Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser is a strong choice for those with dry or sensitive skin, offering a gentle cleanse without disrupting the skin's moisture balance. Despite its mildness, it effectively removes impurities without leaving the skin feeling tight or stripped.\n\nThe formula includes 19 ingredients, eight of which are specifically selected to support hydration. These include glycerin, niacinamide, ceramides, vitamin E, and panthenol—all known for their ability to nourish and protect the skin barrier. This makes the cleanser well-suited for daily use, particularly for skin types prone to dryness or sensitivity.\n\nIts texture falls somewhere between a gel, lotion, and cream, offering a consistency that feels substantial without being greasy or sticky. When mixed with water, the cleanser produces a light froth that spreads smoothly and rinses off easily, whether used at the sink or in the shower. It holds well to the skin during application, creating a cleansing experience that feels controlled and effective.\n\nPackaging adds to the product’s appeal. The pump bottle is practical, especially when washing with wet hands, and the brand also offers refill pouches at a lower price, which is a convenient and sustainable option.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that the formula leans more functional than luxurious. It is fragrance-free and produces minimal lather, which may feel less indulgent for those who prefer a more sensory or spa-like experience. For users seeking a cleanser that combines gentle performance with a rich scent and foam, alternatives like Tatcha’s The Rice Wash may be a better fit.\n\nEven so, La Roche-Posay’s cleanser remains a dependable, well-formulated option for dry skin that prioritizes skin health and simplicity.\n\n### 5. [Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser](https://productbible.com/product/vanicream-cleanser)\n\nVanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser is a simple, budget-friendly option that delivers effective results without irritating sensitive skin. Its mild liquid-to-foam formula removes dirt, oil, and residue while keeping the skin comfortable and hydrated. There’s no tightness, dryness, or redness afterward—just a clean, fresh feel.\n\nWith only 12 ingredients, this fragrance-free and sulfate-free formula is impressively minimalist. One of its key ingredients, coco glucoside, is a gentle cleansing agent derived from coconut oil and sugar. While some other cleansers use fewer ingredients overall, they often place their active cleansers further down the list. In comparison, Vanicream balances simplicity and performance well, offering a thorough cleanse without stripping the skin.\n\nThe cleanser lathers easily, transforming from a pearly liquid into a soft foam with just a small amount of water. Many sensitive-skin products tend to feel more like lotion and require extra effort to work into a lather, but Vanicream delivers a more satisfying and efficient cleansing experience.\n\nIt also offers strong value. A single 8-ounce bottle, typically priced around nine dollars, lasts for months with twice-daily use. This makes it a cost-effective choice that competes with far more expensive products in terms of quality and longevity.\n\nThe packaging is functional and travel-friendly. The pump locks securely with a simple quarter turn, avoiding spills and messes when packing or storing the bottle.\n\nOne detail to note is that the cleanser’s pearlescent appearance comes from mica, an ingredient that can occasionally trigger sensitivity in some individuals. However, it is generally well-tolerated and unlikely to cause issues for most users.",

(sometimes, I have the feeling it will only end with the inevitable decline in testosterone that awaits us all, but I digress...)\n\nFor the last 2 months, I've been religiously doing **NOTHING** about my skin.  \n\\- Sleeping in the same dirty pillowcase (y, gross...)  \n\\- No moisturizer, toner, active, clay mask or whatever.  \n\\- Only using the same BODY cleanser to wash my face once a day and that's it.  \n\n\nThese are the ingredients in the body cleanser I used (**Douche Soin Corine de Farme KIDS 2en1 Corps & Cheveux**) : *Aqua, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glycerin, Parfum, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Citric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Extract\\*, Viola Tricolor Extract\\*.*  \n\n\nDespite this one being marketed toward kids, it made my 28 yo skin tight, dry and flaky even on the first use. No surprise there, as it happens with every cleanser (even the most gentle ones) if I don't moisturize afterward.  \n\n\nRESULT : **not a single pimple in 2 months.** Skin would get dry and flaky, then oily... and that's it.  \nI'd gladly keep this weird new routine, but fine lines started to show more as a side effect of dryness. So I started to moisturize again 2 days ago (LRP Toleriane Sensitive Cream) and... pimples are back.  \n\n\n**TLDR ; What would be the more minimalist, simplest moisturizer to avoid breaking out ? I've read about Sebamed Gel and ordered it but it looks loaded to me (12 ingredients, Propylene glycol, Vit B5...)**  \n\n\nPure squalene oil, The ordinary HA + moisturizing, aquaphor are already out of the equation. Dimethicone / panthenol are also out.  \n\n\nThanks for reading and answering :)",

    "body": "I know there are a few bleach related posts here but I wanted to find out if my specific situation is cause for alarm, my apologies if I shouldn't be posting this.\n\nOkay so I'm housesitting for a friend, and just noticed that the fabric softener dispener in their washing machine had mould in it. I'd been using the machine for a couple of weeks so theoretically it hasn't been harmful, but I sort of have a phobia/hatred for mould and things that can grow, spread and become bigger issues, so I got to cleaning. \n\nI haven't been independent for long so I'm still learning a lot of important household maintenance, so I Googled \"How to clean a fabric softener dispenser\" and found this:\n\n[https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Fabric-Softener-Dispenser](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Fabric-Softener-Dispenser)\n\nNow if you scroll down to the 'Cleaning the Dispenser Manually' section, it says:\n\n \"In a large bowl or a bucket, create a solution of 1 gallon (3.78 liters) warm water, ¼ cup (2 ounces) of liquid dish detergent, and 1 cup (8 ounces) of bleach.\"\n\nSo I did this. We'll return to this point a bit later but I'll continue from here. I got a bucket (the only bucket in the house believe it or not), poured in water, dish detergent and bleach approximately following the above ratio and it honestly seemed ok, it got soapy and (understandably) smelt a bit chemical-ish, but seems like nothing too horrible (I don't know how bleach smells on its own because I kept my face well away from it). So I started cleaning the removable part of the fabric softener dispenser, with gloves on and keeping my face turned away as much as possible, and then saw the floor getting wet. Turns out the only bucket in the house has a crack in the bottom, so I quickly moved it into the laundry sink, but at least the dispenser was perfecly clean.\n\nSo now I had some bleachy-detergenty water on the floor, so I dried it all up with some paper towels. In the meantime, I moved onto the \"Cleaning a Non-removable Dispenser\" section because there was grime and mould in the other parts of the fabric softener mechanism. So I poured in dish detergent and water into the dispenser, and added a little bit of bleach because the mixture was so effective before. Now I also had some laundry powder in the machine which I forgot about because I was going to clean some clothes before I noticed this mould. I then put the machine on hot and the longest rinse cycle to give it a good clean (hopefully). So to quickly reiterate, I deviated from the instructions slightly and had: dish detergent, a small amount of bleach and a small capful of laundry powder.\n\nI then looked back to the floor where that mixture leaked earlier and thought I should clean it more or rinse it with water because walking on bleached floor would be bad for your skin. So I grabbed the closest water I could see which was a spray bottle of approximately 70% water and 30% vinegar (all the cleaning supplies are right next to where I was). After I started spraying, I quickly remembered reading that vinegar and bleach is an extremely dangerous combination, so I left the room,  opened all the doors and windows with a towel over my face, grabbed my phone and laptop and went upstairs which brings me to this point of anxiously reading things and becoming concerned about my stupid errors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've read that important information would be the dish detergent used, as some contain ammonia or ammonia-derived compounds (I'm not sure what those would be called). So I used this, and it's worth mentioning that it doesn't say anywhere on the labels not to mix it with bleach, which apparently all detergents with ammonia are supposed to:\n\n[https://naturesorganics.com.au/product/earth-choice-lemon-fresh-dishwash-liquid/](https://naturesorganics.com.au/product/earth-choice-lemon-fresh-dishwash-liquid/)\n\nand here's the ingredient list:\n\nWater - Purified (Solvent)\n\nSodium Laureth Sulfate\\* (Cleaning agent)\n\nSodium Chloride (Viscosity control)\n\nCoco-Glucoside\\* (Cleaning agent)\n\nCocamidopropyl Betaine\\* (Cleaning agent)\n\nCocamine Oxide \\* (Foam Booster)\n\nFragrance (Perfume)\n\nBenzisothiazolinone (Preservative)\n\nCitric Acid\\* (pH buffering)\n\nCaramel\\* (Colouring agent)\n\n(\\*Indicates derived from plant ingredients)\n\nUnfortunately I'm not sure what the laundry powder is yet because it's in an unmarked tub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've read some scary things like bleach mixed with certain chemicals can create an invisible or odourless gas (can't remember which) that can give you brain damage.\n\nThis is obviously a very scary prospect, so I'd like to know if I need to be concerned or see someone, and also if I destroyed the washing machine.\n\n1. My main source of exposure was a bucket of water, bleach and dish detergent with the ingredients and ratios above in this post. My face was around 0.5 metres/a couple of feet away for maybe a couple of minutes and I was turned away from it for half of this time, but I was also in the same room within a few metres/less than 10 feet of the bucket for around 10-15 minutes maximum. \n\n2. I also sprayed some diluted vinegar and water on some diluted water+bleach+dish detergent solution that leaked on the floor and then left the room very quickly after that.\n\n3. The washing machine had dish detergent, a small amount of bleach and a small amount of standard laundry powder. It did a long hot cycle, and after that was done I've since gone back into the room with a towel over my mouth and started a long cold rinse cycle, but didn't look inside or open the machine, then left immediately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring all this, I didn't notice any intense fumes other than a sort of chlorine-ish smell (I just looked it up and apparently bleach and chlorine smell somewhat similar), my eyes didn't sting, my lungs/chest may have burnt slightly after the fact but I may just be stressing/panicking. I can breathe deeply with no issues right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help and advice is massively appreciated, thanks so much.",

Acid exfoliants need time to penetrate the skin in order to do their work.\n\nTo purchase acid exfoliants in the UK, you can try Paula's Choice UK (expensive), Forever Young Active Solutions (cheap), or Nip + Fab (mid-range), which is available in Boots and Superdrug.\n\nI use Korean products as I find they suit my skin best and are pretty good value: CosRX Blackhead Power Liquid for BHA and Whitehead Power Liquid for AHA (this is quite strong and not necessarily for beginners). They are around £7 each for around 3 months of product. There's a lot of info over on /r/AsianBeauty.\n\nIf you worry about sunlight, do you wear a high factor sunscreen every day? This is important regardless, but if you do start using acids it's absolutely essential. Asian sunscreens are believed to be higher quality in terms of sun protection, and sit more nicely on the skin than Western products. I use Biore Watery Essence, which is SPF 50+ PA++++, and you can buy it from Ebay and Amazon UK for around £7-10.\n\nPIH (acne scarring) can potentially be helped to heal with a Vitamin C serum, but honestly, sunscreen is your bff in the fight against scarring, at least to start with.\n\nWe sound like similar skin types, so feel free to ask me anything else! This is my routine, which is keeping my hormonal acne under control.

I used the All Bright serum (see AHA/ BHA mega review in the sidebar) and was underwhelmed.\n\nFurthermore the UV index is pretty low at present, low enough not to be useful for vitamin D production in the skin. I would be more concerned about getting enough bioavailable vitamin D in your diet since that and the long chain omega-3s also in oily fish are really important for skin health. Experts recommend up to four servings of oily fish a week.\n\nConsult your family doctor about the breakouts because the most effective acne fighting actives are on prescription.

All the products I use and review here are completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus, etc ). So here we go: \n\n**BEST**: \n\n1. **Acne.org cleanser**: this is my HG face cleanser that I have repurchased so many times. No matter how many products I try over the years, I always come back to this because it’s cost effective, works well without drying out my skin, and does not leave a residue behind. It has a gel texture and come in a pump bottle which make it super convenient to use. \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Disodium Cocamphodiacetate, Butylene Glycol, Sage Extract, Cucumber Extract, White Oak Bark Extract, Panthenol, Allantoin, Acrylates Copolymer, Methylgluceth-20, Polysorbate-20, Quaternium-15, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Face Cleanser:** This cleanser is one of my recent discovery and I like it a lot. It’s a little more pricey than the [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) cleanser, but it works well and is gentle on the skin. It comes in a tube which makes it convenient for travel. \n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Coconut Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Stearyl Alcohol, Allantoin,  Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium PCA, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Maltodextrin,  Tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Soon Jung pH 5.5 Foam Cleanser:** This is a Korean product. It comes in a tube and does cleanse well, doesn’t over dry, and leaves no residue behind. Overall, this is a good cleanser. If you are looking for a good Korean water based cleanser, I would recommend this one. This would be best for people with normal to oily skin, IMO.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Coco -betaine, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Madecassoside\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WORST**: \n\n1. **Hada Labo Goku-jyun Foaming Face Wash:** This is probably the worse cleanser out of everything I tried in a long time. I decided to purchase this product to try because I like the oil cleanser from Hada Labo, but this one is a total let down! This cleanser come in a pump bottle, which makes it easy to dispense the product, but that’s the only pro. Now the cons: This foam cleanser does not cleanse well. For me, It’s too gentle on the skin, leave a greasy residue on my skin and made me break out. I believe the greasy feeling is due to the Vaseline in the formula. I think this cleanser will only work for people with dry to very dry skin, but even if you have dry skin, there are so many other better cleansers out there. Those of you with oily, acne-prone or combo skin, this product will be a disaster! So stay away!\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, BG, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, PEG-8, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium Taurine Cocoyl Methyltaurate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate(Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), **Vaseline**, Citric Acid, Polyquaternium-7, EDTA-2Na, BHT, Methylparaben\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SO-SO:**\n\n1. **Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser:** This is another Korean product. It comes in a pump bottle and is very convenient to use. However, this is a very average cleanser. It’s not the worst, but not the best either. It works and is gentle on the skin, but there’s nothing wow worthy about it. Also, there’s nothing it does that the other cleansers I mention above cannot do. I won’t be repurchasing this one. \n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola) Extract, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Protease, Leucine, Alanine, Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Proline, Valine, Isoleucine, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Histidine, Cysteine, Methionine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Benzoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate",

None of these leave my skin dry or tight. \n\n* **Simple Hydrating Cleansing Oil** - this is very nice for such a cheap product. My HG until I tried out fancier stuff. For drier and dehydrated skin that isn't acne prone, you could use this as a single cleanse. I have all winter. \n\n* **Clinique Take The Day Off Balm** - I got this as a sample pot and it's really cosmetically elegant. Lathers up beautifully. Very satisfying to use. Single cleanse works for me. \n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Radiance cleansing balm** - this is so fancy! Unlike the Clinique, it turns straight to an oil texture when you rub it in. I prefer that the Clinique is a slightly thicker texture when you rub it in personally but I'm trying a fermented skincare routine which is why I bought it. The packaging is amazing - it comes with a spatula in a little compartment in the lid! I'm not sure it emulsifies as well as the Clinique so I double cleanse my T-zone to be safe. \n\n* **Simple Refreshing Gel face wash** - very nice, good second cleanser. Cheap but effective. Also Fungal Acne safe according Folliculitis Scout but please check yourself. I use this as my second cleanser on my T-zone and my sole cleanser on my neck/upper chest.",

I'm hoping to reduce the appearance of my SFs, reduce red patches around my face (between eyebrows, around nose, and rosey cheeks) and avoid getting (more?) fine lines. I've got freckles from when I was a kid, and I'm a bit over them, too. Wall of text incoming!\n\nMy skin, if left on its own, is quite flakey, and dry, but I end up with a flakey and oily nose (I figure it gets oily to compensate for being dry. I drink lots of water, and eat plenty of veggies. I'm very careful about sunscreen if I'm going outside for more than 10 minutes.   \n\nI think it would be worth using something more in terms of moisturiser - I'm just not sure what!

The oil cleanse would also remove makeup, but would help with the SFs.\n\nThen I would add something that's more humectant before the occlusive moisturizer - maybe a hyaluronic acid serum? The Baji mist has sodium hyaluronate which should work similarly, so for now you could use that more often if you're not using it every day.\n\nAnd maybe bump up the Cleanance K to every other day?",

And since your cleanser is made for babies, and the first surfactant is the gentle cocamidopropyl betaine, maybe it just doesn't cleanse well enough for you? \"Gentle\" is typically good, but when it comes to cleansers when you have skin that clogs easily, you might need something more thorough.

    "body": "Hello!  \nI wanted to share my progress being into the curly girl method for 2 months. I wanted to make this post mostly of the Amla powder results that I had. Unfortunately my first Amla application formed even better curls but I failed to take pics, so those pics are after a month and it seems that my hair continues to form them. Sometimes they make strong curls and other times very lose.\n\nHair type: High Porosity Hair, forming 2B up to 3A curls, color treated, and 6 months ago bleached.  \nSo this is why I invested heavily as you will read below in many products to see what works for me.  \nBecause I have white hair, I have to dye them.  \nMy choice is Eko hair dye from Exclusive (perhaps the best copper red I have ever had in my life) Passion and Color line. Its an organic hair dye.\n\nProducts:  \nCurl activators as masks, 1-3 times per week. (still figuring out a good program)\n\n1. Amla powder (2 spoons at a ball, little warm water to make a watery paste, apply on hair and leave it for an hour) Amla is the biggest curl activator for me and my type of hair out of any other expensive product that I use (see below about Olaplex 3 and Bond Rehab by Curlsmith)\n2. Olaplex 3, the first 2 times I didn't notice major difference, but the third time I left it for an 1.5 hours and my hair formed almost like the amla nice waves/curls, so I believe it works and for bleached hair it might take sometime.\n3. Bond Rehub by Curlsmith, to be honest no major difference after 2 applications. But because I bought 3 on black friday big discount I will use them all!\n\nShampoo:  \nI have 2 main choices after my experiments with Rhassoul which was a disaster, my hair type doesn't like clays, oh well my face does, so nothing goes to waste.\n\n1. Organic shampoo base from europe with only those ingredients  *Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\\*\\*, Decyl Glucoside\\*, Lauryl Glucoside\\*, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid* (I will add some goodies in there but not sure yet what)\n2. Oat Water! To my surprise oat water is amazing! I read the info from here [https://thebeautybrains.com/2016/06/can-i-use-clay-to-shampoo-my-hair-episode-136/?fbclid=IwY2xjawHGSTRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHdrKS1uRFh4\\_G0-vcgtRpyUHzKvYtN4cD4FEO6\\_WU-undlxtyQ9mn8fJ8g\\_aem\\_jwYOR\\_6Q4rvyWFYToZbwfg](https://thebeautybrains.com/2016/06/can-i-use-clay-to-shampoo-my-hair-episode-136/?fbclid=IwY2xjawHGSTRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHdrKS1uRFh4_G0-vcgtRpyUHzKvYtN4cD4FEO6_WU-undlxtyQ9mn8fJ8g_aem_jwYOR_6Q4rvyWFYToZbwfg)\n\nso, I bought organic oats whole, (not powder, please don't use powder, disaster results according to some reddits), I boiled a good amount of oats (to make it concetrated) for 2 min to release natural saponins and left it for about an hour at the hot water to cool down. Used a strainer and voila! Oat water, doesn't bubble but it does clean the hair, use conditioner after and my hair were sooooo soft.  \nI highly recommend oat water when someone doesn't use heavy products, for curly girl method its amazing for some people.  \nOats contain two unique steroidal saponins, avenacoside A, 1, and avenacoside B, 2.  \nPoint is works! Especially for people who chose to shampoo more than once per week like me.  \nBUT once per week I would use regular shampoo curly girl approved.  \nAnd most importantly it might be color safe for people like me who use copper hair dyes and its a pain in the a\\*\\*\\* that color.\n\nConditioner:\n\n1. Organic conditioner base from EU with those ingredients *Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Alcohol\\*, Betaine, Coco-glucoside\\*, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter\\*\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\\*\\*, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil\\*\\*, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Xanthan Gum, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Citric Acid, Tocopherol*\n\n(again this is a base for making your own conditioner I will add some things not sure yet what)\n\n2. Garnier Fructis Keratin Hair Bomb MASK  \nIf someone search the ingredients they are Curly girl approved BUT it doesn't contain keratin, it contains a 3 hydrolyzed proteins combo that seems benefit the hair a lot!  \nSoy, wheat and corn hydrolyzed proteins and I indeed see difference at my curls.\n\nStyling products:  \nCurly Angels brand\n\nHallelujah curl activator  \nCurling Mousse  \nGlorious Curling Gel  \nI am highly satisfied with those, I cannot say Curlsmith is better or not, at least at my hair.\n\nCurlsmith  \nHydrate and Plump leave in (it works, it gives volume)  \nWeightless air dry cream (I guess it works, not major difference than the curly angels brand)  \nHydro Style Flexi Jelly (it works good, I prefer the Glorious Curling Gel, it leaves the hair softer)  \nCurl Defining styling soufflé, (same as above, they all work, but if I put too much they dry the hair a bit to the touch)\n\nMoroccanoil brand:  \nMoroccanoil uses one ingredient which is great for hair VEGEPRO! which is this:  \nHydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol  \nThis works, this is why at my first post I said in 7 days my hair transformed, I was using them every day.  \nBUT they contain silicons and I wanted to go full proper curly girl method, I can actually buy Vegepro and make a solution much cheaper to be honest. No need to pay such expensive hair line for one ingredient that you can find cheap.\n\nSo basically I discontinued the moroccanoil and I will use all the above.  \nThe only rule I don't follow for the curly girl method is washing my hair once per week. I wash my hair more often, Im not convinced about the water/oil science to be honest, and I have to use those below for my high porosity hair because any hair dyes leave my hair faster than an athlete running at 100 meters.  \nSo my plan is to use diluted ACV vinegar rinse and coconut oil that closes the hair scales before any wash.  \nI am figuring out a proper weekly method, now its a bit chaotic.  \nso here are my pics and my progress.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyhmeswgb76e1.jpg?width=1453&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=463969bf83917cd495ab09dfe5d996fee696ec60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2sxmj0xgb76e1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62f5eb163ee6709d370571cc774ebeefe26d9a00\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g49gaaxgb76e1.jpg?width=1298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca3127549a3a322d31b08be134813d8eb7dc5b94\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xi8a7pxgb76e1.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d54357ff5f2c87314f30a5c28e8fa8ae8173703b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41ipxqxgb76e1.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13382c8a43236537ad8cbe2983139aa518d42a45\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xruzqvygb76e1.jpg?width=1286&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d4a45ee941a207d726990b51f0cc336bf0229a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uqwv08ygb76e1.jpg?width=1196&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deedc539c31cbce9cc4add4d26a46b8e0428dc57\n\nThis picture with the white roots is early days, 2 months ago when I first saw 3A curl, one single curl, Im so happy! This is how it all started to get more serious about this method. AND I had my very first complement at the street from a lady if those are my natural hair! and I proudly said YES!!!!!!!\n\nNo finger coiling, I leave them all natural and wild to see how they behave.  \nIn the future I might start finger coiling them to enhance the result.  \nSo, this is what I had and my progress.

    "body": "For those familiar with Sephora, they pass out \"gifts\" in your birthday month. This year I received a bottle of Peter Thomas Roth Anti-aging Cleanser and an accompanying jar of Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel Mask. Having spent some time on this sub, I've learned to be very careful what I use on my face. As one with very sensitive skin, I'm on a constant hunt for products that won't be over drying and don't contain cetyl alcohol. These new additions to my curio cabinet of skin care experiments seem so enticing. They smell fantastic. I patch test both the Cleanser and the Mask and they felt awesome....but so did the lemon and baking soda wash I used once upon an ignorant time, before I learned how bad it was for my skin over time. Does anyone have advice concerning these products or their ingredients? \n\ntl&dr: Peter Thomas Roth Cleanser and ~~PTR Cucumber mask~~, a good idea or a really bad one?\n\n\n*edit product ingredient lists: \n\n\n**PTR AntiAging Cleansing Gel** Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Salicylic Acid (Beta Hydroxy Acid), Glycolic Acid/Arginine, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Quercus Alba Extract (White Oak Bark), Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Fruit Extract, Tilia Cordata (Linden) Flower Extract, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Citric Acid, Citrus Bioflavonoids, Allantoin, Methylparaben, Quaternium-15, Red 40, Yellow 5, Fragrance\n\n**PTR Cucumber Gel Mask** Water (Aqua), Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate, Isocetyl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol (eeep, well, that answers my question about this product, it's a no go for me!)**, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Propylene Glycol Stearate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate, Methylheptyl Isostearate, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide 19, Dipeptide Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate, Palmitoyl Dipeptide-5 Diaminobutyroyl Hydroxythreonine, Palmitoyl Dipeptide-5 Diaminohydroxybutyrate Isohexadecane, Retinyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phospholipids, Butylene Glycol, Triolein, Lecithin, Phytosteryl Canola Glycerides, Linoleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Acrylates Copolymer, Dextran, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phenoxyethanol\n\n\n",

I can't find the thread now, but I know I read about it on here in the context of red/irritated skin, and that it really helps to calm/cool.  If you have sensitive skin, I think it would be a great product to use when your skin is flaring up (though I would do some more small patch tests to make sure you react okay).\n\nIt would be helpful if you would post or link to the ingredients.\n\nEdit: grammar",

So I've been looking into soap/syndet? bars as an alternative. The Cerave hydrating bar soap has good reviews but it isn't available in my country so I was looking at the Isana med soap as an alternative. It looks promising so I wanted to know if anyone else has used it or any other bar soap for their face? \n\nHere's the ingredients for the Isana soap:\n\n Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch, Cetearyl Alcohol, Paraffin, Aqua, Citirc Acid, Parfum, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Bisabolol, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide.

        "body": "Coconut oil's fatty acid contend is around 50% lauric acid, so sodium coco-sulfate (the syndet formed from coconut oil) is composed of ~ 50%  sodium lauryl sulfate, aka SLS. It's not the harshest detergent out there (better than traditional soaps at least) but it's still often too stripping for many people's face. If you already know you have an easily triggered skin, maybe you shouldn't take the risk with this one.\n\nEdit: if you have noticed you always react to cocoglucosides, it's probably worth getting a dr's test for a coconut allergy. If it is positive than avoid all coconut derivatives in your products",

The bifesta cleanser has none of those ingredients and made my skin so smooth but now that i’m in europe (italy) I can’t find a cleanser without either of these ingredients!!! PLEASE help.
