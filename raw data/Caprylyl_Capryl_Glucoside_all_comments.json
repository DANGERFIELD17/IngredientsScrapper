    "body": "I’m 24 and I have sensitive/combo/acne prone skin. When I first met my dermatologist, he made me understand that I was doing too much and that I had a compromised skin barrier. He explained that a stinging sensation when you apply your moisturizer can be an indicator as well as random episodes of redness and breakouts. He also offered for me to go on birth control for my acne which I didn’t want to do. *(Scroll under my routine for my derm’s advice).*          \n            \nWent back in to see my dermatologist recently for a checkup and he was really impressed by my progress and said that my skin looked the best he’d seen it!!!        \n            \n           \n** My skincare routine:**        \n           \nAM:          \n1. Room temperature water rinse.      \n2. **Brandefy: Clinical Vit C + E + Ferulic Defend Serum** (dupe of skinceuticals).     \n3. **Murmure: Microflora cream** (prebiotics and probiotics).     \n4. **Innis free: Daily UV Defense Sunscreen spf 36** (no white cast, no pilling).      \n                 \nPM:           \n1. **The Ordinary: Glucoside Cleanser** (gentle surfactants).       \n2. **Dr Dennis Gross: Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel** (once a week).      \n3. **Murmure: Microflora cream** (prebiotics & probiotics).      \n4.  **A313: Vitamin A Pommade** (every other day / Retinyl Palmitate is a gentle retinoid).      \n       \n           \n**What my dermatologist advised me to do:**        \n        \n- Apply the Epiduo he prescribed 3 times a week and slowly work towards applying it every day (stopped after a couple weeks because my skin was peeling like crazy and felt like it was on fire).      \n       \n- Limit the exfoliating to max once a week (the skin already exfoliates itself naturally once a month).      \n       \n- Switch out my cleanser for a more gentle one like the Vanicream gentle cleanser or the Ordinary glucoside cleanser. And experiment with cleansing your face only in the evening.       \n       \n           \n**Having struggled for a while with my skin and being a bit of a geek, I did a lot of research and want to share what I learned:**       \n       \n- Retinoids thicken the dermis but they thin out the stratum corneum (where the skin microbiome lives)         \n        \n- The quality of the diet is very important because gut health has a huge impact on your skin’s health.      \n       \n- Non-ionic surfactants are usually gentler (look for: Coco Glucoside, Decyl Glucoside, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside…).      \n        \n- Try topical prebiotics and probiotics to support your skin barrier (both are important to work).       \n       \n- Look out for potential photosensitizing, poreclogging and irritating ingredients (that’s a whole post in itself).",

I'm also currently working on restoring my moisture barrier and I'm using ceramides, occlusives, oils, sunscreen and a gentle cleanser. I noticed that you continued to use actives whilst you worked on restoring yours, more specifically vitamin C. Did this not affect/hinder your recovery? I have some Skinceuticals sitting in my fridge (The one with Phloretin) and I'd love to continue using it before it oxidises, but every piece I've literature I've read states that vitamin C must be avoided whilst the skin barrier is compromised.\n\nIs there a way I can safely incorporate this back into my routine? I'd also like to restart using my retinol, but I'm not sure how to do this safely. My barrier is the best it's ever been and I don't want to sabotage my progress.",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

It also comes in a Lavender version but I because I think that one is made with lavender essential oils, the pure rosewater and glycerin is better for your skin. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you'd say the Garnier rosewater spray is a great setting spray? Lol I'm looking for a cheaper setting spray so I'd like your full review haha",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "As the title suggests, this is my current sunscreen collection, and I'll be reviewing the products and mentioning the ones I love and the ones I don't ! (This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Sun Essence SPF 50+ PA++++\n\nI’ll try to keep cool about this one...but I am truly in love with this sunscreen.\n\nThe Keep Cool Bamboo line is something thai have dabbled in before (the lotion from the line was kind of a “just okay” product for me). But, the Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Sun Essence has been so impressive.\n\nFeaturing a spf factor of 50+ PA++++ this is a high protection sunscreen that feels nearly weightless. Bamboo water, niacinamide, centella asiatica extract, and several forms of hyaluronic acid pair with the chemical filters to offer a sunscreen that reads more like a soothing moisturizer. \n\nIn practice...I have found this sunscreen to apply and layer beautifully while staying put a bit better than other lightweight spf products I have used in the past (looking at you Purito). I was able to hike for miles and miles while reapplying this product without any issues of greasy-ness, pilling, or migrating to my eye area.\n\nThe lack of fragrance/fragrant oils makes this a sunscreen that just kind of melts into the background...no irritation or lingering scent (at least for me).\n\nAs for the claims of soothing/calming...I didn’t really see too much in the way of that. However, I felt the same about the Keep Cool Soothe Lotion. Maybe the power of bamboo is a bit lost on me lol.\n\nEither way, this is an incredible sunscreen for its protection, weightless/unobtrusive application, and ability to “stick” to my skin even during mild physical activity. This product from Keep Cool will really be giving the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence a run for best sunscreen of the year!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Bambusa Vulgaris Water (401,800ppm), Water, Diglycerin, C12-16 Alkyl Benzoate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxylbenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Propanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, BehenylAlcohol, Lespedeza Capitata Leaf/Stem Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Thuja Orientalis Extract, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Polyisobutene, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Silica, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate\n\nWhere To Buy (Amazon - $24.99 USD - 50 ml): [https://www.amazon.com/KEEP-COOL-Protection-Moisturizing-Prescription/dp/B089ZZ7WZR](https://www.amazon.com/KEEP-COOL-Protection-Moisturizing-Prescription/dp/B089ZZ7WZR) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g65kl82kbdr51.jpg?width=2888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd99a379b3552a431113aaa4e37fada21034af85",

Clarify that it is one voucher per sunscreen and Not one voucher per purchase made. \n (This matters as many international buyers got several sunscreen tubes at once in one purchase to save on international shipping costs). \n\n2. When using your voucher there will be no “Maximum one voucher per each purchase at checkout”.\n(This matters because there is usually a minimum to get free shipping in their store that is usually above $120 per purchase, so you would be forced to either buy more stuff with your own money to reach $120 or to pay for international shipping fees yourself, You should be allowed to use all your vouchers at once if you wish as these vouchers should represent the money you paid for their misleading products, many of your purchases were above $25 at once, so why should these vouchers be treated as something different than plain cash). \n\n3. There will be no “Can use one $25 voucher per each purchase of a minimum of $150”. \n(This matters because you would have to pay out of pocket $125 to get your $25 voucher’s worth).\n\n4. There will be no “Other promotions and discounts cannot apply if this voucher is used at checkout”. \n(This matters because it could make your voucher worthless if the store discount was worth more than your $25 voucher, making using your voucher more costly than not using it). \n\nP.S.: They may try to delete your comment on their post, so if many people post this same questions they will be less likely to be able delete them all and ignore our request.

    "body": "Hey all! I see a bunch of comments on here of people looking for hydrating mineral sunscreens, so I figured I'd type up a full review of one of my favorites: **Kinship Self-Reflect Probiotic Moisturizing Sunscreen** (SPF 32). This is an all Zinc-Oxide, non-nano, mineral sunscreen with a creamy silicone-free base that is lightly tinted and gives a dewy, slightly shimmery (NOT GLITTERY) finish. It's very hydrating and soothing, which is a bit unusual for a zinc sunscreen.\n\n**Filters & SPF:** 22.4% Non-Nano Zinc Oxide SPF 32\n\n**Full (inactive) Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coconut Alkanes, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\\*, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Coco-Glucoside, Lactobacillus Ferment, Rubus Idaeus (Red Raspberry) Seed Oil\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Liquid Endosperm, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Rhizomes Oil\\*, Butyrospermum Parkii Nut Extract, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Tocopherol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Isostearic Acid, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sclerotium Gum, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Octyldodecanol, Tapioca Starch, Citric Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, May contain +/- Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492)\n\n**Ingredient Callouts:** Silicone Free, Alcohol-free (contains fatty alcohols), fragrance free (does use Vanilla Planiforia Fruit Extract for scent), Vegan, Cruelty-Free, Reef-Safe (but not waterproof)\n\n**Price & Where to buy:** $25 USD for 50g, Online, direct from Kinship\n\n**About my skin/climate:** I'm 23 and have Rosacea (both generalized Erythema and papules) with very dry skin. I live in a sunny but not warm climate with a fair amount of humidity. I have extremely sensitive skin and can only tolerate mineral filters. Fitzpatrick III (but pale because Rosacea). \n\n**What it looks like on:** [**https://imgur.com/a/l2abDtE**](https://imgur.com/a/l2abDtE)\n\nIt's very hydrating and gives a nice dewy finish. This gives a mild blurring effect and does help disguise my redness. It has a slight shimmer to it, but it's not glittery. The tint is fair, and cool/pink toned. When you initially rub it in, it has a white cast but it settles to match my skin fairly well. If you're darker, the color of the tint and the white cast from a high % Zinc may become a problem. Even on me, I do get some flashback with this one. I would say it's better than most high Zinc non-nano sunscreens. \n\n**Texture/Smell**\n\nThis is a thick, creamy base. It takes a while to dry down and can remain a bit sticky to the touch. I don't find that it transfers, but my hair does occasionally get stuck in it when it's fresh. You do have to rub this is, with the thick consistency it's not one that you can just spread and leave (without looking like a ghost). It doesn't feel too heavy on the skin. \n\nAs far as smell goes, it's actually quite unusual. This one smells completely like Vanilla Cupcakes (though it dissipates fast). I was initially super skeptical of this because I don't like scented products, but I haven't had any irritation from the Vanillin from which the scent derives. I'm generally very, very sensitive to fragrances and it looks like research has it as generally non-irritating, but as always YMMV with these sort of plant extracts. \n\n**Packaging:** Sort of standard tube with plastic twist-off lid. I wish they sold it in larger quantities. It is made of 30% post-consumer materials and they have a recycling program if that's important to you. \n\n**Overall**\n\nThis is a staple of my rotation and one I'm likely to repurchase because of how hydrating and soothing it is and the high zinc percentage. It does have a lot of plant extracts, which could be irritating if you're sensitive to them (always patch-test). On me there's very minimal white-cast and I really like the finish. I think this would be best on dry to normal skin because of how hydrating the product is. I've had no issues with the sun protection (haven't gotten any burns, noticeable new sun-spots, or Rosacea flairs while wearing this). I'd like to see a higher SPF, but honestly there are limits when it comes to an all-mineral formula. It's not waterproof, but doesn't move around a lot if I sweat. \n\n**Other Zinc sunscreens I've reviewed:** [Versed Guards Up Daily Mineral Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/gpzvwy/review_sun_care_versed_guards_up_daily_mineral/)",

(This is not at all sponsored, I paid for my whole shipment, I just wanted to help others out who want to hear about it.)\n\nIt's a mineral sunscreen with 9.4% zinc oxide, unscented, and labeled as \"grease-free and no-clog\". Although I know some people were disappointed that it's not a chemical formula, it was exciting for me to see because my skin is sensitive and reacts to most chemical filters.\n\nThe formula is super lightweight, and rubs in completely clear. I have white but slightly tanned skin, and there is no white cast on my skin at all. (Although I can't vouch for how it would look on darker skin tones.) Personally I've never tried a mineral sunscreen that hasn't left at least a slight white cast on my skin - this one doesn't.\n\nThe formula is originally a bit tacky, but dries down comfortably matte after 1-2 minutes. It's not drying, nor greasy. I can't yet vouch for how well it protects my skin, or if my skin will break out from it, but it's the most comfortable mineral based sunscreen I've tried.\n\nIt's $14 for 1.4 oz, and here are the inactive ingredients: Water, Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Squalane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Extract, Polyester-5, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethyl Ferulate, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Sodium Chloride, Phospholipids, Gluconolactone, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Urea, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nedit: I will say that the pump on the packaging is wonky, only really works at a very specific angle, which is a bit annoying. Although another bonus I forgot to mention, is that I can apply it close to my eyes without any irritation or stinging. ",

I see that Bona also sells [Bona Hard-Surface Floor Cleaner Refill](https://www.bona.com/en-us/products/homeowners/cleaners/hard-surface/stl-hs-clnr-refill-128oz/). The ingredient list is exactly the same:\n\n* Water/Aqua (Solvent), Isopropylideneglycerol (Solvent)\n* Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (Surfactant)\n* Sodium Decylglucoside Hydroxyropylsulfonate (Surfactant)\n* Polymeric Green Colorant (Colorant)\n* Polymeric Yellow Colorant (Colorant)\n* Methylisothiazolinone (Preservative)\n* Benzisothiazolinone (Preservative)\n* Methylchloroisothiazolinone (Preservative)\n* Citric Acid (pH Regulating Agent)\n\nSo seems like they're the same thing in different packaging, right?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nBona also sells [Bona Hard-Surface Floor Cleaner - Machine Formulation](https://www.bona.com/en-us/products/homeowners/machine/bona-hs-floor-clnr-for-machines-64oz/) which is a pH neutral concentrate you add water to &  has a lemon mint scent. It lists the same ingredients as above, but has undisclosed Fragrance as the fifth ingredient and Sodium Bicarbonate (Stabilizer), Limonene (Fragrance Allergen) as the last two ingredients. Limonene is an essential oil.\n\nThey also have one that's not concentrated: [Bona Hard-Surface Floor Cleaner with Lemon Mint](https://www.bona.com/en-us/products/homeowners/cleaners/hard-surface/hs-lemon-mint-clnr-spray-32oz/) which the second & third ingredients are switched, has less fragrance & it doesn't have the limonene. And it's not a concentrate, so it should have more water. Also pH neutral.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nWhat's everyone's thoughts on using these in the Braava? Seems like the Bona Hard-Surface Floor Cleaner Refill is the exact same stuff as what iRobot recommends, so it would be totally fine to use. I think iRobot used to actually recommend that product before the iRobot branded Bona existed, right?\n\nAs for either of the two lemon mint ones, it would be nice to have something with some scent in it. I guess with some of the fragrance being undisclosed, you have no idea what's really in it. Limonene is an essential oil, so idk how that would be for the Braava, but I mean it's in the one made for upright machine mops so if it's not bad for them, it might not be bad for the Braava.\n\nTarget sells the Hard-Surface Floor Cleaner Refill non-concentrated Lemon Mint one & they're always running deals on stuff, so could probably get a good deal on it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit: I contacted Bona to ask if the Bona iRobot Hard-Surface Floor Cleaner and the Bona Hard-Surface Floor Cleaner Refill are the same thing in different packaging. They did not confirm or deny, but they did say they're both approved for the Braava.\n\nThey said that the the Bona Hard-Surface Floor Cleaner - Machine Formulation (which has the lemon mint scent) is NOT approved, but did not say why.",

I’m very happy to have found your review. my current HG sunscreen is biore watery essence which is light so good for summer, you said this watermelon one is very heavy so I might try it for winter now. \n\nQuestion:you said it’s pink tinted so I’m wondering if it gives a bit of tint/glow up/ tone up effect? Hoping it can help me transition out of make up now that my skin is getting clearer and more even.",

    "body": "TL;DR Foaming cleanser with Coco-Glucoside was too stripping. Started experimenting with the emulsion-cream formula (Sodium Polyacrylate, oils, Glycerin, surfactants/solubilizers) – better but still too strong. Got some random papules. Need help with a cleansing formula to make it less stripping but without residue that might contribute to acne. A simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe left a residue, got some papules and one nodule because of it.\n\nDetailed version:\n\nSince simple foaming cleanser with just 2.7% Coco-Glucoside (and less=no foam) was too stripping to my combo (oily-normal-dry) skin I started experimenting with non-foaming emulsion-cream formula.\n\nI used Sodium Polyacrylate (Cosmedia SP) as an emulsifier and thickener. 1-2%, then found that 2 was too much.\n\nI used some surfactants/solubilizers with it, usually Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate at 0.5-5%. 2-5% was too strong. Every time I tried to add Coco-Glucoside (with an additional thickener, like Xanthan Gum), it was too strong, usually, 4 uses and my skin was crying for help. Even with oils, which I describe below.\n\nThen I added some oils, usually caprylic/capric triglyceride or grapeseed oil. 2-5%. Anything below 5% was too strong. I wonder, maybe Cosmedia is just too good at emulsifying sebum on the face. I still want to use it because it feels great at distributing it on a wet face and it's easy to rinse off.\n\nSo it mostly looked something like this:\n\n* 4-5% Oils\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 0.5-2% Surfactants/solubilizers\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* Lactic acid to pH about 6.\n* Then I tried something simple like:\n* 4% Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n\nIt was still a little too strong, but sebum production lowered and my skin calmed down a little.\n\nNext, I tried something like this:\n\n* 2% Grapeseed oil\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 1.1% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 0.85% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 0.5% Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate\n\nToo strong. Added more oils to 5% total. It's better, but my dry areas are still tight (cheeks) and normal areas a little tight. And now I have a problem with 2-5 papules on oily areas (forehead).\n\nSo I'm not sure what could I change and what's causing inflamed pimples – maybe it's still too stripping or it's because of some PEG-7 residue? I read that it's a surfactant AND a refatener.\n\nSpeaking of residues – I tried to make a simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe:\n\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% BTMS-50\n* 2% Cetyl Alcohol\n* 0.5% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* 0.5% Glyceryl Stearate Citrate\n* 0.5% Hydroxyethylcellulose\n\nI used it like 4 times and didn't like it as it left a powdery residue (I think it's a BTMS and/or Cetyl Alcohol?) and I got some papules and one nodule. It was 16 days ago. I read that BTMS can break some people out badly, I wonder if maybe these papules that I've been getting lately was still because of a cleanser with BTMS that I used 4 times 2 weeks ago.\n\nI know it's not a place for acne, but I think it was important to mention it. I think most of my acne is because of just using too stripping cleansers and/or a residue of product.\n\nI am open to suggestions, I can replace Sodium Polyacrylate with something else, but it's hard to get some emulsifiers/solubilizers here in Poland so I'd like to use it.\n\nI use a simple cream after cleansing:\n\n* 5% Dimethicone 350 CST\n* 4% Betaine\n* 2% Sodium Polyacrylate - I think I'll lower it to 1-1.5% because it's a little too thick and it dries too quickly. Or maybe add something like Sorbitol?\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n\nHere's a list of emulsifiers/surfactants/solubilizers (except ingredients which I described above) which I can buy here I Poland:\n\n* Olivem 1000 - I'm afraid a little that it'll contribute to acne, even in a rinse-off product.\n* Creamy Base 1-1-3 *(Aqua, Glycerin, Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Trilaureth-4 phosphate, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin)*\n* Self-emulsifying creamy base *(Glyceryl Stearate Citrate (and) Sucrose Stearate (and) Sucrose Distearate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate (and) Cetyl Alcohol (and) Sodium Ricinoleate)* \\- it contains Fatty Alcohol and I'm not sure if it contributed to acne or it was just BTMS.\n* Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate - the description says it needs to have 15-40% of oils to be stable, so I think it's not a good idea for a cleansing formula.\n* Glyceryl Monostearate - it needs to have pH >6.8\n* SLP *(Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate)*\n* Polysorbate 20, 80, 85\n* *Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate* \\- Again, Fatty Alcohol\n* Simulgel Thickener (Sodium Acrylate / Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer & Isohexadecane & Polysorbate 80) - maybe it would be a better option than just Sodium Polyacrylate\n   * Or this: Emulcold Extra (Sodium Acrylate; Acryloyldimethyl Taurate; Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer; Isohexadecane; Polysorbate 60)\n* Polawax (Emulsifying Wax NF)\n* Gosulin IL *(Isoamyl Laurate & Isoamyl Cocoate) -* not an emulsifier, but I read it can be used to wash off dimethicone easily.\n* Carbomer - I think it can't be used alone to emulsify, but it works well with Sodium Polyacrylamide, so I can use less Cosmedia and lower pH >6 without loss of a viscosity \n* Surfactants:\n   * Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (O110) - I read that it's harsher than Coco-Glucoside.\n   * Decyl Glucoside (O10) - same concerns as above.\n   * Lauryl Glucoside\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids - it's a new ingredient in a shop, I haven't made a research about it yet.\n   * Cocamidopropyl Betaine - I think I'm allergic to amphoteric surfactants or it's because of some of it binds to the skin? My skin is itchy after I use it a couple of days in a row.\n   * Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate - same as above.\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate - a product with it made my hands very dry, so I think I don't want to use it on my face. Which is sad because studies have shown that it's one of the mildest anionics...",

Not sure if you’d be able to find that ingredient in your area. \n\nThe product I got has 25% active surfactant matter, and I use it at 4% in my formula, so the surfactant in the end-product is 1%. \n\nI just used distilled water, a thickener (could be some kind of gum), 0.2% Hyaluronic Acid (instead of glycerin), the SCG (surfactant), and preservative.\n\nIt’s obviously more a gel cleanser than a cream. It doesn’t foam. I just gently massage the gel around my face. It’s enough to get my pores clear. Doesn’t leave any residue. \n\nIf you needed it a bit stronger you could try 5% sodium cococyl glycinate (that’s calculating for a product with 25% active surfactant matter). \n\nAnother thing-  if you want to try a different oil in your formulas, you could try Neossance Squalane (from sugar cane). It is non-irritating and non-acnegenic. Doesn’t have any astringent qualities. Very lightweight but conditioning oil.",

Might also be worth trying without PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate or Sodium Polyacrylate to tell if they are irritating you individually. You can also try a blend of surfactants. Commercial cleansers utilises a mix of surfactants to increase the micelle size and gentleness. Might be worth trying to base your cleanser off a well formulated recipe first then modifying from there too.",

    "body": "I  picked this one up from YesStyle last year looking for an every day  body sunscreen and I have finally finished it! It took me roughly 6 or  so months, my partner and I have used it as our casual sunscreen when  going out for evening runs or a quick errands.\n\nClimate:  Hot and humid, I normally do not wear sunscreen inside but I do have  big windows in my home office so I've been looking for big value  sunscreens to encourage more protection.\n\nSkin type: Combination\n\n**Review: Eunyul cloud mint sun drop fluid spf 50 pa ++++**\n\nWith  the high prices of shipping I was looking for a sunscreen that would  last a while to get the most bang out of my buck and I stumbled across  this one after browsing Yesstyle for any that were over the average 60  ml.\n\nThis is one of the thinnest  sunscreens I've ever tried so if you're big into a sunscreen that  doesn't feel like it's on your skin this might be for you, *but* it has a very apparent and likely high amount of alcohol in its formulation.\n\nIt  does help it absorb really fast on your skin which I loved for my arms  and legs but I could feel it cause dehydration for my face. It would  feel fine on application but throughout the day my face would start to  feel tight even if I layered moisturizer underneath. The smell is also  slightly plastic-like, so after testing it for a month or so trying to  make it work it eventually became my body only sunscreen.\n\n*Packaging*\n\nLove  the color and its visual appeal, can't deny the name and color scheme  caught my attention for its pastel aesthetic. The bottle itself is  plastic and sturdy with a normal pump. The sunscreen is very runny as  you can see from the picture so it can be difficult to control how much  product to dispense. I've accidentally splattered sunscreen on my  clothes or onto the floor when I was running late.\n\nI  almost want to see this formulation in a spray sunscreen form or in  something more travel friendly because of how quick absorbing it is, it  would be great on the go if not for the pump bottle.\n\n*Ingredients*\n\nWater,   Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat.,   1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide,   Polymethyl Methacrylate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl   Triazine, Behenyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Ammonium   Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium   Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene,   Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Adenosine,   Centella Asiatica Extract, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate,   Sodium Hyaluronate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Mentha   Suaveolens Leaf Extract, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Extract,   Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed   Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium   Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate\n\nPros:\n\n\\-Absorbs quickly\n\n\\-Runny, milky texture so great for layering\n\n\\- 297 ml, large bottle, good value for price. At the time it was around $16?\n\n\\-Refreshing and slightly cooling\n\nCons\n\n\\-Too dehydrating for my combination skin, may be better for oily skin types\n\n\\-Pump bottle can be annoying or messy for how thin the sunscreen was\n\n\\-Smell could be better, plastic/glue/alcohol like. I don't mind it but I could see how some may not like it\n\n**TLDR:**  Great value sunscreen but high alcohol content makes this too  dehydrating for the face. If you want a sunscreen that doesn't feel like  it's on your skin, you may like this one. I would recommend for a  casual every day body sunscreen.\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owp9prvv6zt81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75ad1c069c2e79cf925a47023e82f7eba153d16e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vu1p9xvv6zt81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=422287fedfaffaf01f148461d35f21c8ccab6f76\n\n[Runny\\/milky texture](https://preview.redd.it/mgybxcvv6zt81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=904400db676883fac938ce06308ba2c95bb91ad4)",

    "body": "Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Sun Essence SPF 50+ PA++++\n\nI’ll try to keep cool about this one...but I am truly in love with this sunscreen.\n\nThe Keep Cool Bamboo line is something thai have dabbled in before (the lotion from the line was kind of a “just okay” product for me). But, the Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Sun Essence has been so impressive.\n\nFeaturing a spf factor of 50+ PA++++ this is a high protection sunscreen that feels nearly weightless. Bamboo water, niacinamide, centella asiatica extract, and several forms of hyaluronic acid pair with the chemical filters to offer a sunscreen that reads more like a soothing moisturizer. \n\nIn practice...I have found this sunscreen to apply and layer beautifully while staying put a bit better than other lightweight spf products I have used in the past (looking at you Purito). I was able to hike for miles and miles while reapplying this product without any issues of greasy-ness, pilling, or migrating to my eye area.\n\nThe lack of fragrance/fragrant oils makes this a sunscreen that just kind of melts into the background...no irritation or lingering scent (at least for me).\n\nAs for the claims of soothing/calming...I didn’t really see too much in the way of that. However, I felt the same about the Keep Cool Soothe Lotion. Maybe the power of bamboo is a bit lost on me lol.\n\nEither way, this is an incredible sunscreen for its protection, weightless/unobtrusive application, and ability to “stick” to my skin even during mild physical activity. This product from Keep Cool will really be giving the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence a run for best sunscreen of the year!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Bambusa Vulgaris Water (401,800ppm), Water, Diglycerin, C12-16 Alkyl Benzoate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxylbenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Propanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, BehenylAlcohol, Lespedeza Capitata Leaf/Stem Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Thuja Orientalis Extract, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Polyisobutene, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Silica, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate\n\nWhere To Buy (Amazon - $24.99 USD - 50 ml): [https://www.amazon.com/KEEP-COOL-Protection-Moisturizing-Prescription/dp/B089ZZ7WZR](https://www.amazon.com/KEEP-COOL-Protection-Moisturizing-Prescription/dp/B089ZZ7WZR) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zok6mrkbbdr51.jpg?width=2888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8baa4a989b7752585e8e31dcfaff09937e703aaa",

Clarify that it is one voucher per sunscreen and Not one voucher per purchase made. \n (This matters as many international buyers got several sunscreen tubes at once in one purchase to save on international shipping costs). \n\n2. When using your voucher there will be no “Maximum one voucher per each purchase at checkout”.\n(This matters because there is usually a minimum to get free shipping in their store that is usually above $120 per purchase, so you would be forced to either buy more stuff with your own money to reach $120 or to pay for international shipping fees yourself, You should be allowed to use all your vouchers at once if you wish as these vouchers should represent the money you paid for their misleading products, many of your purchases were above $25 at once, so why should these vouchers be treated as something different than plain cash). \n\n3. There will be no “Can use one $25 voucher per each purchase of a minimum of $150”. \n(This matters because you would have to pay out of pocket $125 to get your $25 voucher’s worth).\n\n4. There will be no “Other promotions and discounts cannot apply if this voucher is used at checkout”. \n(This matters because it could make your voucher worthless if the store discount was worth more than your $25 voucher, making using your voucher more costly than not using it). \n\nP.S.: They may try to delete your comment on their post, so if many people post this same questions they will be less likely to be able delete them all and ignore our request. Based on their behavior in the past few weeks, I would not be surprised if they try to delete comments deliberately.",

I can’t figure it out - I’ve never had a reaction like this before and this products seems so gentle!! Anyone experience this with this sunscreen? \n\nDerm said it definitely looked like allergic dermatitis and it went away with hydrocortisone and benedryl. I’ve used other mineral sunscreens before so I don’t think I’m allergic to the zinc or titanium dioxide. There is an extract in it that is also called Gooseberry extract (Physalis Angulata Extract) - could that be it? \n\nAny insights are much appreciated. I initially really liked this sunscreen b/c it is so hydrating, so it’s not about the company or anything - I just don’t want to buy any other products with the offending ingredient if I can isolate it. \n\nHere are the\nInactive Ingredients: Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Squalane, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Methyl Dihydroabietate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetyl Palmitate, Coco-Glucoside, Ethyl Ferulate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Lecithin, Bisabolol, Physalis Angulata Extract, Xanthan Gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Sodium Gluconate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\nThanks, all!",

I did not have a full blown allergic reaction, but the burning was so intense it took a while for my skin barrier to recover. I looked like I had a sunburn for several days.\n\nIf you’ve used other mineral sunscreens in the past without problem, I doubt that is your allergen. \n\nI’m theory Physalis Angulata Extract is supposed to be a skin soothing antioxidant (only a few studies) but that doesn’t mean it could not be an allergen for you. \n\nI’ve cross-checked every ingredient in the sunscreen against anything I’ve ever had a reaction to, and I can’t find a culprit.\n\nI’ll be curious to hear what others say as well. I’m so sorry that happened to you. I hope someone else has more insight than I do.\n\nEdit to add: Have you ever reacted to ferulic acid? Ethyl Ferulate is an ester of ferulic acid and ethyl alcohol. Again, this ester is supposed to be a skin soother. But I know my skin does not like ferulic acid.",

My skin felt like leather and peeled after the swelling went down. 3 days later, it still felt like bugs were crawling on my skin, actively biting me. It was awful. Benadryl didn't help at all.

    "body": "Bellflower Watermelon Fresh Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++\n\nBellflower is a K-Beauty brand that I wasn’t familiar with at all until seeing them pop up on Instagram. Even then, they aren’t mentioned very often.\n\nWhile I wasn’t able to uncover much about the brand...the US site highlights their focus on straightforward formulations without added fragrance or colors. Fair enough…\n\nThe product I was intrigued by on social was their Watermelon Fresh Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++. This chemical sunscreen features watermelon fruit extract and centella asiatica for hydration as well as soothing.\n\nThe baby pink tinted lotion style product applies to skin very well and absorbs with zero white cast. Whereas the Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Sun Essence was rather thin and the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence was a bit thicker...this one from Bellflower is the heaviest of them all.\n\nThis heavier consistency never verges on greasy (this is an oil-free formula) so those with combination/oily skin should still be fine...but I could see this as being better suited for normal to dry skin.\n\nJust like the Keep Cool sunscreen...there is no noticeable scent to speak of. I love how these types of sunscreens just melt into the rest of my routine without any lingering fragrance (but I’ll be honest in saying I was hoping for at least a tiny hint of watermelon).\n\nConsidering the $14.00 USD price, the Watermelon Fresh Sunscreen from Bellflower is an excellent/more affordable option compared to my favorites from Keep Cool and Klairs.\n\nBut, the shipping time of just over a month and slightly heavier lotion may have me going for those others more often than not.\n\nRegardless...this sunscreen ended up being an excellent contender alongside some other awesome products I have tried this year. I’m glad I took the plunge on this indie K-Beauty brand! \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Citrullus Vulgaris (Watermelon) Fruit Extract(11,700 ppm), Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Silica, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Polyisobutene, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Centella Asiatica Extract, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, CI 77491, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\nWhere To Buy (Bellflower Site - $14.00 USD - 50ml): [https://www.bellflowercos.com/store/p13/Bellflower\\_Watermelon\\_Fresh\\_Sunscreen\\_SPF50\\_%2FPA\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_50ml.html#/](https://www.bellflowercos.com/store/p13/Bellflower_Watermelon_Fresh_Sunscreen_SPF50_%2FPA_____50ml.html#/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ogt74sv5vt51.jpg?width=5172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3361ccb8e3575431d83c875329fd7d45a0820841",

    "body": "Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash\n\nIt’s not right...but it’s okay…\n\nThe Ursa Major brand is one that I came across a few times at Ulta but never really gave it a second look. But, after seeing their amazing photos on Instagram and looking into the brand story a bit more I was very intrigued. \n\nThis Vermont based skincare line is focused around a more outdoors/active kind of aesthetic...they really put an emphasis on “less is more” as well. Cleanse, tone, and hydrate are pretty much all you get from their offerings (which is not a bad thing at all).\n\nEvery beautiful mountain landscape pic from Ursa Major just called to my personal love of hiking, rock climbing, and simply being outside. So, without reading too much into the formulations I took the dive with their Fantastic Face Wash. \n\nBut now looking back...I wish I would have used my brain instead of my heart and researched more deeply (I guess not even that deep...turn the bottle around Anthony!).\n\nI did initially really enjoy using this product. The slightly watery cleansing gel/fluid applied to my skin very nicely. Even though this is a low pH cleanser...the later that I was able to create was quite dense and luxurious (especially with my whip maker). Using it with the Foreo Luna 3 also created a fairly dense foam.\n\nIn addition, the wonderful woodsy/bright aroma that the Fantastic Face Wash provides had me quickly falling in love. The scent immediately reminded me of the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Cleansing Foam that I adored (now discontinued). But...it’s this forest wonderland-like scent that ended up being this product’s downfall (for me).\n\nRather than using synthetic fragrance...the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash uses a whole host of essential/fragrant oils. Black Spruce, Fir, Rosemary, Lime, Lemon, Grapefruit, Cedar, Vetiver, and Spearmint Oils all make an appearance here. \n\nDuring the first week/few uses I didn’t see any negative reactions to this product...and for me that was so good to see. “Okay Anthony...you aren’t seeing the typical sensitivity this time around. Maybe the warnings about essential oils you are seeing everywhere aren’t as big of a deal.” I thought to myself.  \n\nBut soon enough...I started to notice little flashes of redness, the occasional angry blemish, or odd warmth on my skin popping up. By week three, my skin started to make it apparent that something was wrong. \n\nI decided to work the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash out of my routine in favor of something that I have used in the past (the 23.5n Rice Soothing Cleansing Foam) and my skin seemed to quickly calm down and several blemishes began to recede. I have been using some awesome soothing products in my routine (reviews coming soon) and they just seemed to immediately feel more effective. It was like the rest of my routine had less to work against to provide a benefit.\n\nSo, I think three weeks is enough for me when it comes to this cleanser. I really, really wanted to like it and be one of the few that truly can put nearly anything on their face LOL! But...the trend has been that products using a large amount of essential oils (specifically citrus oils) have a tendency to anger my skin.\n\nA lavender oil here, or a small amount of rosemary there seem to be okay...but there really is a tipping point for me and the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash pushed things a bit too far. It will however make an excellent body wash!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice\\*, aqua/water/eau, lauryl glucoside, coco-glucoside, sodium cocoyl glutamate, caprylyl/capryl glucoside, inulin, glyceryl laurate, sodium lauroamphoacetate, gluconolactone, sodium lauroyl glutamate, xylitylglucoside, anhydroxylitol, xylitol, oryza sativa (rice) extract\\*, camellia sinensis leaf extract\\*, saccharum officinarum (sugarcane) extract, citrus limon (lemon) fruit oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) fruit extract, vaccinium myrtillus fruit extract, acer saccharum (sugar maple) extract, picea mariana leaf oil\\*, pseudotsuga menziesii branch/leaf oil\\*, rosmarinus officinalis leaf water, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) flower water\\*, citrus paradisi peel oil, citrus aurantifolia peel oil, artemisia ludoviciana (owyhee) leaf oil, juniperus virginiana wood oil, tanacetum annuum flower oil, nardostachys jatamansi oil, vetiveria zizanoides root oil, mentha spicata leaf extract, sodium phytate, PCA glyceryl oleate, citric acid, calcium gluconate, leuconostoc ferment filtrate, sodium benzoate, soybean peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, limonene \\*Denotes organic\n\nWhere To Buy (Ulta $28.00 USD - 236 ML): [https://www.ulta.com/fantastic-face-wash?productId=pimprod2017694](https://www.ulta.com/fantastic-face-wash?productId=pimprod2017694) \n\nOne Thing To Note:\n\nThere are so, so, so many things that can potentially cause sensitivity/irritation. You may find this product to be absolutely amazing and if so...I’m jealous. My reasoning for pointing to the fragrance here is just trial and error/looking at what has caused a problem for my skin in the past. The common theme has been an overabundance of essential oils...especially lemon and orange oil. Let me know if you spot anything else here that stands out as a potential trigger. On the flip side, I don’t think I can recall my skin reacting to a product that uses a low amount of synthetic fragrance...but time will tell.",

I've been wanting to find more natural options & this one checked off so many boxes: All natural, made in the USA, cruelty free, simple approach/routine...I've also been trying to find a moisturizer with more \"oomph\" for the winter. Given that they're based in VT, I thought they might be a good choice. \n\nI, too, usually have to avoid any fragrance but convinced myself this would be OK because it's all natural.\n\nTried the Fortifying Face Balm & the Fantastic Face Wash & basically realized very quickly I should have gone with my head instead of heart.\n\nFace Balm:  Very little went a long way in terms of coverage. I didn't find it very moisturizing overall. But, I'm used to a heavier feeling moisturizing cream & this was a nice, light gel, so I decided to keep trying it thinking maybe I just needed to get used to the lighter weight. Also, I had been having some more redness than usual & Ursa Major said this would calm skin (among other things) & several ingredients were listed as soothing\n\nFace Wash: Loved the scent & the feel of the wash. It felt very cleansing & pleasant without being drying\n\nHOWEVER\n\nOne week of the Balm & my face was redder than before. I could see a line of where I had applied the balm (not near my eyes) & where I hadn't.\n\nOnly tried the Face Wash 3 times over the course of the week. I was worried about trying both at once & not being able to tell which one worked/didn't work but temptation got the better of me & I tried both those few times. My skin was *not* happy. Somehow even redder with the combo. It would fade after maybe half hour so, but it would overall by redder than normal.\n\nI gave up after a week & am now trying to figure out how to calm my skin back down.\n\nSuper bummed because I really wanted to like this product line. I think it could work for people with less sensitive skin.\n\nI do appreciate that they offer good sample/travel size options so at least I'm not feeling guilty over throwing out a ton of product.",

    "body": "Hey, SCA! I posted this in the Daily Questions thread yesterday, but hope I'll get more visibility this way. \n\nIs/was anyone else a fan of the [Skinfix foaming oil cleanser from before their brand overhaul and move to Sephora](https://www.influenster.com/reviews/skinfix-foaming-oil-cleanser-34oz)? This is my absolute favorite second cleanser — I love the super-creamy, rich, dense foam and the barely-there scent, and it leaves my skin feeling so clean but never dry or tight. (I have very dehydrated, combination skin.) But with Skinfix's brand overhaul a year or two ago, it seems they've not only updated the packaging, but [reformulated it as well](https://www.sephora.com/product/barrier-foaming-oil-cleanser-P442836). I've been subsisting on a panic-driven eBay haul of the original version ever since but will soon be down to my last bottle. Sad.\n\nHere are their relative ingredients lists (looks like they mainly took out most of the fruit extracts, which might not be so bad?):\n\n**Original:** Water/Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Panthenol, Betaine, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydrolyzed Chondrus Crispus Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rose Extract, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower/Leaf Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Extract, Rubus Ideaus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n**New (Barrier+) version:** Water/Eau/Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycol Distearate, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Gluconolactone, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Tocopherol, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Coconut Acid, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate.\n\nHas anyone used both versions — or just the new one — and are you willing to share your thoughts? I'll probably end up purchasing the new version anyway, just to try it, but I'd love to have some insight beforehand, if possible! \n(I'd also appreciate any recs for similar cleansers from folks who've used the old one before!)",

        "body": "I use the inkey list product. I purchased it because I could’t deal with the photosensitivity and peeling/burning/redness. I live in Arizona.  I have sensitive skin and this hasn’t broken me out. It has made my lips peel though. I’m not a huge fan of lip balm. \n\nI’ve been using it for almost two months twice a day with nothing else except for Supergoop’s mineral matte tinted sunblock during the daytime. I’m still using the same bottle. I don’t have to use very much. Product is white and has a moisturizer consistency. Spreads easily. Very little smell unlike the very chemical-smells of TO retinol products. It’s easy to get too much product out of the little container. \n\nThis gives me similar results to The Ordinary’s granactive retinoid 2% emulsion that uses an encapsulated form of retinol so it is less irritating. I haven’t gotten any bad photosensitivity from it which is nice unlike retinol. \n\nThis gave me a lot of smoothness like the ordinary’s above mentioned product, but I still haven’t seen a big change in scars. I didn’t see a big change with my scars or discoloration/uneveness with other retinol products. I don’t have wrinkles so I can’t say anything about that. \n\nI wouldn’t say this is enough alone as a moisturizer if you have dry skin. My skin is normal to dry and I’m okay with putting on a second layer in areas that are drier. No greasiness. Absorbed by my skin quickly. I’ll probably have to go back to putting my Saturday skin glacial water cream and or my le prunier plum elixir on in the next few months though. \n\nIt’s really cheap and I like that it gives my skin a poreless look. I think I’ll keep buying it until something nicer comes along without EOs and other irritants.",

    "body": "Beekman 1802 Buttermilk Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm\n\nI think one of the biggest takeaways I have had from trying/testing literal hundreds of skincare products over the past couple of years is that just because a product is an all out miss for me...that doesn’t mean it should be written off by everyone else. \n\nSure...there are products that are just poorly formulated, physically painful to use, or are just nonsensical in use/application. But, most everything can find a place in a certain routine. The Beekman 1802 Buttermilk Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm falls squarely into that category for me. \n\nFeaturing sunflower seed wax, goat’s milk, bifida ferment, milk protein, and shea butter...this super rich and nourishing feeling cleansing balm combines cleansing and nourishment into a single product.\n\nI’ll be honest in saying that this cleansing balm worked just fine for me over the past few weeks. It does a nice job of melting through sunscreen and excess oil. And while I am not a makeup wearer...the texture and emollient properties seem on par with other products claiming to remove makeup.\n\nOne of the things that was interesting about this cleansing balm is the total lack of scent either from additives or naturally occuring from the key ingredients. Rather than a creamy/milky scent that I was expecting...the Buttermilk Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm has an almost petroleum jelly/”industrial” scent that I wasn’t a huge fan of.\n\nBut, I think the result that has me steering away from this product in the future is the rinsing process/result after use. Whereas my favorite cleansing balms rinse cleanly yet without stripping/over drying the skin...this cleansing balm tends to leave a rather heavy oil/waxy feel behind.\n\nThis residue does rinse off with a bit more time/effort...but I could see those with oily skin really disliking the feel. I found my eye area particularly impacted by this as the amount of rubbing and massaging to fully rinse the product off sometimes left that area looking a bit red and overworked. \n\nThe result in combination with the comparatively high price considering the size makes this one that is just not for me. But, those with particularly dry skin or who are looking to incorporate milk proteins/nourishing emollients into their routine at all stages may appreciate this formulation. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Water (Aqua), Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, C10-18 Triglycerides, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Lauryl Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Caprae Lac (Goat Milk), Colostrum, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Lactose, Milk Protein, Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Honey, Eryngium Alpinum (Blue Thistle) Flower Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Symphytum Officinale Rhizome (Comfrey) Root Extract, Squalane, Whey Protein, Citric Acid, Glucose, Lecithin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate \n\nWhere To Buy (Ulta - $38.00 USD - 1.44oz): [https://www.ulta.com/buttermilk-makeup-melting-cleansing-balm?productId=pimprod2017544](https://www.ulta.com/buttermilk-makeup-melting-cleansing-balm?productId=pimprod2017544) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ehneq6fyzpq51.jpg?width=1337&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84ca4d2c70b61bd7942c25e35a3362ed241480b2",

I grabbed a bottle of Neutrogena Hydroboost SPF 50 (sitting in a hot car) and it was warm putting it on. Later that day my face and neck turned red, irritated, itchy for days. Dermatologist confirmed it was an allergic reaction to the sunscreen exacerbated by sun exposure. That was chemical so next I wanted to use mineral.\n\nA couple weeks later I used Pipette SPF 50 (20% zinc), went outside for 20 minutes and later that day again turned red, irritated, itchy. I know it's the sunscreen and not the sun because I was wearing a hat and my forehead and could tell where I applied it. \n\nY'all I'm stumped. Where do I go from here? The only shared ingredients between the two are glycerin and Hydroxyacetophenone. Could the Neutrogena flair be from being in a 100+ degree car? How do I patch test in the future?

A lot of other scalp oils are too heavy for me, but the nightly serum is so light and always helps reduce any scalp itch for me.",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

    "body": "Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Sun Essence SPF 50+ PA++++\n\nI’ll try to keep cool about this one...but I am truly in love with this sunscreen.\n\nThe Keep Cool Bamboo line is something thai have dabbled in before (the lotion from the line was kind of a “just okay” product for me). But, the Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Sun Essence has been so impressive.\n\nFeaturing a spf factor of 50+ PA++++ this is a high protection sunscreen that feels nearly weightless. Bamboo water, niacinamide, centella asiatica extract, and several forms of hyaluronic acid pair with the chemical filters to offer a sunscreen that reads more like a soothing moisturizer. \n\nIn practice...I have found this sunscreen to apply and layer beautifully while staying put a bit better than other lightweight spf products I have used in the past (looking at you Purito). I was able to hike for miles and miles while reapplying this product without any issues of greasy-ness, pilling, or migrating to my eye area.\n\nThe lack of fragrance/fragrant oils makes this a sunscreen that just kind of melts into the background...no irritation or lingering scent (at least for me).\n\nAs for the claims of soothing/calming...I didn’t really see too much in the way of that. However, I felt the same about the Keep Cool Soothe Lotion. Maybe the power of bamboo is a bit lost on me lol.\n\nEither way, this is an incredible sunscreen for its protection, weightless/unobtrusive application, and ability to “stick” to my skin even during mild physical activity. This product from Keep Cool will really be giving the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence a run for best sunscreen of the year!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Bambusa Vulgaris Water (401,800ppm), Water, Diglycerin, C12-16 Alkyl Benzoate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxylbenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Propanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, BehenylAlcohol, Lespedeza Capitata Leaf/Stem Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Thuja Orientalis Extract, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Polyisobutene, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Silica, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate\n\nWhere To Buy (Amazon - $24.99 USD - 50 ml): [https://www.amazon.com/KEEP-COOL-Protection-Moisturizing-Prescription/dp/B089ZZ7WZR](https://www.amazon.com/KEEP-COOL-Protection-Moisturizing-Prescription/dp/B089ZZ7WZR) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ub9vovn4bdr51.jpg?width=2888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=770bf8c9a9e744ca5681b7ffda9949a8fc74623f",

Maybe I'm just an idiot and, like I said, bad at analyzing ingredients, but here's the ingredients list for this product:\n\n>Water, Propanediol, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Glycerin, Ribose, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Fragrance, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Panthenol, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Chlorella Vulgaris Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Tocopherol, Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\nI mean I see the Citrus fruit extracts, but I'm not sure if that would be a usable form of vitamin C, and I see ascorbyl glucoside, but again: not sure it's it's like stable or usable or whatever the correct terminology is for this. I'm so sorry if I sound like a dumbass here, but I bought this serum for $20 thinking it was a great deal for a Vitamin C serum, used it consistently for a couple months, didn't notice any results whatsoever, and was curious about the legitimacy of its Vitamin C claim... Can anyone explain or just let me know whether this would be, in fact, an effective Vitamin C serum or not??\n\n(I also tried comparing these ingredients with the ingredients in [this Farmacy vitamin C serum that everyone's been raving about lately](https://www.sephora.com/product/very-cherry-bright-15-clean-vitamin-c-serum-with-acerola-cherry-P449400), and that one just \\*appears\\* to be much better, even without knowing much about ingredients... I see at least two (I think) forms of Vitamin C up at the top of the ingredients list on that one, while for this Sephora Collection serum, if it even has Vitamin C in it at all, it's pretty close to the bottom of the list aka not very potent.. right?)\n\nBasically, if you could just 1. let me know if the Sephora Collection Serum contains an effective/stable form of Vitamin C (and if it's high enough in the ingredients list to even matter), and maybe also 2. let me know how you can tell, like what ingredients should I be looking for when I'm comparing Vitamin C serums?\n\nThank you SO much to anyone who can help, I'll appreciate it sooo much (and I apologize for being a dumbass, sry!!)",

Are there any sciencey skincare addicts here that might be able to provide further insights on this from the ingredients listing below?\n\nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Purified Water (Aqua), Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Juice, Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Olive Squalane, Fruit Stem Cells (Malus Domestica, Solar Vitis) and BioActive 8 Berry Complex, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Resveratrol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10), Lecithin, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Alginate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Myrtus Communis (Myrtle) Leaf Extract, Lycium Barbarum (Goji) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Fruit Oil, Glyceryl Laurate, Linum Usitatissimum (Flax) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Amodimethicone*, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Riboflavin, Xanthan Gum, Melatonin, Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Leaf Extract†, Laminaria Digitata (Kelp) Extract, Phenethyl Alcohol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Raspberry Isolates, Vanilla Isolates, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil*\n\nI can see there's alot of other ingredients both before and after the reservatrol and coq10, so i look forward to hearing your thoughts on this serum as well as any other experiences you have had using this!

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI've been following a simple routine consistently for about a month, just cleanser and toner w/salicylic acid, added a moisturiser for about a week, then switched that and added a spot-on acne gel. Just wondering if some products of the ones I have are better than others, if some might be a bad idea and need switching, and what to be looking to add in. Maybe some from The Ordinary? I understand I need to go slowly, so if you tell me 'wait a few weeks, then add [product]', I can do that. I am, Ok, tempted to try some kind of drastic acid peel-all-the-skin-dramatically-off treatment in the vague hope of getting to start with a cleaner slate, but I guess that's probably not wise?\n\nIf there's anything I should do with spacing/timing and order to use things in, please suggest that too, I'm just layering products. Should I still be using everything first if I'm going to put make-up on in the morning too?\n\nAge: 33\n\nSkin type: Combination I think, but so oily on face it might as well just be oily\n\nConcerns: Acne, probs. hormonal, suspect seb derm which may be related issue (have salicylic acid shampoo). Noticeable sebaceous filaments. Visible oiliness. Some redness. One very fine line, may be vertical frown line, may be a scar.\n\nMake-up: Only recently got any again, have rarely used it.\n\nSuitability requirements: Vegan\n\nOther notes: I quit using products before as a teen because it wasn't working. The only thing that has ever made a significant ongoing difference, as a happy and unexpected side-effect, was switching to a dairy-free diet. I really don't like that one fine line due to the placement. I get that 'pores are normal', but the visibility makes me want to do something drastic involving strong acid. I have nerve damage so anything I use is prone to feel tingly/burny, making it hard to use that as a gauge, but my skin doesn't actually seem very sensitive in terms of real reactions to products. Not sure it absorbs products well. I'm not using SPF at present because I'm most often housebound currently, but feel free to advise on how to add this in for times that's not the case.\n\nCurrent products:\n\n**Cleansers**\n\nPrevise Dermapothecary Purify Botanic Wash\n\nI've liked this. Noticeable improvement just from using it and the toner dabbed on the worst problem areas, it seems to have fixed the flaky itchy skin under my eyebrows, skin is softer. Possibly pretty much anything would've had the same result, admittedly. The instructions don't actually say to wash it off with water, so, eh...?\nDid not seem to help with removing new mascara, as it dawned on me that I was not actually sure *how* to remove mascara.\n\nIngredients: Water, Algae Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Xantham Gum, Pentylene Glycol, Helianthus Anthus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Organic Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Oil, Organic Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Oil, Diglycerin, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Citric Acid, Silver Citrate\n\nSukin Clearing Facial Wash\n\nNot yet used.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Punica Granatum Fruit Extract (Pomegranate), Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Glycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Toner/Salicylic Acid**\n\nSukin Pore Perfecting Toner\n\nSmells satisfyingly medicinal, but results have varied from 'I'm almost sure this is helping' to 'I'm not sure this is doing a darn thing', which is possibly just usual breakout fluctuation.\n\nIngedients: Water(Aqua), Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract(Quince), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(Green Tea/White Tea), Zingiber Officinale(Ginger)Root Extract, Mentha Piperita(Peppermint)Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia(Lavender)Oil, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Salicylic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Oleate, Sodium Surfactin, Sorbic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\nSukin Spot-Banishing Gel\n\nI was hoping this would have the same kind of near-instant spot drying-out effect I remembered from the gels I'd used as a teen, but while it might be a little better, eh, not really, so far.

Have you tried simpler “dermatology” brands like Avene, La Roche Posay, Cerave, Cetaphil or at a cheaper high street level Simple? It may be worth reading up about some of these, they’re a staple on subs like this and obviously not everything works for every person but a lot of people see results when using their targeted but quite sensitively formulated products. For example the Sukin moisturiser says it’s oil free, which sounds great if you have oily skin, but there are a lot of plant extracts which can be quite reactive on some skin so could be less than ideal. Also I know it sounds strange but being oily is often to do with being dehydrated and your skin overcompensating, so you don’t always have to shy away from rich moisturising products - I didn’t use moisturiser at all for years because I thought it would make oily ness worse, but the moment I started to use a plain moisturiser my skin (including spots) was so much happier!\n\nI am waffling now, basically I don’t have very wise or specific words for you but you are definitely taking the right approach but maybe products from different brands or with simpler formulas might help? It’s such a pain figuring this stuff out, I wish you luck!",

Patients also completed tolerability assessment questions to review side-effects. During study visits, a board-certified dermatologist, blinded to study group assignments, graded pigmentation and redness.\n\nResults: Bakuchiol and retinol both significantly decreased wrinkle surface area and hyperpigmentation, with no statistical difference between the compounds. The retinol users reported more facial skin scaling and stinging.\n\nConclusions: Our study demonstrates that bakuchiol is comparable with retinol in its ability to improve photoageing and is better tolerated than retinol.

I would recommend sticking with your non-toxic cleaner, as it really doesn't look bad.\n\n**aqua** \\--> water\n\n**caprylyl/capryl glucoside** \\--> tensioactive agent (\"soap\"). Make the solution foamy. Also used in some skin cleaning products, derived from coconut oil.\n\n**laureth-7** \\--> another tensioactive agent (synthetic)\n\n**tetrasodium glutamate diacetate** \\--> Chelating agent, catch some ions, helps stabilizing foam.  Is often derived from plants. Also often found in skincare products.\n\n**limonene** \\--> Citrus fragrance, often abundant in essential oils\n\n**potassium hydroxide** \\--> strong base, raise the pH, helps getting rid of oils, also often present in solid soap (the process of making soap often requires a strong base such as KOH or NaOH and fatty acids).\n\n**hexyl cinnamic aldehyde** \\--> synthethic jasmine fragrance\n\nPlease chemists, correct me if I said anything wrong. My chemistry training was solid, was happened many years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award!",

I have a darker Brown hair colour and about 1/2 inch of roots to colour. I have some Wella colour charm powder lightener and Wella cream developer volume 20. I plan to tone after but I'm wondering if I should be concerned, since I've been reading some articles about metallic salts in box dyes. I know metal salt dyes can't be combined with bleach (burning etc) but I'm not sure if Olia hair dye has these salts and I was wondering if one of you wonderful people with more knowledge then me could let me know. \n\nHere's the ingredient list: \n\nColorant: Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethanolamine, Steareth-20, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Polysorbate 21, Toluene-2,5-Diamine, Steareth-2, Resorcinol, Parfum/Fragrance, M-Aminophenol, 2,4-Diaminophenoxyethanol Hcl, Sodium Metabisulfite, N,N-Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl)-P-Phenylenediamine Sulfate, Ascorbic Acid, Edta, Polyquaternium-67, Hydroxybenzomorpholine, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil/Sunflower Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil/Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Passiflora Incarnata/Passiflora Incarnata Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Thioglycerin\n\nTLDR: is there metallic salts in Olia hair colour and should I be concerned bleaching my hair at home after using Olia for a few yrs",

Metallic salts are typically the culprit when you hear about someone getting a \"chemical haircut\" i.e. their hair breaks off. It can also cause your hair to smoke and melt. I would recommend performing a test strand before each new color. Take a small section of hair from the lower back of your head and apply the color/bleach and let it develop to see how the hair reacts. Does it smoke, get hot, not color well, break, or cause your hair to feel like wet noodles? If the answer to any of those is yes, obviously don't go through with doing your whole head. If the test strand goes well, you're good to go!",

The serum you linked appears to have 20% niacinamide (if I read their description correctly) which is a lot already. I don't think you should use the essence and serum in one routine. You can use the essence on days where you're not using the serum.\n\nIf you find that your skin can tolerate both products in one routine without any bad effects, then feel free to use both if that's your choice. I'm just recommending that you don't do this to be safe. For most people, 2-5% niacinamide is already an effective amount, and higher percentages may lead to irritation. If you're sure that the serum isn't causing any problems for you, then keep using it, but if not, try pausing it for a few weeks and note how your skin is without it. Hope this helps!",

    "body": "I have tweaked this moisturizing shaving cream formula from Voyageur Soap & Candle to make it foaming, by my husband’s request. The new formula is still very moisturizing, and it has very good glide, but it’s still not foaming enough. From what I’ve been reading, I have a feeling that the SCI and SLSa were not good choices for this hydrous formulation with pH bellow 5.5. What would you use to boost foaming in combination with Cocamidopropyl Betaine and Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside?\n\nHere is the formula:\n\nFoaming moisturizing shaving cream\n\nIngredients: \n\nPart A\n\n7.0%\tEmulsifying wax NF\n4.0%\tStearic Acid\n\nPart B\n3.0%\tGlycerin6.0%\tCastor Oil3.0%\tLanolin2.0%\tJojoba Oil2.0%\tMTC coconut oil4.0%\tAlmond Oil\nPart C\n3.0%\tSCI1.0%\tSLSa68.0% Boiling Water\n\nPart D3.0%\tCocamidopropyl Betaine2.0%\tCaprylyl/Capryl Glucoside1.0%\tCetrimonium Choride\n\nPart E.5% Germall Plus.5% Silk Amino Acids\n\nDirections: \n1. Measure out ingredients of Part A in a mixing  bowl.\n\n2. Add the ingredients of Part B\n\n3. Measure and mix part C until surfactants are fully dissolved, then pour in the boiling water mixture in the bowl with parts A and B, melting the solids, and liquefying all the ingredients.  Stir slowly to ensure that all the ingredients are well mixed.\n\n4. With the mixture still warm, but not hot, add part D and continue stirring to emulsify.\n\n4. Allow the product to cool, stirring occasionally to ensure that the cream stays well mixed, helping to ensure a stable emulsion once cooled.\n\n5. Add the ingredients of Part E with stirring once the temperature of the cream has reached approximately 45 degrees Celcius. Germall Plus Preservative as well as the Silk Amino Acids can both have their effectiveness compromised with excessive heat. Botanical extracts, preservative, proteins, amino acids, or vitamins are all best added at the end to ensure their effectiveness.\n\n6. Lightly fragrance the product if desired. Either fragrance oils or essential oils may be used. Popular scents include citrus, lavender (many men like lavender), oceanus, or base, musky odours such as sandalwood.\n\n\n\nHere's a modified mixing process incorporating SCI or SLES:\n1. Prepare the Water Phase:\n    * Dissolve surfactants: Dissolve the desired amount of SCI or a combination of SCI and SLES in the boiling water.\n    * Add glycerin: Add glycerin to the water phase.\n2. Combine Other Ingredients:\n    * Add remaining ingredients: Add the remaining water-soluble ingredients (Polawax, stearic acid, castor oil,lanolin, jojoba oil, coconut oil fractionated, and almond oil) to the water phase.\n3. Heat and Mix:\n    * Heat and emulsify: Heat the mixture, stirring until the solids melt and the ingredients are well-combined.\n4. Cool and Add Preservative:\n    * Cool down: Allow the mixture to cool to approximately 45°C (113°F).\n    * Add preservative: Add Germall Plus and silk amino acids.\n5. Fragrance:\n    * Add fragrance: Add your desired fragrance oil or essential oil.",

Summary of Cat incl. pre-existing health condition.   \nB. My Question regarding current Poisoning - \"What action can be taken now?\"  \nC. Long timeline of Events   \nD. Ingredients in \"Everyone for Everybody\" Soap.  \n\n\nThank you for taking time out of your day to look this over and offer any help.  \n\n\nA. Summary of Cat   \n\n\nI recently was given this white with black spots female. She seems about 5-7 years old. She is very shy and I named her Shyla. She is a house cat that retreats and stays in my room which is warm and secure. At first she would sleep under the bed so I put a blanket down there. Now she primarily sleeps on my bed or a comfy chair in my room. Sometimes she will still retreat to under the bed if there is a loud noise in the house. I have taken her for 1 brief walk on a harness. She walked around a bit but wasn't very exploratory and didn't seem thrilled with the harness. I'm going to find a better one. She enjoys canned salmon juice, her hard food I was given (complete essentials or something), cooked chicken, a little bit of milk, a little bit of egg, really enjoys canned cat soft food ex. chicken, turkey, lamb. She sleeps most of the day with moments of activity. She is most active in the late evening and early morning. She will follow me around the house and enjoys chasing a shoe lace recently. She mostly enjoys being petted or brushed.  \n\n\nPre-existing health condition: Her left eye is discharging slowly some gunk when she sleeps that dries below it. I clean it off twice a day. Her right eye does as well but not as much. It doesn't seem very concerning but obviously is indicative of something. The person who gave me the cat included an antibiotic that was out of date. I'm not really a fan of drugs on humans or animals so I am reluctant to purchase more and plan on taking care of her with good food, activity, rest and plenty of water.\n\nB. Question\n\nI'm not near a vet for at least 16 hours and I am wondering if it is safe to continue feeding her water with a straw/container. I'm also wondering if 2% cow milk may help? What safe action can be taken? She doesn't seem like she's in terrible shape (ex. NO puking or drooling or moaning/crying or discombobulation) but she's obviously suffering and is very lethargic. Her right eye is specifically affected as she is attempting to clean it by wetting the limb above her paw and rubbing it from time to time. She does seem to be a little unsettled as in she is changing positions a little more often than she normally does.   \n\n\nC. Timeline\n\nLong Timeline  \n\\- Day 1: Evening 8PM. During the bath she was not that uncomfortable but did not enjoy the experience and was glad to be dried off. \n\n  \n\\-She began licking herself and shortly after, about 15-20 minutes following the bath she was visibly \"low energy\". \n\n  \n\\- I researched quickly and discovered essential oils can harm and be toxic to a cat.\n\n  \n\\- I noted she DID NOT exhibit any difficulties walking, jumping, moving around and still does not almost 24hrs later. Though she is slow to move but has demonstrated she is capable of moving fast if she wants/needs to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- She had a normal bowl movement about 40 minutes after the bath, it was about time for her to have one judging by her schedule. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- About 20-30 minutes following the bowl movement she began to hide under the bed as she does from time to time (if someone makes a loud noise in the house).  \n\n\n\\- I called her out from under the bed but she would return back under the bed shortly after.  \n\n\n\\- Day 2 At about 6AM in the morning after the towels had been washed and dried I decided to wash her again in the sink with warm water thoroughly to rinse any residue off of her coat. She responded about the same, not pleased with the experience and trying to leave but not freaking out. A little meow-crying.  \n\n\n\\- I rested with her on the bed and noticed about 4-5 hours following the wash around 1PM she was not opening her eyes normally. Specifically the right one. She would open them at moments but appeared very tired. She would lick her paw and try to brush her right eye at times. I used a tissue and water to wipe her eyelid and around her eye gently.  \n\n\n\\- Day 2 5PM: I gave her two small sips of water with a straw from a container. She has a bowl of water which she has not been drinking from since the bath. She also has canned salmon juice and her typical hard food in two separate containers which she smells and does not eat.  \n\n\n\\- 6PM: Following the water she seemed to be slightly more alert and moved around a bit more. May have been just chance timing.  \n\n\nD.

        "body": "The thing about foaming cleansers being bad and drying your skin out is a myth, it's very dependent on the surfactants (cleansing ingredients) in the actual cleanser. Specifically coco-glucoside which is in their cleanser is known for creating a fair amount of foam, but also being fairly mild for the skin.\n\nPersonally I always use [INCIDecoder](https://incidecoder.com/) when looking at new skincare products, it makes it easier to get an overview over different ingredients and their functions. The cleanser you mentioned has glycerin, which is a good moisturizing/humectant ingredient, so that should definitely help. It's fairly cheap so I would say try it, and if you feel it's drying your skin out try to look for something with more moisturizing/humectant ingredients, like hyaluronic acid or oils!",

I just noticed that it has 'multi-fruit AHAs' in it, but I cannot tell which ingredients are AHAs. \n\nI am a little concerned because I just started Curology three days ago, and my provider told me the following:\n\n\"I'd recommend temporarily stopping (for a week or two) any benzoyl peroxide, BHA (salicylic acid), AHA (glycolic acid, lactic acid or similar), and physical exfoliators such as rotating brushes while your skin gets used to the new medication. If you do want to use any such products, use your judgement and re-introduce them gradually over several weeks.\" \n\n\n\nIngredient List:\n\nAqua (Water), Lauryl Glucoside, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, C10-16 Alkyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Pectin, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Fruit/Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Callus Culture Extract, Fructooligosaccharides (D-beta), Glucosamine HCI (D), Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Ananas Sativus (Pineapple) Fruit Extract, Gluconolactone, Sodium Benzoate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Alcohol Denat.\n\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n-Which ingredients here are AHAs?\n\n-How strong are they?

Just basic ingredients, try to avoid strong fragrances if youre breaking up bad, i would completely avoid them if its severe. \n\nTry tea tree oil, it worked wonders for my scalp and even face be wary may sting a little so patch test! Also argan oil if you want a nice natural moisturizer i put a half pump on damp hair after shower.\n\nLastly for dandruff/flaky scalp i attribute it the most to drying, i would invest in a good blow dryer if not good technique and make sure its far. When your roots are dried well and moisturized i notice far less flakes. But its like your skin to rest of your body, itll grow thicker and thicker just gotta exfoliate right. Brushing your hair helps",

Then, I apply this lather to my face/neck and gently massage the Product into my Skin. After about 2-3 minutes…I thoroughly rinse the Product with warm water.\n\nWhy I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After moving towards purchasing more “clean” Skincare Products…this Brand was one that I found at Target pretty early on. I was drawn to their Products not only for the fairly minimal Ingredients Lists…but the nautical theme as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I ended up grabbing just a few of their Products (Oil Cleanser, Water Based Cleanser, and Moisturizer)…but Target also carries a Toner, Serum/Spot Treatment, and a couple of Products from their Hair Care Line. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After finishing up with the Peach & Lily Power Calm Cleanser…I was curious to see how the Sailor By Capitan Blankenship Product stacked up…so it went from my Stash to the vanity.\n\nOverall Review:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Right away…I love the packaging for this Product. The glass bottle should be incredibly easy to recycle/reuse…and Capitan. Blankenship doesn’t put it in a separate cardboard box. Reducing the overall amount of packaging is great and I certainly appreciate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Having said that, one thing I noticed about this Face Cleanser was the color of the Product itself. Now, there are no Synthetic Dyes in this Formula…and Capitan Blankenship says that the natural blue hue is due to the Blue Chamomile in the Formula. But as you can see from my pics…my Product is this dirty green color. While I don’t find it off putting…its kind of a surprise to see what this Product looks like right from Capitan Blankenship vs. what I got at my local Target. Not sure if this could be avoided by putting the Product into a box of some kind…but I just thought it was interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from the Blue Chamomile…this Sea Splash Face Cleanser contains Irish Moss (used for texture stabilization and hydration), Grapefruit Peel Oil, Citric Acid, Orange Peel Oil, Juniper Berry Extract, Kelp Extract, White Lupin Seed Extract, Beach Rose Fruit Extract, Sea Salt, and Aloe Leaf Juice. You’ll also find an array of gentle surfactants and preservatives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Although I was kind of wary of the spray application of this Product…it really does come out of the spray bottle just fine. This Water Based Cleanser has the fluidity of a Serum more than a thicker Gel Cleanser which I didn’t mind at all. Application is a breeze…just pumps is all it takes to get a fairly decent lather out of this Product (considering it is a pH Balanced Cleanser). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After just a few uses…I could tell that this Sea Splash Face Cleanser was a bit more intense than the Peach & Lily Product I had been using most recently. It didn’t leave my Skin dry/stripped in any way…it just didn’t feel like it was leaving as much natural Oil/hydration behind. However, the addition of the Essential Oils give this Product a wonderful citrus/herbal scent that I found to be incredibly refreshing and perfect for a morning pick me up lol!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that…I truly didn’t see any additional results or benefits from this Product. No real burst of hydration, soothing, of calming effects were noticed. After several weeks…I have to be honest in saying that I was kind bored with this Product lol. I’ve just had so many great experiences with other Water Based Cleanser…and even though it is a boring step in general I still found this Sea Splash Face Cleanser to be lacking.\n\nSo there you have it…I don’t think I’ll be coming back to this Product anytime soon. Sure…it is packaged wonderfully, smells pretty great, is really quite affordable, and has a very straight forward Ingredients List. But, it just wasn’t for me. I think those with more Oily Skin or are looking for something a bit stronger for the evening may appreciate the extra cleansing power this Product has compare to some of its pH Balanced counterparts.\n\nBut, if you are looking for something that is as gentle as possible while still providing a decent cleanse…the Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser is still the one to beat. I absolutely adore that Product and if came in a glass bottle…I probably wouldn’t be continuing my hunt for my HG Water Based Cleanser lol! I’ll most likely keep using the Sailor by Capitan Blankenship Sea Splash Face Cleanser as a Body Wash until I run out…and then reuse the bottle for a Toner or Essence in the future.\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Decyl Glucoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Caprylate / Caprate, Coco Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Glycerin, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Salt), Rosa Rugosa Fruit Extract, Lupinus Albus Seed Extract, Ascophyllum Nodosum (Kelp) Extract, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Citric Acid, Polyglyceryl-6 Oleate, Sodium Surfactin, Glycerin, Sodium Levulinate, Potassium Sorbate, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan), Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Juniperus Communis (Juniper) Berry Oil, Phytic Acid, Tocopherol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, \\* Guaiazulene, Lactic Acid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/78nctu2749p41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a6adbdb59849a3cfc5837c1e9793954dfabb575",

My hair is very short, fine and (maybe) unfortunately thinning.\n\nI wanted to try a \"natural\" (?) sulfate-free shampoo before going to a derm's. I suppose my scalp might be inflamed due to washing my hair 4x week with a SLES-containing shampoo (yeah I know...). In that case, would a mild shampoo solve my problem?\n\nWould you suggest one of the following sulfate-free shampoos? Notice that I live in Italy so lots of shampoos you have in the US aren't available here.\n\n**1st shampoo (meant for oily hair, would it be too harsh? Remember I would use it 3x or 4x per week):**  Aqua, Disodium Coco-Glucoside Citrate, Caprylyl/Cappryl Glucoside, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Lauryl Sarcosinate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Glycerin, Yucca Vera Extract, Sodium Dehidroacetate, Betula Alba Twig Oil, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Dicaprylyl Either, Lauryl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ethylheylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, lactic Acid, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**2nd shampoo (frequent washing):** Aqua, Disodium Coco Glucoside Citrate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Glycerin, Yucca Vera Extract, Sodium Dehidroacetate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum Oil, Citrus Aurantium Amara Leaf/Twig Oil, Malva Sylvestris Flower/Leaf Extract, Juniperus Communis Fruit Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Dicaprylyl Ether, Lauryl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Lactic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, d-Limonene, Linalool.\n\n**3rd shampoo (dry hair, I read that it could be beneficial as it's supposed to be more gentle, but what if it's too mild?):**  Aqua, Disodium Coco Glucoside Citrate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Glycerin, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Yucca Vera Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Lavandula Hybrida Oil, Sodium Chloride.\n\nThank you and have a nice day! :)",

For example one ingredient night be drying, but another may negate the drying quality.\n\nWe also don't know the pH of the product based on the ingredient list, which can have an impact on how the hair responds. Generally products with a pH of 4.5-6 are safest for the hair and help protect the color.\n\nHave you noticed color fading and are trying to determine what the cause is? If so, perhaps you could tell us about your routine and we can try to identify what might be doing it. Do you know your hair's porosity?",

I think it was partially due to the dish liquid composition and partially due to the relatively high content of olive oil on the dishes. There was also a blackened pot in the mix although I don't know if that would have made a difference.\n\nthe ingredients are:\n\nWater (filtered), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (plant based surfactant), Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (plant based surfactant), Lauramine Oxide (plant based surfactant), Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (plant based surfactant), Glycerin (vegetable based), C10-16 Alkyl Glucoside, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Carboxymethyl Inulin (plant-based chelant),  Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Grapefruit (Citrus Grandis) Seed Extract, C10-16 Alcohols (plant based)\n\nAnyways, before I realized it didn't wash off, I went and handled a bunch of stuff after washing the dishes the first time with the shitty dish liquid.\n\nNow dealing with the dishes was easy--I just rewashed them with something else. However, I tracked the residue on a lot of stuff that I'm not sure I really want to wipe down with Dawn, so I was wondering if there was an easier way. I'm sure Dawn would work but I have a feeling it will take a bit longer to clean out the Dawn residue with damp towels compared to just wiping stuff down with an amphiphilic solvent.\n\nThe best things I can think of right now are ethanol, rubbing alcohol, or acetone. Are there any others I might be missing that wouldn't damage plastics, wood, and other household items?\n\nNormally I wouldn't care so much, but the residue/fragrance seems to trigger migraines for me. And after four days of getting surprised by the fragrance of the shitty dish liquid when I eat something after handling something I forgot I left residue on and then going through a few hours of pain, it's getting super old super fast.",

        "body": "So to clear it up: something is either an amphiphile and a surfactant or it is a solvent and not an amphiphile. Literally by definition, an amphiphile is a surfactant.\n\nAs far as cleaning, I can't really see any solvent being more effective than dish soap and I really can't see dish soap being hard to get rid of. I highly doubt that even ethyl acetate will be soluble in olive oil to any great degree so you won't be cleaning off the food stuff much at all. If there's a lot of oil, it's possible your saturating the soap solution to the max oil content it can hold but just soap it back up a few times and it will all wash off. All dish soaps are pretty highly soluble in water so they should be washing off totally completely in something like 30 seconds of rinsing, at most. So at least as far as actually cleaning the dishes... soap is by far the best way to go.\n\nOf course, the cleaning doesn't seem to be the issue so much as the migraines. Simplest solution to try, in my opinion, would be switching brands of dish soap. If it really is the fragrances that are setting off the migraines then different fragrances should help. If that doesn't work, then I would try the solvents; but that just seems like extra work if all it takes is changing brands. I'd probably opt for isopropyl just for cost and availability reasons. They should all do fine for getting rid of whatever fragrances are still there.",

There’s just not enough detergency there to get a bath towel clean, even in hot water.  \n\nThe Heritage Park products are likely to be reasonably effective.  \n\nI’d compare with Tide Free & Gentle or Persil Free & Sensitive.  \n\nThe biggest hint to keeping luxury linens luxurious longer is to keep the drying temperature as low as practical and stop drying while they’re just barely perceptibly damp, then use “extended cool down” or air fluff to get them all the way to dry without adding more heat.",

    "body": "I recently turned 30 and while I kind of look young I definitely have not taken care of my skin and its starting to show unless I hide under a ton of makeup and not make any extreme facial expressions. \n\nI touch my face, rub my eyes, pick at my face, pull my eyes to apply makeup, don't wash my makeup off, use old makeup, don't use the correct soap or lotion, and have a pretty bad furrow in my brow from making angry faces and a ton of laugh lines because my husband is hilarious. I have wrinkles under my slightly dark puffy eyes, dry forehead, oily chin, etc etc. \n\nRight now I'm using a very very soft bristled brush with a flower petal shape bunch of bristles and the middle bristle bunch is shorter. I'm using Simple Truth Organic Lavender Orange Facial Cleanser, but it seems to really dry out my skin and isn't great at taking off my eye makeup. I end up scrubbing my eyes with a dry towel trying to get mascara off which I know is really bad. I also have eczema on my forehead/hairline that comes and goes.\n\nThen I use Morgan Miller Rose Hip Oil and apply it lightly with a beauty sponge at night or before makeup.\n\nI use Rico Baby Wipes with calendula to wipe my face in the morning or to try to get off makeup, but am probably too rough.\n\nI like to online shop and I love a good deal so I got three skincare packages of fancy stuff and I've been researching and creating charts for a few hours but I am at a bit of a loss.\n\nI don't want to put this stuff on wrong and fuck my skin up as I think I have sensitive skin.\n\nOk so here is what I got, what the site says what the stuff is for, and so far what I think the order should be. Some steps I have a few different products of but not sure what ingredients shouldn't be used together or maybe what is better?\n\nThanks!\n\n**^MORNING**\n\n* MURAD Renewing Eye Cream 0.5 oz\n* \n* PRIVATE DOCTOR Define Minus Serum 1.35 oz\n* \n* INC.REDIBLE COSMETICS Hemp Hydrating Lip Jelly 4 ml\n* \n* ORIGINS Original Skin™ Matte Moisturizer With Willowherb 15 ml\n* \n* PURLISSE BEAUTY Pineapple Bright Brightening Cleansing Gel 1 oz\n* \n* COMPLEX CULTURE Sonic T-Bar Facial Massager\n* \n* SCENTUALS Vitamin C Facial Serum 60 ml\n* \n* TATCHA Dewy Skin Cream 10 ml\n\n**^What ^It ^Does:**\n\nMURAD Renewing Eye Cream is a hydrating eye treatment that helps brighten, minimize fine lines, and reduce puffiness in one step. Made with a mix of peptides and retinol, it helps boost collagen production, making the delicate skin around your eyes feel more supple and soft.\n\nPRIVATE DOCTOR Define Minus Serum is no average face serum. Inspired by professional derm treatments, it uses micro-tingling spicules to deliver a cocktail of smoothing, firming, and plumping ingredients to the deepest layers of the skin.\n\nINC.REDIBLE COSMETICS Hemp Hydrating Lip Jelly is so soothing that it’s like a refreshing weekend retreat for dehydrated lips. Infused with cannabis sativa oil, this jelly-like balm hydrates and moisturizes dry, flaky lips, leaving them buttery soft and kissably smooth.\n\nORIGINS Original Skin™ Matte Moisturizer With Willowherb does way more than moisturize—this lightweight cream improves skin tone and texture, minimizes the appearance of pores, and helps control oil production so your skin looks matte throughout the day.\n\nPURLISSE BEAUTY Pineapple Bright Brightening Cleansing Gel is the perfect everyday cleanser for dull or lackluster skin. The sulfate-free formula gently removes build-up and grime, while camu camu improves uneven texture, and pineapple extract (loaded with vitamin C) helps brighten your skin tone.\n\nCOMPLEX CULTURE Sonic T-Bar Facial Massager is a sonic-powered tool that delivers a modern facial massage to increase blood flow, reduce puffiness, relieve facial tension, and help tone facial contours. Give yourself the daily luxury of an at-home massage to temporarily smooth and sculpt skin.\n\nSCENTUALS Vitamin C Facial Serum is formulated with vitamin C (the G.O.A.T. of skin brighteners), hyaluronic acid, and edelweiss stem cells. This lightweight serum helps hydrate, plump, and brighten skin tone while working to protect skin from environmental damage\n\nTATCHA Dewy Skin Cream is true to its name. This luxurious cream contains ceramides, algae extract, and purple rice extract to majorly up your skin’s dew factor.

        "body": "That’s a lot of text and a lot of products. \n\nYou should avoid putting that much on your face. \n\nThe usual order goes like this:\nCleanse - treat - protect\n\nYou could start with micellar water to remove makeup (Cerave micellar water is a good choice), then cleanse with a gentle (that’s important) cleanser. \nThen you put any treatment you are using (you should avoid using much, unless needed). \nAnd finally you use a good moisturizer (depending on the type of your skin) and sunscreen. \n\nI recommend treating only with vitamin c serum / niacinamide in the morning and retinol at night. Retinol is the most effective way to even the skin and reduce wrinkles and spots. \nAvoid any products with alcohol denat (so most toners and astringents) and exfoliants.",
