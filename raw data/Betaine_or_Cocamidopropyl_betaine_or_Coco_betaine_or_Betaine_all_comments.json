    "body": "hello /r/fitness!  \nfirst of all, thanks for all the info and experience you're sharing.\nwithout further ado, before/after pics!  \n&nbsp;\n\n[before](https://i.imgur.com/oq7sjsF.jpg)  \n[now](https://i.imgur.com/ygPi14X.jpg)  \n&nbsp;\n\n# little background history.  \nM/ 35/ 5'8\"/ 154lbs (177cm/70kg).  \ni was that kid that never plays any sports in the yard, then no sports in the school (i even had a special certificate for that, even not having any health problems), and then same kind of certificate at the university. and i thought that was okay, why bother. \nsoon i turned into the *before* person, not even noticing that. life was good. i guess i would stay the same (or even worse), but one of my musical idols made a [drastic change](https://s00.yaplakal.com/pics/pics_original/0/0/9/523900.gif) and, to be honest, this was my stimulus. and i joined a gym!  \ni had no idea what to do at that time, personal trainers cost a fortune and i couldn't afford one so for ~year i was doing the pretty common *fsckarounditis*.  \nthen, i found this subreddit (hurray!).  \nat that time the SS and GSLP were trendy on here, i picked [Phrak's](http://i.imgur.com/0uiw7qW.png) variant and was happy about it.  \nwhat i didn't realized back then is the *nutrition* part. thus, i completely failed *again* reaching my goal. even more, i was following some advice to start with a bulk to make a frame so i ended even in worse state. damn!  \ninteresting enough things turned around after i got married (usually it's the oppositve, at least looking at my friends and relatives). in my case, i got lucky as my wife has a part time of personal trainer, so she knows her stuff. from this point things took a new turn (~10% bodyfat for the first time in my life, for example).  \n&nbsp;\n# Nutrition  \nThis became the collar of my next chapter in life.  \n* calculated my cutting calories,  \n* my macros,  \n* changed the food i was eating,  \n* started skipping the breakfast,  \n* incorporated veggies and souces,  \n* diet cola (amazing stuff)  \n\nand things started to happen. i am tracking my intake at least 5 days a week. weekend a kinda hard to operate, because going out or, even more uncontrollable, visiting parents. because you just cannot say NO to your mother when it comes to food))  anyhow, these days i am trying to take only lean protein sources at home, thus leaving space for the carbs and fats i will get later out.  \n[weight loss for the last 3 months](https://i.imgur.com/Fjts5ja.jpg)  \n[daily macros](https://i.imgur.com/kwvpPXT.jpg) (175 protein, 195 carbs, 30 fat for a total of ~1700kcal)  \n&nbsp;\n# Training  \nI am a office worker and lucky enough that my work starts at ~11-12 in the morning, thus i am attending gym 5 times a week at ~930AM, when i'm driving to the office. i do enjoy this way better than 3 day at week. it soon became for me a usual daily routine.  \nget up, espresso, drive to gym, workout, drive to office, do your job.  \nregarding training i am working out in the *RPT* style  \n* starting with my heavy set in 4-6 range  \n* then -10% of load, doing an extra 1-2 reps,  \n* then -10% of load, doing an extra 1-2 reps, usually AMRAP.  \n    \nwhen i can do 6 reps in the first set, i add weight and start at 4 reps and so on.  \nmy routine looks like:  \nMonday: Chest/Abs (Incline BP)  \nTuesday: Back/Calves (Deadlift)  \nWednesday: Shoulders/Abs (Military Press)  \nThursday: Legs/Calves (Squat)  \nFriday: Upper Body/Abs (Incline BP 8-10 reps)  \n&nbsp;\n# Pre- and Post-Workout meals\nHere pretty simple. if i train fasted (what i do 99% of the time), as pre workout there is caffeine (as one espresso and 100mg caffeine pill) and yohimbe + leucine.  \npost-workout 40g protein + 70g carbs in a shake (whey, milk 0%, a banana and oats).  \n&nbsp;\n# Supplements  \ninterestingly, i thought at the beginning these are some kind of miracle and using them i can achieve it all faster.  \ntried:  \n* beta-alanine  \n* vitamin d3  \n* leucine  \n* bcaa  \n* citrulline malate  \n* betaine  \n* creatine  \n* spirulina  \n* omega 3  \n* yohimbe  \n* whey (read food, as it is food)  \n  \nat the moment from this stack taking vitamin d3, creatine 5g a day, spirulina 3g a day, omega 3 (2g as omega itself), yohimbe 16mg + 5g leucine before fasted training.  \n&nbsp;\n# Cardio  \nwhen i reached ~14-15% bodyfat, the fatloss rate started stalling, i had two choices: cut calories more or add cardio.  \ni chose second, as 1700 is already pretty low, so on my rest days i am doing 20 minutes HIIT: 10 rounds of springs - 1 minute full speed, 1:30 minute at less speed.  \nfatloss went thru well with this.  \n&nbsp;\n# Preliminary Conclusions\nnow that my cutting phase is over, what have i learnt:  \n1. chose a fatloss rate of ~1% of your bodyweigh a week, because it's managable and you less face cravings and such things  \n2. implement a *refeed* day. your current cutting calories * 30%. add carbs to this amount and try having fat at ~20-25g on this day. you may think it hinders your fatloss progress, but it's not.  \n3. implement diet breaks if your cutting lasts longer than 3 months. take a week at maintenence every 3 months of cutting. it will do you good.  \n4. have a deload training week every 8 weeks of heavy training. it's your usual routine, but at 50% of your working weights. give your body some rest.\n5. don't engage in a diet that you know for sure you can't sustain in long term.  just eat *less*. the universal rule *calories in <  calories used* is working perfectly.  \n  \n\n# Next Chapter  \nNow i am taking 2 weeks of maintenence (upping from 1700 to ~2000kcals/day), monitoring my weight and finding my real number and afterwards will engage in my first ever bulk, aiming for a 2-3lb/month weight gain, hoping most of this being muscle tissue.  \n&nbsp;\nsee you when my bulk ends!  \nIF any questions - please comment.  \nIF any advice - please comment.  \n&nbsp;  \n# Edits:  \n1. first off all - **thank you for all the comments, advice, and congrats.** pretty flattering to be honest.  \n2. confusion about my height. i am 177cm, so google tells me i'm 5.8 feet (?)  \n3. diet cola thing: when you're cutting you want to eat. sometimes smth sweet, sometime just eat. drink diet (zero) cola. it is sweet and pretty fulling so it's a win-win. at least for me it was a saver.  \n4. about my **meals**. my daily meal looks kinda identical for the working week, this is a typical meal (1700-1800kcal):  \ni train fasted in the morning, at 930AM.  just an espresso (and 4g Leucine). 0kcals, but technically  20kcals  \nat ~11AM have a post-workout meal (40g protein, 80g carbs) - 550kcals  \nat ~130PM have first part of my lunch (chicken breast with veggies) 300kcals  \nat ~3PM a snack ~100kcal  \nat 500PM second part of that lunch (i divide it in 2) 300kcals  \nat 730PM pasta with pesto alla genovese (damn goood!), a flatwhite with 160g milk, some potatos 450kcals  \nat 1030PM cottage chesse with kefir 120kcals  \n  \n# Final edit  \n  \nthis will be my final edit of this thread as soon it will be history, and this is normal. we should leave place for new ones!  \nthat was highly unexpected, given the fact what transformations i've seen on here and the feedback i received with my humble one.  **THANK YOU, /r/Fitness guys and gals**  \nmoreover, for the last two days i've received A TON of messages with thanks for motivation and inspiration. i cannot stress enough how nice this makes me feel, and i mean it... this fuels my for the next phase of my life and i want to remind you that **as long as you are committed and dedicated to a goal - there is nothing that can't stop you from reaching it**. i do hope everyone will get there and share his/her experience from their journey.  \n  \n**see you after my bulk**",

So now when I cut, I can cut at say 3250 calories.\n\nCheck this out: https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/how-to-bulk-and-keep-your-abs",

People think the process is annoying and a chore but the reality is, while it's somewhat 'grindy' at times, it's actually fun and something you look forward to each day! Furthermore, this took you a year to not only just *lose weight* but transform into another person. 1 year is a drop in the bucket compared to how long it took you to gain weight and do nothing. THIS is really inspirational and I hope others see it and just like what you saw in your musical idol, hopefully your post inspires even one person to do the same.\n\n\nBest to you and your upcoming bulk! Keep lifting heavy and put them calories to work. I'm excited for you because you're about to feel like superman while watching your lift numbers increase!!!",

The emergency chemicals flooded his suit saw to end the pain fast, soon he wouldn't even feel it.\n\nThe creature lay limp on the ground, unable to move.\n\nArc picked up the female, tucking her against his left side and chuckled at his twins misfortune.\n\n\"That one is smart-\" Arc waltzed over to the ever impatient Dr Duuarn. \"-and stubborn as stone. Kinda like you, Doctor!\"\nDuuarn's upper lip twitched.\n\n\"Hmmm yes,\" He snit back, \"Intelligence can be such a burden, the creature is lucky it is only half as dense as you.\"\n\nArc's expression dulled and he looked at the dog Suk was hauling into his own arms. \n\n\"Does being smart make you heavy?\" Arc asked out loud to the disbelief of both Suk and Duuarn. \"I mean, is it cause your heads have more stuff in them or?...\"\n\nSuk gave a stern sigh.\n\n\"Specimens subdued and secured. Ready when you are Doctor,\" The guard stated, ignoring his brother.\n\n\"Finally!\" Duuarn said exasperated, tapping away on his Dataslate.\n\"Krydon should have finished with the Creator Subjects test and be on his rest period, I should be able to have the Specimens systems flushed and ready for the next Quarter.\" He tucked the device into his long jacket and presumptuously made his way to the elevator.\n\n\"Hey Suk...\" Arc stopped his twin before the door. \"Is that why they're called bulge heads? Cause you know, like how Nerve-slates are heavier than normal data slates cause they hold more stuff? They're denser cause they weigh more, cause there's more stuff in them?\"\n\nSuk shook his head.\n\n\"You know, sometimes I wonder how it is that you and I came from the same egg.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"No, Arc. Being smart doesn't make you heavy.\"\n\n\"Right, I knew that...\" The guard hurried ahead of his brother. Suk closed his eyes, thanking Akira they had not been born as office clerks or something that required the use of a brain. \n \n---\n \n\"Okay...\" Jasmine grinned holding up her hands. \"Now I am holding up two fingers on the left, and three fingers on the right. How many fingers am I holding up?\" \n\nSigi sat back, smiling with her tongue hanging out. \n\n\"Bark! (*Fingers! Hands!*)\" Sigi replied proudly, and Jasmine couldn't keep a straight face. \n\n\"Aww, it's a good thing you're pretty huh Sigi?\" Jasmine teased.\n\n\"BarkBark! (*Good girl! Good Namegiver*).\" The translator chirped without any of the enthusiasm the dog had.\n\n\"Yes, and a very good girl at that!\" Jasmine repeated. She had calmed down a lot since her talks with Sieglinde. The human had tried to think of topics the two could discuss, but it was very obvious Sigi was a master of only a few subjects.  Her toys, trees and Oskar being her favourite.\n\n\"Okay Sigi, I'm going to go outside and let the doctors know we're ready to come out now.\" Jasmine slid down off the pod's gel bed and stretched her legs. The patient room was small, holding only the bed like pod, and a shelf filled with phials of prescription meds. Jasmine walked over for a closer look. There were easily over a hundred different vials, sitting neatly in packs of four. She picked up one at eye level, smooth glass cylinders, like D-batteries each holding a different coloured liquid. It was then that Jasmine noticed that the entire shelf was organised by colour! It made sense... She supposed, recalling how many clear medicines she had in her life. If their medical tech were advanced enough it would have been easier to teach what colour was for what illness then trying to remember the ridiculous names Humans had assigned to their own pharmaceuticals. Ibuprofen, paracetamol, codeine, betaine, morphine...\n'(*Oh? You've got a headache? Take the light blue one!... What colour was the one Xant had taken?*)'\n\nSieglinde suddenly snapped to attention. Letting out an excited bark.\n\n\"BARK! (*KIMIKO!!*)\"\n\nJasmine turned around startled.\n\n\"Huh, what? Sigi? Are you alright?\"\nThe dog did not answer her, jumping straight off the bed with ease and running up to the door. Pawing at the sensor to open it.\n\n\"Sigi?!\" Jasmine called after her, scrambling to put the medicine back on the shelf in the right spot while Sigi shot through the operations room. Jasmine followed, calling after the dog for some sort of explanation.\n\n\"Sigi stop! Heel!\"\nJasmine did her best to grab onto the dog, but the golden retriever slipped through her hands and picked up the pace, completely ignoring the gaggle of doctors on the outside and running down the hall.\n\n\"Bark Bark! (*Kimiko! Hear Kimiko!*)\" She bellowed excitedly.\n\n\"Sigi! Stooooop!\" Jasmine cried in vain chasing after her runaway dog.\n\nThe doctors, having been engrossed in the live stream of Jasmine's own neuro functions, were ripped from their discussion to watch Sigi and Jasmine disappear down the hall.\n\n\"Jasmine?\" Xant called and motioned to follow after. Rynard stopped him in his tracks.\n\n\"You better leave this to me doc,\" Rynard smirked, crouching down to ready a running start. \"You ain't going catch them at that speed.\"\nThe Captain took off, almost leaping with every step. It would take a while before his bulk would catch up with the agile human and dog, but there was no way either of them was going to outrun him once he reached top speed.\n \n---\n \nIt wasn't long before the Specimens began to wriggle. The dose Duuarn had prepared was only meant to sedate them for the transfer. It was wearing off quicker than expected.\n\nThe female began to thrash in Arcs arms, barking louder and louder as they drew closer to the medical wing of the station.\n\n\"Bark bark bark bark! (*Loud noise! Stop! Loud noise! Pain!*)\" She cried out over and over.\n\n\"What loud noise? I don't hear nothin!\" Arc argued with the dog. \n\n\"Stay still why don't ya!\" He ended up having to bring her to his chest, using all four arms to hold her secure.\n\n\"Bark bark bark bark! (*Loud noise! Stop! Loud noise! Pain!*)\" Kimiko continued to wail, doing her best to break free and pull the translator out of her ear.\nDuuarn's head spun around to see the commotion.\n\n\"Don't you dare damage my specimen!\" He snarled, reaching for his medipen. Spades growled at Duuarn as he got closer to his friend with another shot of tranquillizers.\n\n\"Grrrr (*Back off Vet...*)\" the dog threatened. Suk reached for the dog's jaw, clamping it tight.\n\n\"You will NOT be taking another bite, especially of the Doctor.\" The guard warned, staring down the fierce beasts ever growing temper.\n\nDuuarn aimed his medipen at Kimiko's fur and was about to administer a second safe dose. When a bounding ball of golden fur appeared around a corner and jumped into Arcs side.\n\n\"Bark bark!(*Kimiko! heard Kimiko!*) Sieglinde greeted happily. \nDuuarn stopped. His prized Specimen was roaming free, and neither Subject Creator or her dull escort were around.\n\n\"Bark! Bark!(*Spades! Kimiko!*)\" The golden-haired specimen jumped and ran excitedly in circles. Barking the same strange phrases over and over again. \"Bark Bark!(*Spades Kimiko!*) Bark Yapp! Bark, Bark!(*Namegiver! Found Namegiver! Good Namegiver*)\"\n\nThat strange phrase was enough to set the other two off, they became even more belligerent, even under the influence of sedation. Barking and growling to be let go. The males jaw broke free of Suks grip and tried to take another bite of the guard. \nThe golden needed to be detained for everyone's safety.\n\n\"Arc! Restrain her!\" Duuarn ordered, and the Arvas guard gave him an incredulous look.\n\n\"I know I've got four arms but these things aren't that easy to-\"\n\n\"Just force it to the ground!\" Duuarn snapped, turning his aim to Sieglinde.\n\nArc snarled at the doctor and begrudgingly followed orders. He lifted the struggling Kimiko, grabbing her by the collar and hanging her in the air. His left hands now free to pin the energetic golden to the floor in a quick strike. Kimiko's bark choked, her entire body suspended by the collar.   \nSieglinde yelped and struggled, but she only needed to be in place for a moment while Duuarn injected the tranquiliser-\n\n\"SIGI!!\" Jasmine's voice carried down the empty halls.\nDuuarns black eyes looked up to see the Creator Subject barreling toward them at full speed. \nHe had miscalculated her whereabouts. He rose immediately and hid the Medipen behind his back.\n\nJasmine let out another yell in panic.\n\n\"*What the hell are you doing?!*\" Her voice rose with the volume of her Freq, Suk and Arc shifted in front of Duuarn as he felt his own feet pull him to the back wall. Jasmine was not slowing down, she charged toward Arc and screamed at him.\n\"*PUT HER DOWN FOR GODSAKE!!*\"\n\nArcs hands fell limp to his sides.\n\nKimiko crashed onto the floor and Sigi scrambled to her feet, both dogs barely taking seconds before bounding toward the human. Spades thrashed until Suk had no choice but to let him go.  Charging to Jasmine straight after his pack. Jasmine staggered her pace, arms open wide to receive the terrified animals.\n\n\"Bark whimper bark!! (*Namegiver! Namegiver!*)\"\n\n\"Whimper whimper! (*Namegiver, safe, friend!*)\"\n\n\"Bark Bark!(*Namegiver! Female, Sigi, Friend!*)\"\n\nThey all shouted at once.\n\nThe dogs crowded Jasmine, who held and ruffled their furs reassuringly. Pressing her face into them, her tone soothing.\n\n\"Hey hey! It's okay, it's going to be okay! I'm here now! Are you alright?\"\n\nSmelly tongues and hot breath lapped at her face. Jasmine immediately rubbed Kimiko's throat, the dog whined thankfully nudging its head into her shoulder. She had not been seriously hurt, and for a moment Jasmine was relieved. \n\nDuuarn was terrified. He stared at Arc and Suk, did they even try to defend against her Freq pulses?!\nSuk gaped at his companion, Arc was a Defense artist. \n\n\"You gave in to her commands...\" Suk stated. Defence Artists were supposed to be extra resilient, they were supposed to ignore the orders of an opponents Freq. Arc stared back at him in shock.\n\n\"I... I know.\" He gulped, looking at his traitorous hands, \"I couldn't fight back, it just felt like the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"It *WAS* the right thing to do!\" Jasmine yelled. Standing up to her feet and glaring at the group. \"You were choking her!\"\nSpades growled, standing in front of Jasmine to defend the Namegiver as best he could.\n\n\"Grrrrrrr (*Takers, Vet, Not Friend...*)\"\nJasmine's hand rested on his head, gently tossing his ears.\n\n\"Easy boy... They're not the enemy just a bit misguided...\"\n\n\"Ruff! (*At ease.*)\" Spades sat at attention, acknowledging her request. \n\n\"Just what were you trying to do?! What is it with you people and trying to chokehold dogs?!\" Jasmine threw her hands in the air.\nThe three turned to each other, each one looking for someone to answer her. Duuarn stepped forward, hands behind his back, holding onto the readied Medipen for comfort.\n\n\"This is not standard procedure\" He began matter of factly. \"The specimens were refusing to co-operate we needed to subdue them to-\"\n\n\"Subdue them?\" Jasmine turned to Spades, kneeling down and holding his face as she asked him.\n\n\"Did they hurt you boy?\"\n\n\"Grrr whine (*Yes*)\" The dog answered without coercion. \"Whine (*Pain, sleepy*)\"\nOnce again the Esaander staff were dumbfounded, the User answered her without a single protest! He had been nothing but ill-mannered and stubborn the entire time, but he followed a single request from her. The Creator species must have engineered them that way, obedience to their makers. Another useful parameter, her species had thought of everything. \n \nJasmines outrage became ever more focused.\n\n\"Pain, sleepy?\" She repeated, before directing her confusion to the Doctor. \"Did you drug them? Why did you need to drug them?!\" She demanded. Duuarn took a single step back, returning behind his so called 'guards'.\n\n\"They were refusing to be escorted to Medical for tests.\" He explained, bitter he needed to divulge his motives to an unregistered Subject. Jasmine turned back to Spades.\n\n\"Did the doctor-\" She pointed at Duuarn, her voice was always soft when speaking to the Specimens. A tone Duuarn himself found insulting. \n\"-Tell you why you needed to go with them?\"\n\n\"Grrrr, bark bark Grr!(*No, Vet, No respect, Not pack*) Grrrrr whimper ruff! (*Take Sieglinde, not take Spades*)\" Spades answered, his bark growing ever more vicious.\n\n\"Good boy.\" Jasmine smiled at the dog, but her glare turned ugly toward the doctor.\n\n\"You didn't even try to explain it to them, did you?! What’s the point of giving them translators if you're not even going to talk to them?!\"\n\n\"There was no time.\" Duuarn defended.\"You of all people should understand the significance of these tests.\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand *completely,*\" The halls became their enemy as she stalked closer. Her voice raised and echoed down the white walls, every syllable became like ice. \"It's more *convenient* to drug them and take what you need, saying they were uncooperative than to admit your own *incompetence!*\" Every pulse was firmly directed at Duuarn, and he felt his blood run cold. \n\n\"The Specimens-\"\n\nHe didn't get to finish his sentence. Arc and Suk took either side of his arms and slammed him against the wall. Pinning him as Jasmine unleashed her wrath, from ice to an all-consuming fire.\n\n\"*Specimens?!* These dogs are *living, feeling* beings! With thoughts and fears of their own!\" The fury shook Duuarn to his core, his heart afraid to beat. \"I will not let you *abuse them* for the sake of your own *fucking* curiosity!\" Arc and Suks grip were like steel, unrelenting. They glared at him with the same intensity as the human, she had taken their will. The Doctor tried gasping, to call out in pain but she was unstoppable in her onslaught. He could feel the blood clotting in his arms. \"You're a *fucking* doctor! How can you treat them like this?! I thought they were going to help with whatever is left of your *fucked* up genome?!\" The dogs barked, but Jasmine was too consumed to listen. \"Or do you just get *off* on having complete *control* of-?!\"\n\nTalons grabbed her shoulder, and Jasmine's body went flying. \n\nShe let out a scream of shock as she was launched backwards, her body collided with the hallway floor, skidding against the tiles until she ran out of momentum. \n\nRynard did not turn to see if Jasmine was alright. \n\nHe stormed toward the twin guards and thrust his massive hands forward into his subordinates. They were almost crushed against the walls, wailing in sudden shock and pain. Forcing them to let go of the captive doctor and struggle within his own grasp.\n\nDuuarn slumped to the floor, utterly still, save for the tremor in his arm. \n\n\"*Snap out of it, you drones!*\" Rynard roared, equalising the disrupted Freq in the area. The Arvas twins gasped, breaking from the trance the human had unwittingly placed them under.\n\n\"Capt'n?!\" Arc stammered, trying to wriggle free.\n\n\"Captain, we're sorry!\" Suk begged his superior \"We couldn't stop it-\"\n\"*Shut up!*\" Rynard growled, dropping the pair, \"Grab the Doctor and take him to Medical *now*!\" He ordered, throwing his arm in the direction of the west hall.\n\n\"Yessir!\"\n\n\"Yessir!\"\n\nThe guards opened their wings and scooped up the paralytic Qzetillian, flying down the hall.\n\nRynard turned around slowly. \n\nJasmine had not moved. \n\nShe was curled up in a ball, shaking. The dogs surrounding her, pacing worriedly.\n\n\"Jasi-\" Rynard spoke.\n\n\"*Fuck off!*!\" Came the aggressive pulse. \"What the *fuck* was that for?!...\" Her voice crackled again. \"Jesus *fucking* Christ Rynard!.... My *fucking* arm...\" She sucked in ragged breaths, her Freq pulses a maelstrom. Fear, anger, confusion, pain, Rynard weathered them all against his own nerves. \n\n\"Jasi...\" He tried again, his voice a steady tone. Sending out nullifying Pulses of his own. \"You were hurting him-\"\n\n\"He was choking the dog!\" She cried out, another pulse of anger.\n\n\"You nearly stiffed him Jasi..\" Rynard growled, closing the gap between them. Jasmine gasped, holding her tender arm, suppressing the pain and tears. \n\n\"I had to get you away from the doctor,\" Rynard explained, \"You were Freq-frying him.\"\n\n\"You could have just *fucking* yelled 'Jasi Stop!\" She shouted back, \"You didn't have to break my *fucking* arm...\" She winced and struggled to sit up. Sigi and Kimiko nudged their faces into hers. Spades tried to stand up to the behemoth walking closer. They were strangely unharmed by her outburst.\n\n\"I needed to break your focus... Or you would have been attacking me instead.\"\n\n\"*Fuck*...\" Jasmine cried. \"*Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuuuuuuuuuuuuu-*\" She screamed in anguish. Rynard felt like a Freq-bomb had gone off. A sledgehammers worth of Freq hit him in the chest, and he staggered to one knee. '-*uuuuuck!*\"\n\nHer lungs emptied, Jasmine took another ragged breath and whimpered. She didn't think it was broken, but she wouldn't have been surprised if there was a bruise running the length of her entire arm in the morning. \"*Fuck.*\" Jasmine whispered one final time. '(*What the fuck have you done this time Jasi? You nearly killed someone over a bloody dog...*)' Her mind berated her.\n \n\"Are you calm now?\" The Captains deep voice asked, a claw scratching the tiled floor ever so slightly.\n\n\"Yeah. *Shit*...\" She panted, and shakily stood on her feet. Rynard rose slowly with her, never breaking line of sight.\n\n\"I can't let you come into contact with the others on the station. I'm going to have to escort you to Security.\" He explained firmly.\nJasmine nodded. The high energy from her attack fading fast, and deep regret was taking its place.\n\n\"The dogs are coming with me.\" She added quickly\nRynard nodded in return to her demand.\n\n\"Wasn't even going to try to break you up.\"\nJasmine glanced down, Sigi and Kimiko by her side, Spades in front defending her.\n\n\"Sigi... Kimiko? Spades? You need to follow me. Is that understood?\"\n\n\"Bark!(*Yes, Friend!*)\" Yapped Sigi.\n\n\"Bark bark!(*Yes, Namegiver!*)\" Barked Kimiko.\n\n\"Bark Ruff!(*Yes, Boss!*)\" Growled Spades.\n\nAll three dogs focused on her, ready and willing to follow orders unquestioningly. Like a Princess and her entourage.\n\n\"I'll come quietly, Captain.\" She replied, now so contained from what was a formidable fury. A living Freq-bomb, Commander and Big head all in one. Rynard was thankful there was only one Human on the station. \n\n---\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5tcesp/oc_research_transcripts_of_dr_xant_translator/) =[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6fpuyq/oc_transcriptspt_18_medical_enclosures/) = [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SquiggleStoryStudios) = [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/transcripts) = [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6jyk41/octranscriptspt_20_security_coms_log/)\n",

    "body": "Hello all! So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn’t hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible. \n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!), niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae. This is my one non-negotiable skin care item.\n\n[**Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Eczema-Therapy-Moisturizing-Sensitive/dp/B003O7IBZC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-3&keywords=aveeno%2Beczema&th=1) \\- Super moisturizing. **Colloidal oatmeal**, glycerin, panthenol, petrolatum, a ceramide, dimethicone. (People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).) And [Aveeno Eczema Therapy Night Time Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Baby-Nighttime-Colloidal-Dimethicone/dp/B01HI7VY84/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-4&keywords=aveeno+eczema) for something heavier but has same ingredients. You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

Tretinoin 0.025% Gel (Every night) + 4% Hydroquinone (3 months use, 3 months rest) **HG**\n\nI don't do wait times other than for sunscreen.\n\nI go SUPER heavy duty on moisturizing because I use two of the most irritating but effective skin care actives: tret and hydroquinone. The Triderma cream is really \"strong\" for a lack of a better description.. I normally used Aveeno Eczema therapy cream or CeraVe but the innisfree gel & cosrx snail essence makes them pill. I'm gonna switch out those two for something else because I love those creams and would like to have the choice to use it.\n\nThe La Roche Posay cleanser actually washes off clean, unlike the CeraVe Hydrating.\n\n(For people who are worried about parabens and hydroquinone, there is no need, we eat FAR more parabens and hydroquinone than we would ever put on our skin. Hydroquinone is not \"banned\" in other countries. It's just prescription-only because it's a very strong active so governments decided that people will need to use it under a doctor's supervision to avoid abuse.)",

I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I’ve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

It got so bad that I consulted multiple doctors and a gastroenterologist. I was prescribed PPIs and basically told my only option is to treat my symptoms. No mention of a microbiome, no other ideas on why I could be experiencing this.\n  \nAfter a few months on PPIs I started developing  a rash over my whole body. No doctor could give me a good answer of why it was happening. One night while doing my own research, I came across the video of a guy saying that most people who struggle with acid reflux actually have too LITTLE stomach acid, not too MUCH as I thought. It’s a condition called hypochlorhydria, and it is made worse by PPIs and antacids. All of the symptoms he described matched mine perfectly, and I realized the rash was an auto immune reaction to the condition. My mind was blown. Everything I thought was actually the opposite— the stomach needs to be super acidic to digest food, and when it’s not, the digestive system doesn’t work properly and you end up having reflux. \n\nI stopped taking PPIs cold turkey (not recommended), and my acid reflux was worse than ever for a few days. I started taking betaine HCI and digestive enzymes with meals as well as Seed probiotics with green power and L-glutamine first thing every morning. I also try to take apple cider vinegar when I remember. I’m feeling so much better and my stomach feels like it’s slowly healing. I take a little baking soda instead of antacid when I have bad reflux, but it has gotten so much better. I have a whole new perspective on my stomach and it makes me mad that no doctor had any advice other than PPIs. \n\nThat being said— why is low stomach acid as a condition not common knowledge?? Feels like a pro pharma conspiracy to me. ",

Everything i was eating had one of those three items in it. Come to find out, Canola oil was just approved by the FDA for human consumption right around the time i started my GERD and IBS symptoms. If i eat anything with Canola oil or the two dyes in it, i can feel it burn as it goes down my esophagus, it burns for about an hour and proceeds to bring on the GERD whilst it sits in my stomach, and then without fail, the next day i get the 8 hour long crampy shits. Canola oil is processed with Hexane, lye, and then bleach and is steamed in between these. Red dye #40 is a petroleum distillate that’s a throw away so they just HAD to find a good use for it (feed it to us) and blue #1 is coal tar. I’ve pretty much eliminated these three things in my diet and my GERD and IBS are all but gone. Not really an “allergy” but more like a chemical burn reaction imo. Canola oil is used in a butt load of baby formulas and protein drinks.",

    "body": "This post describes a plan for implementing a nutrient/supplement stack to address MTHFR.\n\nThe plan is in phases and incrementally ramps up over time, as it is quite common for people to have sensitivities to changes in their methylation status.\n\nThis plan is also a layered approach: each phase adds in a layer of nutrients/supplements. So, we are building an 'MTHFR stack'.\n\nThe view I am following for MTHFR is largely derived from that recommended by [Chris Masterjohn](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/mthfr-protocol), but with some differences, and the phases are my design. The result is therefore internet advice from a non-professional, it is general advice and not specific to any individual, and should be treated accordingly.\n\n\n\n# AIMS\n\n1. Due to the reductions in methylfolate production, the folate/B12-dependent remethylation pathway is impaired. Therefore, support the choline-dependent remethylation pathway.\n2. Optimize the impaired folate/B12-dependent remethylation pathway to make best use of its remaining functionality.\n3. Reduce demand on the methylation cycle.\n\n\n\n# GENERAL\n\n* Unless you have a specific reason to take them, avoid B complexes. They tend to be high doses and often cause more issues, rather than help. It also makes it impossible to adjust individual nutrient levels.\n* Avoid the synthetic vitamins folic acid and cyanocobalamin.\n* A food diary app like [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) can be very useful for tracking your average nutrient intakes, or looking up specific foods to see nutrient content.\n* Time per phase: A few people may be able to do everything all at once (assuming B12 levels are ok); other people who are more sensitive to methylation changes may require 1-2 weeks or longer per phase, ramping up doses incrementally during that phase.\n   * Just be aware that the more things you do at once, the harder it can be to diagnose which component may be causing you issues, if any occur.\n   * People with COMT V158M 'Met/Met' (aka '+/+' or 'AA') tend to be more sensitive.\n   * People with existing mental health issues can be more sensitive.\n\n\n\n# ABOUT MTHFR\n\n* 'MTHFR' is short for 'methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase'.\n* MTHFR is the final enzymatic step in the conversion of food folate, folic acid, or folinic acid to methylfolate. If the methylation cycle were thought of as a gear that is turned by a crank handle, then methylfolate is the hand that turns the crank handle - with poor methylfolate status, the methylation cycle performs poorly.\n* The cofactor is B2.\n* P39P\n   * P39P alternate name: rs2066470\n   * [74-95%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs2066470#frequency_tab) of people have the Green (-/-) variant.\n   * I am unaware of evidence that this SNP is impactful.\n* C677T and A1298C\n   * C677T alternate names: 677C-T, 677C>T, C665T, 665C>T, Ala222Val, rs1801133, C667T\n   * A1298C alternate names: 1298A-C, 1298A>C, 1286A>C, GLU429ALA, rs1801131, E429A\n   * These two SNPs can appear in different permutations of variants, which affect the performance of MTHFR.\n   * Per the [table on Genesight](https://genesight.com/white-papers/what-is-the-clinical-significance-of-the-mthfr-a1298c-polymorphism/), the resulting percent of performance for the various combinations are:\n\n|Genotypes|677CC (-/-) \\[GG\\]|677CT (-/+) \\[AG\\]|677TT (+/+) \\[AA\\]|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1298AA (-/-) \\[TT\\]|100%|51-73%|22-32%|\n|1298AC (-/+) \\[GT\\]|69-92%|36-60%|n/a|\n|1298CC (+/+) \\[GG\\]|52-60%|n/a|n/a|\n\n* **NOTE**: MTHFR is only the last step in the folate conversion cycle. There can be SNPs in preceding enzymes such as MTHFD1 or SLC19A1 which may also degrade performance of the folate cycle.  The Stratagene report mentioned at top of post will analyze these SNPs. Also, Chris Masterjohn's free [Choline Calculator](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/how-much-choline-should-i-eat-the) will analyze MTHFD1 and SLC19A1 from your 23andme or Ancestry data.\n\n\n\n# PROTOCOL SUMMARY / TLDR\n\n* This summary does not include all notes and details - see each phase for more detailed information.\n* When adding the supplements specified in each phase, *start with low doses* and increment up slowly over days (or weeks) to the recommended levels.\n* This is a lifetime plan, not a quick fix. Expect incremental improvement over several weeks or months.\n\n\n\n|PHASE|PURPOSE|SUPPLEMENT(S)|NOTES|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Resolve B12 deficiency (if present)|Sublingual Hydroxocobalamin or Adenosylcobalamin|If not B12 deficient, skip to Phase 2. Otherwise, supplement as needed to resolve deficiency or per doctor's direction.|\n|2|Improve MTHFR function|Vitamin B2, 10-100mg/day|If your only MTHFR variant is A1298C, B2 may or may not improve MTHFR function.|\n|3|Support the Methyl Buffer System. Reduces risk of overmethylation side effects.|Glycine, 3-10g/day and vitamin A (retinol form), 50-100% of RDA|Collagen or magnesium glycinate may be substituted for glycine. See Phase 3 details.|\n|4|Decrease methylation burden|Creatine (monohydrate or HCL), 3-5g/day|Micronized creatine mixes better in liquids. While this phase is beneficial, it is optional.|\n|5a|Determine total choline needs|n/a|Upload your genetic datafile to the [Choline Calculator](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/how-much-choline-should-i-eat-the) to determine dietary choline need. This will be given in units of 'number of eggs' worth of choline. If you do not have a genetic datafile to upload, use a choline need of '8 eggs' as your daily goal.|\n|5b|Support alternate methylation pathway|1/2 of the total # of eggs worth of choline|See Phase 5 detail for choline equivalents.   TMG may be used instead of choline for this portion (use 150mg of TMG per egg equivalent).|\n|5c|Support phosphatidylcholine production; decrease methylation burden|1/2 of the total # of eggs worth of choline|Do NOT substitute TMG for this choline portion. See Phase 5 detail for choline equivalents.|\n|6|Increase folate intake, as needed|Folate from food; methylfolate or folinic acid|WARNING - See Phase 6 details:  starting with too high of a dose of methylfolate can cause side effects!! Start low, go slow.|\n|Maintenance|Fine-tuning|\\-as needed-|Adjust supplements and dosages as needed over time, to compensate for improvements in methylation and to make your routine more sustainable.|\n\n\n\n\n\n# PHASE 1 - B12\n\n* We start with B12 because if we get MTHFR working better, there needs to be adequate B12 actually utilize the methylfolate that MTHFR produces.\n   * B12 is necessary to utilize the methylfolate (either produced by MTHFR or supplemented) to convert homocysteine back to methionine using the methionine synthase (MTR) enzyme. Inadequate B12 can cause a \"[folate trap](https://www.firstclassmed.com/articles/2017/folate-trap)\", where methylfolate cannot be used by MTR and so it accumulates; homocysteine levels rise due to the lack of conversion back to methionine, and tetrahydrofolate is not recycled back into the folate cycle, causing reduced activity of other important functions of the folate cycle.\n* IF YOU ARE B12-SUFFICIENT:\n   * If you are B12-sufficient and obtain adequate B12 from dietary sources, then there is no need to supplement B12. Go to Phase 2.\n* IF YOU ARE B12-DEFICIENT:\n   * If you suspect or know that your are B12-deficient, then supplement sublingual adenosylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin for at least 1-2 weeks, or until your doctor tells you are no longer B12-deficient, before proceeding to Phase 2, and continue supplementing until your levels are toward middle to higher-end of normal range, or as your doctor prescribes.\n   * Methylcobalamin can be used instead, but many people initially can be sensitive to the excess methyl groups provided by methylcobalamin, at least until Phase 3 has been implemented. So adenosylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin are simply less problematic at this initial phase.\n   * NOTE: There is an interesting [case report](https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.12966) where hydroxocobalamin, which is a natural inactive form of B12, was functionally ineffective in the patient. Replacing the hydroxocobalamin with methylcobalamin resolved the patient's B12-related symptoms.\n\n\n\n# PHASE 2 - B2 (Riboflavin)\n\n* If you have a C677T yellow (heterozygous), or red (homozygous) variant, or both C677T yellow (heterozygous) and A1298C yellow (heterozygous) variants:\n   * Research dosages were 1.6mg/day.\n   * Typical supplement doses are 10-100mg/day (either riboflavin or riboflavin 5-phosphate).\n   * Video: [How to get enough riboflavin from food](https://youtu.be/E5wR_iCWVyk).\n   * The C677T yellow (heterozygous) or red (homozygous) variant reduces riboflavin binding affinity. Higher levels of B2 will improve the binding success.\n* If you only have a yellow or red variant in A1298C, it is not clear if added B2 will help or not. It is up to you if you want to add in supplemental B2 in hopes it *may* help.\n* NOTE: Hypothyroidism can reduce conversion of riboflavin to the active forms FAD and FMN.\n   * [Abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3809170/), [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5015041/).\n* Reference: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16380544/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16380544/)\n* Video: [https://youtu.be/Fp6u82coOYE](https://youtu.be/Fp6u82coOYE)\n* Riboflavin has [no defined Tolerable Upper Limit](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Riboflavin-HealthProfessional/#h16), due to lack of toxicity.\n\n\n\n# PHASE 3 - Methyl-Buffering System\n\n* The body has a built-in system to store excess methyl groups and retrieve them when needed. This requires iron, glycine, and vitamin A:\n   * IRON: If you are iron-deficient, resolve that deficiency.\n   * VITAMIN A: Eat retinol-rich foods and/or supplement retinol-based vitamin A to at least reach [RDA/day](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#h2). Conversion of beta-carotene from plant sources to retinol vitamin A varies greatly between individuals and so is unreliable. I use cod liver oil (see my supplement list below).\n   * GLYCINE: Supplement 3-10g of glycine/day, in one or more of the following ways:\n      * **Plain glycine powder or capsule**s. If you are sensitive, ramp up dose over a week or so. (I use 3-5g/day in my coffee, as glycine powder is sweet-tasting.) Do not use TMG as a glycine source, as it is a methyl donor, and we are trying to prepare our body ahead of time for methyl donors.\n      * **Collagen powder** (e.g., Great Lakes collagen peptides). For some, this allows achieving the desired glycine levels while avoid an excitatory effect. Check the glycine amount in the ingredients label. NOTE: If collagen powder causes depressive mood, this [may be due to an absence of tryptophan](https://www.everywomanover29.com/blog/collagen-gelatin-lower-serotonin-increase-anxiety-depression/) in standard collagen powder. Consider switching to a collagen powder with added tryptophan or add tryptophan seprately.\n      * **Magnesium glycinate**. If you have a reason for supplementing magnesium, this may be an option. 300mg of elemental magnesium from magnesium glycinate [contains almost 2 grams of glycine](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/balancing-methionine-and-glycine-in-foods-the-database/).\n      * **Bone broth**. This can be another source of glycine, but the glycine content is variable, and [may be insufficient](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29893587/). Further, bone broth tends to be high in histamines, which you may want to avoid if you have slow MAO-A.\n   * NOTE: Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and is usually calming. But for some people, glycine acts as a stimulant.\n      * Chris Masterjohn has a [video](https://youtu.be/1uEDpHT0zWI) where he discusses glycine and GABA causing these kinds of paradoxical reactions due to a lack of carbs needed to create glutamate to offset the inhibitory effects of glycine or GABA, and in this second [video](https://youtu.be/7ugZ5X7M2uE) Chris discusses the role of electrolytes as related to glycine/GABA.\n* If interested, [here is a detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/169595o/overundermethylator_or_deficient_methyl_buffering) on the methyl-buffering system.\n\n\n\n# PHASE 4 - Reduce creatine demand on methylation\n\n* Creatine production uses up [40](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21387089/)\\-[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4754151/)% of methylation output (i.e., SAM).\n* Supplement \\~3-5g/day of creatine monohydrate or creatine hydrochloride (HCL).\n   * 'Micronized' powder products are finer and not gritty. I stir it into my coffee.\n   * If symptoms of overmethylation occur, start low and ramp up dose incrementally over a week or so.\n* NOTE: If creatine causes insomnia, please see [this post by Chris Masterjohn](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/why-would-creatine-cause-insomnia), recommending lower methionine (i.e., lower protein), keeping folate status high, and supplementing glycine.\n\n\n\n# PHASE 5 - Support alternate methylation pathway and reduce phosphatidylcholine demand on methylation\n\n* *CHOLINE IS THE KEY INGREDIENT TO MAKE THIS PROTOCOL WORK. WITHOUT ADDED CHOLINE, YOU CANNOT COMPENSATE FOR THE FOLATE PATHWAY (e.g., MTHFR) LIMITATIONS.*\n* Phosphatidylcholine production uses up another 40-45% of methylation output (i.e., SAM).\n   * Phosphatidylcholine can be produced from choline.\n* The alternate pathway (BHMT) through the methionine cycle unburdens demand on MTHFR.\n   * This path depends on B3, B6, zinc and TMG (aka betaine anhydrous).\n   * TMG can be created from choline.\n* Maintain healthy normal B3, B6, and zinc status.\n* Eat choline rich foods and/or supplement choline to achieve 1000 - 1200mg of choline/day. E.g., 8 eggs/day is \\~1000mg of choline.\n   * For a more customized review of your specific choline requirements, Chris Masterjohn has a free [Choline Calculator](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/how-much-choline-should-i-eat-the) where you can upload your 23andme/Ancestry/SelfDecode data and it will analyze relevant SNPs and tell you your choline need, in units of number of eggs.\n   * Chris Masterjohn has a [Choline Database](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/tools/2019/04/17/the-choline-database) of choline content of foods. Some are listed below:\n      * Eggs - a large egg has 136mg of choline; almost all of this is in the yolk.\n      * Meat/fish - 9-12oz of meat or fish is equivalent to one egg worth of choline.\n      * Lecithin - 1 tbsp of lecithin is equivalent to one egg worth of choline.\n   * TMG (aka betaine anhydrous) - this is a suitable substitute for only up to half of the need for choline, as [the conversion from choline to TMG is irreversible](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622158554#s0015), and thus phosphatidylcholine cannot be made from TMG. \\~150mg of TMG is equivalent to one egg worth of choline.\n      * Do not confuse 'betaine anhydrous' with 'betaine HCL': betaine HCL is not usable for this purpose.\n      * 1/2 tsp of TMG powder is \\~1500mg of TMG.\n      * TMG has little to no taste, so it is easy to add to liquids or food.\n      * TMG is a methyl donor. People with slow COMT or who are sensitive to changes in methylation should consider starting with small doses (e.g., 1/8 tsp or less) of TMG powder and slowly increment the dose over time.\n   * CDP Choline (aka Citicoline) - 18.5% choline content; thus 735mg of CDP Choline is equivalent to one egg worth of choline.\n   * Phosphatidylcholine - 15% choline content; thus 906mg of phosphatidylcholine is equivalent to one egg worth of choline.\n   * Alpha-GPC - 40% choline content; thus 340mg of Alpha-GPC is equivalent to one egg worth of choline.\n   * Choline Bitartrate - 40% choline content; thus 340mg of choline bitartrate is equivalent to one egg worth of choline. This form of choline reportedly is [less efficiently absorbed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893749/) than choline in egg yolks. Consider taking a combination of choline bitartrate and inositol, as the inositol may prevent depression that some people have experienced with choline bitartrate. In fact, choline bitartrate and inositol are often combined together as a product.\n   * NOTE: A small percentage of people may experience depression from supplementing choline. So monitor your mood for any indication of this.\n      * Consider adding inositol as this may prevent depression due to choline supplementation.\n      * Some alternatives to supplementing choline would be sticking with food-based choline only, or trying alternative choline supplement forms, such as CDP choline, choline bitartrate, lecithin, phosphatidylcholine, or Alpha-GPC.\n\n\n\n# PHASE 6 - Folate intake\n\n* It is important to keep in mind that we are not trying to 'fix' MTHFR by taking folate.\n* Why do we need folate?\n   * To supply folate for methylfolate production for the remethylation of homocysteine.  Although the methylfolate production by MTHFR is diminished, it is not zero.\n   * To supply folate for methylfolate production to turn off the methyl buffer system. There are several control signals between the folate cycle and the methionine cycle to maintain proper methylation levels. This is one of those control signals.\n   * The folate cycle is involved in DNA repair and replication.\n   * The folate cycle participates in the biopterin cycle.\n   * The folate cycle performs the interconversion of serine and glycine.\n* When to supplement folate?\n   * You are folate-deficient (per blood test).\n   * You were recently folate-deficient, and are still repleting your folate stores. This repletion may take several months, up to a year.\n   * Your diet is folate-deficient.\n   * You have folate absorption issues.\n* Increase folate intake from food. This [NIH folate list](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-HealthProfessional/#h3) may be helpful.\n* Methylfolate supplements are a double-edged sword: while methylfolate is a readily usable natural form, it is a methyl donor and so may cause sudden changes in methylation which can result in side effects ranging from symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, headaches, fatigue to depression, depersonalization/derealization, and more. Yet, if side effects are minimized by careful dosing, that boost in methyl groups can create a sense of cognitive and mood improvement, at least in the initial weeks or months of the protocol.\n   * Methylfolate Dosing:\n      * Sublingual, or liquid drops, is the preferred supplement form. Sublinguals can easily be broken apart into 1/4 or 1/8 pieces to allow starting with small doses. For even smaller starting doses, liquid drops may be better.\n      * Typical sublingual methylfolate are 1000mcg. So, a 1/8 size piece (barely a crumb) is 125mcg.\n      * Sensitive people:  Start with 125mcg once/day and see how it goes for several days. Increase next to twice per day. Increase next to 250mg twice per day, and so on.\n      * Very sensitive people: If even small amounts of methylfolate are causing issues and food folate is not enough, consider using the folinic acid form of folate. This is an unmethylated folate, also available as a sublingual. Follow the same incremental process above, starting at 125mcg.\n      * Very, very sensitive people: Use low-dosage liquid methylfolate and dissolve 1 drop in 10 equivalent drops of an oil (e.g., olive oil); this dilutes the folate drop by 10x. Then take just a drop of that diluted folate. Incrementally work your way up over time.  See [this video segment](https://youtu.be/GT27aTx3A70?t=836).\n      * Less sensitive people: Start with 1/4 sublingual (250mcg) once/day at a meal and see how it goes for several days. Increase next to 250mcg twice per day at meals. Increase next to either 500mcg twice/day at meals or 250mcg 3 times/day at meals.\n      * Final dosage goal: This is highly individual. Some people may find that 500mcg (1/2 sublingual) per day suffices, some may find that 1000mcg or more is beneficial, and as noted earlier, some may find food folate alone sufficient. You need to monitor your own wellbeing and health to determine what is right for you.\n* Folinic acid supplements are another natural usable folate form; however, folinic acid is not methylated, and still needs to be processed through MTHFR to become methylfolate. These factors make folinic acid much less likely to cause side effects compared to methylfolate.\n   * Folinic acid may not be advisable if you have significant slowdown of the MTHFS gene.\n   * Folinic acid dosing:\n      * Sublingual is the preferred supplement form. Sublinguals can easily be broken apart into 1/4 or 1/8 pieces to allow starting with small doses. For even smaller starting doses, liquid drops may be better.\n      * Typical sublingual folinic acid are 1000mcg. So, a 1/8 size piece (barely a crumb) is 125mcg.\n      * Sensitive people:  Start with 125mcg once/day and see how it goes for several days. Increase next to twice per day. Increase next to 250mg twice per day, and so on.\n\n\n\n# MAINTENANCE Phase - Ongoing Steps\n\n* With all the preceding steps, we have now implemented our basic MTHFR 'stack':\n   * B2 (1.6-100mg/day), if C677T is involved.\n   * Glycine (3-10g/day)\n   * Vitamin A (as needed to reach RDA/day)\n   * Creatine (3-5g/day)\n   * Choline (1000-1500mg/day, or as recommended by the [Choline Calculator](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/how-much-choline-should-i-eat-the))\n      * Half of the choline requirement may come from TMG.\n   * Folate source(s) (some combination of food, methylfolate, folinic acid)\n      * Monitor with blood tests as needed.\n      * Anecdote: 6-7 months after starting this protocol I rely almost entirely on food folate. I take methylfolate once/week, but I do not know if that is even necessary.  Every person will have to gauge their own situation.\n* B12\n   * Monitor with blood tests as needed, and supplement as needed, with hydroxocobalamin,  adenosylcobalamin, or methylcobalamin forms of B12.\n   * Ongoing B12 supplementation is not needed if B12 levels are in the desired range and dietary B12 intake is adequate, unless you have specific reasons or doctor's direction to continue supplementing.\n   * NOTE: Methylcobalamin may still be problematic for some people who are very sensitive to excess methyl groups.\n* Fine-tuning:\n   * You may find you need to adjust some of these components up or down over time, as your life changes or as your body adapts.\n   * Some people may want to experiment with additional methylation support, such as SAM (aka 'SAMe') to further optimize their health and mental state. Consider these as additional enhancements, rather than replacements for any of these stack components. Start with small doses and monitor.\n   * Pay attention to your body. You might find after a while that you have the urge to occasionally skip a day or more of some or all supplements. If this results in unchanged or even improved status, it may be a beneficial practice and/or a signal to revisit your supplement list and dosing regimen.\n\n\n\n# Supplements Examples\n\n* I provide this just as examples, not as endorsements.

B12 lvls in blood are around the upper range (eat a lot of meat).\n\nI take:\n\n\\- 7g of glycine  \n\\- 6 egg yolks for the choline  \n\\- Magnesium glycinate (150mg 2x a day)   \n\\- B2 (100mg)  \n\\- Probiotic  \n\\- D3 (3000iu)  \n\\- 2x TMG (500mg per tab, 1g total)\n\nI take most of these in the morning with breakfast and the second magnesium later in the day. I started (without this protocol) with a methylated multivitamin which initialy worked like a charm, energy returned a bit, though after a while it got worse gave me weird panic attacks/heart palpitations etc (was probably the methylcobalamin/methylfolate) so i stopped taking that. \n\nNow after finding your post and doing the above protocol for a while i get anxious again, dont sleep well at all and keep having to supress random panic attacks. As for the methylfolate, i have been taking this on and off, i cant say for certain if thats the culprit and if the effect lingers but ive tried the protocol without it for a week or so and no changes yet. Also tried SAMe for a while (which initially gave me a mood boost) and quit taking that because i thought that supplement was what was causing the random anxiety (been off it for 2 weeks now).\n\nAs for my diet, i'm currently trying a low histamine diet with normal ratio carbs/prot/fats because i still do strength training (i know its probably not smart with slow COMT but i do not want to give that up too easily). I use cronometer to make sure i get all the nutrients in.\n\nAny idea which of the above supplements might cause this?\n\nThank you",

I’ve done a fair amount of research but my brain has reached its max limit and now I’m stuck.\n\nI am currently seeing a functional medicine doctor who is recommending Xymogen Methyl Protect due to high homocysteine (11.2). She doesn’t trust the accuracy of my B12 (465) and Folate (13.4) levels in light of my gene mutations and multitude of symptoms, but they are considered “normal” by lab standards. She seems more knowledgeable than regular doctors I’ve been to who know nothing about this stuff, but she’s not as well-versed as I’d like her to be so I’m reluctant to fully trust her because I’ve had so many bad experiences trusting medical professionals in the past.\n\nI need help understanding which choline and/or other methyl donor supplements would be best for me because it seems like I have all sorts of mutations complicating things. I know I need to lower my homocysteine and support my B levels while avoiding over-methylation, but I don’t know how to do that in light of the following mutations I have…\n\nMTHFR (C677T) - HOMOZYGOUS (reduced folate metabolism).\n\nSLC19A1 - HOMOZYGOUS (reduced transport of folate into cells).\n\nAccording to Chris Masterjohn’s Choline Calculator I have an 88% decrease in methylfolate production. \n\nBHMT - HOMOZYGOUS (reduced conversion of choline to betaine?).\n\nCHKA - HOMOZYGOUS (reduced conversion of methionine to choline?).\n\nThere are several heterozygous mutations in there as well but when I start factoring those in I get too overwhelmed, however if there are any specific ones that are particularly impactful please specify and I’ll provide.

        "body": "u/tawinn Thanks for sharing this stack. I’ve made it to phase 5 and definitely feeling that my OCD symptoms have been significantly reduced for the past 2 months. I’ve very gradually moved through each of the phases, and noticed a benefit from each phase.\n\nInterestingly last year I started taking 5g of Creatine daily for my sport and fitness goals. (So I didn’t have to implement phase 4) And this also coincided with suddenly feeling chronically anxious from that time onwards. I stopped taking a methylated b vitamin supplement and methylfolate and it helped. But I’ve always been a bit wary that the creatine may be causing me to overmethylate. I am compound hetero for MTHFR but have fast COMT. The choline calculator recommends 1100mg per day. \n\nAfter starting phase 3 I have noticed a reduction in that anxiety. Which suggests that maybe I was overmethylating from the creatine.\n\nu/tawinn (or anyone else) is it just a question of gradually allowing my body get accustomed to the increased methyl groups in my system now? So instead of stopping taking the creatine I should stick to this protocol for a good amount of time to see if I’m a chronic undermethylator whose pendulum swings to overmethylation too quickly and I need to give it time to get used to the methyl groups? Because currently there are two issues I’m trying to solve: OCD (the original issue) and the anxiety, which came on a bit afterwords. The increased methylation seems to help the OCD but also pushes me into overmethylation. They seem to be diametrically opposite goals from a biochemical perspective at this moment for my body. \n\nAnd a final question I’ve been wondering is how the body knows how to use the glycine buffer to sweep up excess methyl groups? What does ‘excess’ even mean when someone is already a chronic undermethylator but a small, healthy increase in methyl groups shifts them into overmethylation? \n\nThanks!",

    "body": "Hi guys, thanks for reading. This is gonna be pretty long, apologies in advance. http://i.imgur.com/PUzAN.jpg\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I very suddenly (literally overnight) noticed that I started smelling terrible, despite having impeccable hygiene. The smell was described to me by coworkers as \"literally like feces\" or \"raw sewage\". When I say bad, I mean making customers gag from 30 feet away. I was warned by management that if I didn't take care of my \"hygiene problems\" I would be terminated, so obviously I quit.\n\nThe thing is, though, I don't have any \"hygiene problems\". I shower daily, wear deodorant and clean clothes, and wash all the nooks and crannies. I'm a bit chubby, but far from obese or anything.\n\nI went to two separate doctors who both told me I was fine. After months of experimentation with every diet and supplement under the sun, I've determined that taking a shot of vinegar before a meal - or more pleasantly, [Betaine HCl](http://www.modernherbalist.com/betaine.html) which I probably shouldn't be taking without a doctor's advice, but oh well - semi-reliably counters these effects. Any time I skip a meal with this, I'll smell terribly until I've, er, gotten rid of said food a few days later. **edit: Taking these clears the problem up within 3-4 days, as long as it takes me to get any previously eaten food out of my system.**\n\nFast forward 15 months to present. I finally worked up the courage to get a new job, thinking I had this, whatever it is, under control. Apparently, I was mistaken, as someone informed me tonight.\n\nWhat do I do? I don't have any more money to waste on useless trips to the doctor. I've considered working from home, but I don't really think that's going to work out for me.\n\nHas anyone here dealt with something like this before? Everyone else I've found on the internet that has apparently only believes in pseudoscience quackery like \"leaky gut syndrome\", or has just told me to pray about it.\n\n**tldr; I smell bad because of some weird medical condition and it's preventing me from holding a job. what do?**\n\n**EDIT 1:** Hey, this post actually got through this time. Thanks for reading! A few things I forgot to add:\n\n* Whenever this happens to me, I notice that the smell gets worse when I sweat - and it's not ordinary \"sweat smell\". Also, my sweat has a weird sticky quality to it, that I can feel on my hands first, and the rest of my body later. I'll know it's bad when I step out of the shower and I'm already all sticky from the steam and hot water making me perspire. A cold shower actually helps more in this case.\n\n* I do get bad breath when this happens, that brushing/scraping/mouthwash don't fix. Gum helps, though.\n\n**EDIT 2** Okay, you caught me, I'm fat. Seriously though, I don't think that's the problem. This problem didn't start with me being overweight, it *literally* started overnight. Also, if it were just \"I'm fat, end of story\", why would the vinegar/HCl pills clear it up within 3-4 days? I guess I can't rule it out, but I think there's another answer.\n\n**12:45 PM** I'm out for a while. Thank you guys so much for responding, even if it was just to call me fat. If the thread is still active when I come back, I'll post some more. Otherwise, it's been fun, even if this is the only time I'll ever make it to the frontpage.",

A few questions:\n- is it flatulence that smells things up, or just BO?\n- anyone in your family with similar problems?\n- worse after exercise?\n\nYou may suffer from a hyperhidrosis syndrome:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis\n\nThere are several things to check, especially a metabolic panel and endocrine function. Unlikely to be hyperthyroidism because you don't have associated palpitations, anxiety, and weight loss (sorry). Definitely NOT fetor hepaticus; you would be super-sick with liver failure before you started getting bad breath.\n\nIf I had to put it all together, I'd say you have secondary hyperhidrosis from newly-onset type 2 diabetes stemming from your weight problem. The timeline seems to fit. Even if you went 0-carb, it wouldn't necessarily affect your long-term metabolic function.\n\nTalk to your doctor, get some lab tests (which are not that expensive), and go from there. The diet may be related (and indeed vinegar affects your body's acid/base balance, and can influence perspiration) but a GI workup might be a red herring, and certainly a lot more expensive.\n\nGood luck!",

This I suppose sucks worse than most options as there is no cure, only symptom management.\n\nYou mentioned that your diet doesn't seem to affect it even if you choose either extremely healthy options or unhealthy ones. The problem with that is that a huge number of foods contain choline, which is what you can't metabolise. It's present in a lot  from fruit and veg to meat to peanuts. Some dudes over at the \"Body Odour Support Forum\" (There really is everything on the internet isn't there?) have compiled [this list](http://curezone.com/forums/fm.asp?i=1150493) of choline content in foods. While you can't eliminate choline from your diet, engineering a more precise diet built around this knowledge could help.\n\nSecondly, the wikipedia page mentions a study conducted in Japan about its treatment. After reading the paper, it seems a reasonable study with proper controls etc and based on that, it can't be a bad idea to try their recommended regimen of 1.5g activated charcoal and 180mg copper chlorophyllin per day. Amazon has both of those [here](http://www.amazon.com/Activated-Charcoal-260-120-Caps/dp/B0047TP6D6/ref=pd_sbs_hpc_2) and [here](http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Way-Chlorofresh-90-Softgels/dp/B00016AGBQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1306831843&sr=8-2) meaning you can get both for a little under 20$ which shouldn't break the bank even under your limited budget at the moment. \n\nGood luck and let us know how it turns out! \n\nEDIT: The addition of vinegar or additional HCl to your diet would also help oxidise the problem compounds by increasing the acidity of your small intestine. More acid = More oxidation = Less TMAs, more TMAOs. As a curiousity, did you try stacking vinegar, activated charcoal and copper chlorophyllin? Between the three of them assuming the study isn't lying through its teeth or you aren't one of the 5% who just don't seem to get anything from it, it might be enough of a cumulative effect to curb the problem.

Since the vinegar and  Betaine HCl work, it's very likely to be a specific issue digesting heavy proteins, i.e. meat.  I'm betting you're a blood type A, too.  Blood type A people have very weak stomach acids so proteins just sit and become stinky, stinky sludge instead of eliminating regularly.  This sludge clogs up the eliminatory pipings and the pores in the walls of the intestines.  The intestines are where food becomes nutrients and which then get absorbed into the bloodstream.  If it's blocked up, the blood is just going to pick up the sludge, which in order to eliminate it is going to push it into your sweat glands.  You perspire constantly, even when you're \"not sweating,\" so when the bowels are backed up, you are going to be a little smelly.  Being vegetarian, or at least eliminating non-type-A-compatible meats and cheeses will significantly help, along with continuing the betaine or proteolytic digestive enzymes for a week or two till the smell clears up, and then thereafter whenever you cheat.  Don't cheat.  Also add fiber to help scrub down the walls of your colon so that nutrients can get through to the bloodstream instead of sludge. \n\nAny green food will be immensely helpful because the chlorophyll cleans you out and often green foods have bitter constituents that increase digestion and immunity, both of which can help with smell (it's not *you* that smells, but the waste of the bacteria in your body that is feeding on your waste.)\n\n* Better food = better colon = better bacteria = better waste = more nutrients and less putrid sludge = cleaner blood = cleaner perspiration = better smell.",

Now the challenge: if you want them to separate the polarities must be as different as possible. That’s why isododecane and cyclopentasiloxane are used in the leave on versions (also because they are volatile which isn’t relevant for rinse off). You also want to add some salt to your water phase (improves separation). 1-1.5%. You need surfactants (coco betaine in this case) but if you use too much it will turn into a cloudy emulsion and you won’t get two defined layers. Start experimenting with as little as possible (say 2% ASM) and see whether it rinses off well. Re oils, I would lose all those weird veg oils and go for the mineral oil (unless you want to splurge on squalane which should also work in theory because it’s a hydrocarbon). Another reason not to use veg oils is stability. They are prone to oxidation (except for those full of saturated fats but these are usually solid). So, 50% mineral oil (mystic moments sold on amazon), 1.5% of NaCL or Mg sulfite, 2% of coco betaine (ASM not as supplied), water and preservative. It’s up to you if you want to add aloe and conditioning agents.",

Recently I came across a product that I thought omg, I need to post this on reddit bc there are a ton of people who would probably want to know this.\n\nThis post will cover the first [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) dupe which is a 99.999% match, is half the price (or usually less) - and the sole difference is that it has a different fragrance.\n\nIf you look up “Glossier Milky Jelly Dupes” the one that is always coming up is the Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser. That one is annoying because is not a real dupe at all; it’s just vaguely texturally similar and has a similar bottle, but the formulation has nearly nothing in common with Milky Jelly in any way. Kind of pointless.\n\nPresenting the last word in Milky Jelly dupes, the [ELF Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9). It is \\*nearly identical in every way\\* to Milky Jelly and is usually on sale for $3. Srsly.\n\nIngredients comparison:\n\nE.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser Ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 184, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, Isohexadecane, Xylitylglucoside, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Vb5), Hydroxyacetophenone, Isopropyl Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Xylitol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThese formulations are nearly identical. They have the same cleansing agents in almost exactly the same order, and even the same textural ingredients. E.L.F. was definitely duplicating the formula exactly when they were formulating.\n\nAs I've said, I've tested the E.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser and the Milky Jelly face wash and they are nearly identical. The texture is bang-on and the use experience is the same. There is just one real difference - the Glossier cleanser uses rosewater as the scent ingredient, and the Bounce Back uses a coconut fragrance. I’m sensitive to fragrances and it doesn’t bother me at all, it’s pretty light.\n\nThe best part? The E.L.F. Bounce Back Milky Jelly dupe is $6.00 for 100ml.\n\n$6.\n\nAnd when I ordered it for testing, it was actually $3 because E.L.F. always has sales.\n\nTo compare, Glossier Milky Jelly is $18.00 for 177ml + shipping.\n\nWhere to buy the Bounce Back: it’s is a little annoying, since they don’t have it in Target, or on Amazon it seems, but you can get it on the ELF website. Here’s the link:\n\n[https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9)\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I don't work for ELF, and never have, and think most of their products are very mediocre. But this one is clearly a copy of something already tested and popular (and I don't feel bad about sharing it because the Glossier Milky Jelly was a total rip-off/copy of the LaRoche Posay Physiological Gel, soooo)",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

    "body": "**What are they?**\n--\n\n\"Actives\" are the common term for the group of power players in skincare with ingredients that have direct, active results on the skin, and have serious science backing it up.  These include acids like AHAs and BHAs, and antioxidants like Vitamin C and Vitamin A (retinol and tretinoin). \n\n\n**AHAs:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n-\nAlpha Hydroxy Acids (**AHA**) are **water-soluble** and dissolve the bonds of skin cells on the outer layers of the skin, sloughing off dead skin and the glue that holds them together. This is *not immediate*, it just speeds up the process. This helps brighten and plump skin so it is not uncommon to recommend them to users who want to **combat fine lines and signs of aging**, are looking to **reverse sun damage or hyperpigmentation**, or are seeking a **more even skin tone and texture** in general. All AHAs have humectant properties, making them particularly nice for dry skin types with continued use. They all also **increase photosensitivity**, meaning sunscreen is even more important while using an AHA! There are also sources that show that AHAs increase dermal thickness and improve collagen density as well as quality of elastic fibers. [1](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081) [2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x/abstract;jsessionid=8F1BD9BC1178A87ADF7E90B6EBD17F44.d02t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false) [3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false)\n\nMost Common Types:\n--\n\n* **Glycolic Acid:**  It has the smallest molecules in the group so can penetrate skin deeply and easily, making it the most effective for treating fine lines, acne, blackheads, dullness, oiliness etc. An all around good choice but for its efficacy might be harsh for some, especially in the beginning during purging. Because of it's harshness, it might be better for oily skin types or users who have already built up a tolerance to AHAs. Sensitive skintypes or users who are new to acids might want to be cautious.  Glycolic Acid is **derived from cane sugar.** \n\n* **Lactic Acid:** Milder than glycolic but has smaller molecules than mandelic, making lactic acid kind of just the middle man in this hierarchy. Still gentle enough where sensitive skintypes won't necessarily need as much caution. Good for all skin types. **Do not use if you have milk allergies.** \n\n* **Mandelic Acid:** Larger molecules than both glycolic and lactic, which means it takes longer to penetrate but is also the least irritating, which is beneficial during the purge period. Ideal for very sensitive skin types. This AHA is made from almonds, so **do not use if you have nut allergies.** \n\n**PHAs:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n--\n\nPoly Hydroxy Acids (**PHA**)  function essentially the same as AHAs, however are far less irritating due to larger molecular structures, which limits their ability to penetrate into the skin. **Studies currently show no increased photosensitivity**, and **have been found to be compatible with clinically sensitive skin, including those with rosacea and atopic dermatitis**. All PHAs provide **humectant *and* moisturization properties** and enhanced barrier function. Most contain **antioxidants that protect cell lipids and membranes from UV damage**. In a study directly comparing AHAs to PHAs, sallowness and pinch recoil were shown to have greater improvement with AHAs but stinging and degree of sensitivity were rated worse for the AHA regimen as well. This makes PHA a great alternative and the so-called \"next gen\" of AHA.  [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15002656) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14756648) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15002657)\n\nMost Common Types:\n--\n\n...I kind of feel like this is a misnomer because PHAs are overall not as common or as studied compared to BHAs and AHAs right now. Still, here's what I've found so far, I'll be adding more as I find more information on them:\n\n* **Lactobionic Acid:** Derived from lactose, is a humectant, antioxidant and soothing. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20367666) compared lactobionic acid to glycolic acid, although I feel like it probably should be more compared to Lactic Acid. \n\n* **Gluconic Acid:** Also known as gluconolactone, is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. According to [this](http://128.11.40.183/lasernews/rubin_lecture/21.html), a 6% decrease in dermal penetration compared to glycolic acid. \n\n\n\n**BHAs:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n--\n\nWhile AHAs certainly aid in fighting acne, Beta Hydroxy Acids (**BHA**) are **oil-soluble** and therefore penetrate deeper in the skin, thereby degunking pores and breaking comedones. This process helps to bring things to the surface thereby making it a common suggestion for those **fighting and preventing acne** and looking for a **clearer complexion.** BHAs have no humectant properties, and are actually quite drying, making them particularly recommended to oily-skin types. BHAs **do not increase photosensitivity** with use. [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21921960) [2](https://www.drugs.com/mmx/salicylic-acid.html)\n\nMost Common Types:\n--\n\n* **Salicylic Acid:** is really the most common BHA player in the game, and it isn't *actually* a BHA  :3  It just essentially functions as one. Salicylic acid is commonly made by acidifying sodium salicylate (which is the salt of the of the salicylate ion). You pop off the sodiums and put hydrogens on there, and voila, salicylic acid. Is in general suitable for all skin types but preferred by oily skin types.  **Do not use if you have an allergy to aspirin.**\n\n* **Betaine Salicylate:** Essentially the salicylate is cut with betaines to provide a far more mild BHA exfoliation. Betaines are useful for helping prevent dehydration of the skin as they are larger in molecule and have a milder keratolytic effect. Suitable for all skin types but might benefit dry/dehydrated skin that find salicylic acid too drying. **Still don't use if you have an allergy to aspirin? At the very least patch test.**\n\n**Vitamin C Serum:**\n--\n\nA comprehensive guide to vitamin c serums can be found by /u/MissPicklesMeow, [The More You Know: Vitamin C Serum FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/)\n\n**Retinoids:**\n--\n\nWhat they do:\n--\n\nRetinoids slough off dead skin cells the way AHAs do, while also being anti-inflammatory, making them great for fighting **acne, anti-aging, and hyper-pigmentation.** They also function as cell-communicators: **improving the way your skin sheds and causing new skin cells to divide and function at their best** - which helps prevent premature aging and stimulate collagen. They come with anti-oxidants, but also come with a fair amount of irritation, more than the previous categories. [1](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/464026_2) [2](http://www.skinacea.com/retinoids/what-are-retinoids.html)\n\nMost Common Types:\n\n\n * **Over-the-counter available:** From weakest to strongest: retinyl palmitate, retinol, and retinaldehyde are all available without prescriptions. Most products with retinyl palmitate are often too weak to provide any major skin benefits, especially in terms of anti-aging - Retinol takes two metabolic steps to be converted into retinoic acid, while retinyl palmitate takes three steps. \n\n * **Prescription strength retinoids:** From weakest to strongest: Adapalene, Tretinoin (or retinoic acid), Tazarotene, Isotretinoin. Aside from the type of retinoid, each individual product also has its own individual retinoid concentrations. Generally, you go with the strongest retinoid you can tolerate with the least amount of irritation, even if that retinoid is considered weak. \n\nA note: Retinoid creams do not replace or substitute moisturizers, though you can certainly cut them into the moisturizer to try and buffer irritation. \n\n---\n\n**Popular Products:**\n--\nCosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid\n\nNeulii Teatree BHA Blemish Control Serum\n\n CosRx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid\n\nMizon AHA 8% Peeling Serum\n\nMelano CC Spot Treatment\n\nOST C20 and C21.5\n\n*For a more comprehensive list on AHAs/BHAs, check out /u/the_acid_queen's [Asian Acids: an AHA/BHA Supercut](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3l78ir/asian_acids_an_ahabha_supercut/).

The typical consumer is not interested in any product that would cause any irritation, even if they might ultimately prove beneficial to a routine. So the AB brands shy away from it since there just isn't much money to be made from it. CosRx and others do have an online base, and so their approach and market might be slightly different, but is by and large not a reflection on the overall trends in Asia currently, though we may see changes in this in the future. \n\n* ***Where in my routine should these products go?***\n\nThe [Product and Routine Order FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2tokdr/product_and_routine_order_faq/) on the sidebar has this covered in detail and in resources, however the one resource I link to the most from that page is /u/fanserviced's [Visual Guide to the Korean Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3jfug1/visual_guide_to_the_korean_skincare_routine/?sort=old) which is a nice quick cheat sheet to reference. You do *not* need every step included in a routine, it just shows every possible step and where it would be included. \n\n* ***How often should I use these products?***\n\n2-3 times a week is a good general frequency, seeing how your skin reacts and upping or lowering the frequency from there depending on concentration. With retinol products, depending on strength, you might want to only start with once a week. If the retinol burns, you can wash it off and try again the next night. \n\n* ***What about wait times?***\n\nWait times comes into the equation when you consider that these products are pH-dependent and work the best at specific pHs. This also dictates their product order. In following this thought process, you would have to wait 15-20  minutes after cleansing to let your skin return to its natural pH, and then 15 minutes after the application of any/every acid applied after to allow it the time to absorb and exfoliate entirely. \n\nThat said, this topic actually gets debated every now and then. You will find users who do not adhere to any wait times and see no difference, others find that waiting can enhance exfoliation and prefer to wait for pH levels optimal for exfoliating, and other users still who will tell you that wait times led them to over-exfoliation and was too much for their skin. Potentially, not *every* skin is going to need their actives working at its most effective range,  so the tl;dr is, YMMV. Start with no wait times, at least through the purge period. As you get used to a regular exfoliation schedule and learn how your skin reacts to it, try adding in a wait time in increments of 5 minutes, up to 20 minutes. See what your skin likes best. \n\n\n\n* ***What exactly are pH-adjusting toners and do I need one in my routine?***\n\npH adjusting toners lowers the pH of your skin after cleansing, readying it for pH-dependent actives. They typically have some acids in them, but at such low concentrations that they are not effective exfoliators. \n \nWe do have a [pH toner list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3e39ly/do_we_have_a_toner_ph_list_and_faq_and_if_not_can/) but I think it needs an updating - It's still quite a useful resource to find out if your toner is hydrating or pH adjusting. \n\nMy personal conclusions from everything I've read (and I'm not an expert disclaimer goes here):\n\n-Tap water does potentially increase the pH of the skin surface, even with a low pH cleanser. [1](http://www.sebamed.fr/client/document/effects-soap_94.pdf)\n\n-There is a correlation between low skin surface and enhanced functions of recovery. Low pH cleansers are more important to this than water pH. [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467032)\n\n-Starting around ages ~40+, the emphasis on needing to lower overall skin surface pH to maintain healthy barrier starts to become more important as it cannot recover as it once used to. [3](http://file.scirp.org/Html/2-1050013_7244.htm) [4](http://emjreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/Skin-pH-in-the-Elderly-and-Appropriate-Skin-Care.pdf)\n\n-Continued use of acids can lower the skin pH overall, but overdoing it will lead to irritation. Which is why some skintypes *can't* handle it working at its most effective range, because it's overkill. Making the rise of the skin surface pH from the tap water and/or eliminating wait times fully/partially actually a good thing, because it then makes it more balanced, gentle and less effective during the ages or the skintype wherein it's more preventative rather than reactive. \n\nSo, if you aren't reacting to your water (some people can), if you and/or your skin's age is not yet near 40, and especially if you are new to actives, I would actually suggest not even worrying about any of it yet.  Trying to go full blast when your skin doesn't need it yet is a common reason why a lot of people end up over exfoliating or experiencing irritation. As recommended above, start with no wait times until you get used to a regular schedule and see how your skin reacts to waiting. If you find you are waiting 20 minutes after cleansing, start looking at pH adjusting toners.   \n\n\n\n* ***How do I patch test actives?***\n\nWith consideration to there being a purge period, it's a bit pointless to patch test for irritation with these products. You still need to patch test for allergy or immediate adverse reaction, which takes a 24 hour test and should be applied to a small 1\" area of the face. Once that is done and cleared you can move forward with full face, taking careful note of how your skin reacts through the purge period. \n\n* ***Wait, what's purging and how do I tell the difference between breaking out?***\n\nWhen you use any exfoliating active - BHA, AHA, peels, or retinoids -  your skin will start to push out all the gunk from inside towards the surface. Which means if you have clogged pores, expect it to turn into whiteheads, if you have pimples, they might start looking worse. This process is called purging, can only happen with these actives (meaning **you cannot purge from a new basic moisturizer**), and details the process that **things get worse and then start getting better.** \n\nThe time frame for seeing improvement after purging should be 3-4 weeks, but it can - with stronger actives like retinoids - take even longer - But you should still start seeing improvements by that time. My suggestion is to **wait at least one month**, taking extra care to **listen to your skin** and look out for signs that it might not be purging:\n\n-If they get worse and stay worse, that is not purging. \n\n-If you start having *persistent* break outs in places that is not normal for you to break out, it is not purging (purging = short term, break out = long term).\n\n-If you experience tiny red bumps and itching, that is probably an allergic reaction and not purging. \n\n-If you stop using the product and your skin immediately calms down, then your skin was experiencing irritation rather than purging. If you stop use and your skin does not calm down but stays the same, then it was purging or a breakout. If your skin feels hot, prickly, or more sensitive than usual, than it is more than likely irritation or a sign that you are over-exfoliating. \n\n* ***What are the signs of over-exfoliating?***\n\n*Subtle to medium signs of over-exfoliating:* Shiny skin/forehead, increased oil production, puffiness, slight increase of sensitivity, breakouts of the small yet annoying scale, overall feeling of tightness/dryness/loss of moisture, blotchiness, patchiness, redness.\n\n*The your-skin-is-screaming-at-you-to-stop signs:* Burning, itching, feeling of heat, extreme sensitivity, cystic eruptions. Your face will be angry, it's kind of hard to miss. \n\nYou could show subtle to medium signs for a while and not realize it if you aren't in tune to your skin. Some people react in like a day, and that sucks but at least it's easy - others it can get bad only after a couple weeks to up to a month.\n\n\n* ***I over-exfoliated :( How do I repair my barrier and how long will it take?***\n\nWell, the first thing is to cut out all exfoliators until your skin bounces back. Then, go bland with the rest of your routine. Make sure you're washing your face with a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser and prioritize hydrating and moisturizing your face until your skin can repair itself. Ceramides, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, zinc oxide, aloe, snail are among the ingredients that will help the most during this period, so having them in your arsenal helps even before you start using actives. As far as how long it will take, be patient, it can take up to a month or more for your barrier to repair itself. \n \n\n* ***Are there any bad combinations or ingredients that shouldn't go together?***\n\n-Copper peptides and vitamin C can cancel each other out \n[1](http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/content/94/4/1259.short) but other sources say it's likely a myth and needs further study. \n\n-Niacinamide can cause flushing in some people when introduced to acidic pHs, particularly L-AA vitamin c serums, but not everybody is sensitive to this. If you find you are sensitive, a 20 minute wait time between products should be enough to combat this. Have two opposing sources on this topic:  [1](http://kindofstephen.com/can-you-use-niacinamide-and-vitamin-c-ascorbic/) [2](https://www.futurederm.com/should-niacinamide-and-l-ascorbic-acid-be-used-together/)\n\n-Retinoids and waxing do not go together. Even at low strengths, you can irritate and/or lift skin when waxing while having a retinoid in your routine. Your esthetician should ask you beforehand. \n\n-Benzoyl peroxide can render topical tretinoin ineffective, but the combo is okay when formulated properly to be together [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958193/)\n\n-Seriously, make sure you're wearing sunscreen if you are using AHAs or retinoids. I mean, you should be diligent about sunscreen anyways, but seriously guis. You'll do more damage than good if you begin use of these products and do not use sunscreen. \n\n-When starting multiple actives, it's mostly just common sense that dictates to ease in very slowly. Retinol especially, you might want to cut out all actives for a while and re-introduce them later once you've built some tolerance. It isn't so much that it's bad to have it in one routine, it's just way easier to experience over-exfoliation and irritation. You want to avoid that by practicing caution and going slow. \n\n\n* ***Do PoC and/or darker skin tones benefit from a certain types more than others?***\n\nI've found hearsay about how darker skin tones tend to prefer glycolic acid over others, and I've found hearsay that has said that PoC tend to experience more irritation than others when using acids to the point where glycolic is even discouraged. So. I wanted to address all of these notes specifically with some extra research, and have found the following:\n\nThere *is* [a larger risk of PIH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921758/pdf/jcad_3_7_20.pdf) in regards to use of acids in any large percentage, ie, chemical peels. \n\n\nAs far as overall irritation and risk, here is a study on the [effect on Asian skin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9107290), one targeting the [effect on darker skin tones of Indians with melasma](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12269877), and one [comparing glycolic to mandelic](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-4725.2008.34383.x/full) - In this the combination of mandelic *and* salicylic proved more effective but took longer to showcase than simply using glycolic. All of these studies say yay. good to go on using acids. I also found [salicylic was safe and improved acne and hyperpigmentation in darker racial ethnic groups](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9935087). So, aside from the risk of PIH cited from the first study, no further risk for irritations should be expected compared to other groups, nor is one acid shown to be more favorable than another? At least not from what I've found?\n\nIn [Management of hyperpigmentation in darker racial ethnic groups](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19608057) ([full text here](http://www.obgynnews.com/fileadmin/content_pdf/san/scms_pdf/Vol28_i2_Hyperpigmentation.pdf)) it's concluded that \"Given the propensity of darker skin to hyperpigment, peeling agents and resurfacing procedures should be used with care and caution. Maximal results are best achieved with repetitive, superficial, resurfacing modalities.\" \n\nSo with all that, I would say it's not a matter of one acid being better than another for darker skin tones, or that they experience more irritation. They do however have to **take special care and caution for melasma and hyperpigmentation, and in that it's moreso the method than the acid- Lower percentages for long term maintenance are more ideal than higher percentages for short term resurfacing and peels.** If anyone has further research, insights, or thoughts on this subject I'd love to hear about it! \n\n---\n\n**Potentially Interesting Discussions:**\n--\n\n[Support group for over-exfoliators](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tac9m/can_we_have_a_support_group_for_overexfoliators/)\n\n[Keratosis pilaris and body exfoliation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3quyvs/keratosis_pilaris_korean_spasscrubs_and_a_body/) and [Let's talk about body exfoliation!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4d42w1/lets_talk_about_body_exfoliation/)\n\n[AB versus Western](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/31iuia/has_anyone_found_an_ab_ahabha_better_than_the/)\n\n[A Note on Acids and UV photosensitivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4rq809/a_note_on_acids_and_uv_photosensitivity/)\n\n[How do Asians exfoliate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2brprj/how_do_asians_exfoliate/)\n\n[How often/which actives do you use?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4hw5br/how_oftenwhich_actives_do_you_use_how_long_did_it/)\n\n[Your thoughts on physical exfoliation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3gbs7q/your_thoughts_on_physical_exfoliation/)\n\n[Stacking too many products cause clashing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2vq3ex/can_ingredients_clash_when_stacking_so_many/)\n\n[Using actives - What's your story?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4chp7w/using_actives_whats_your_story/)\n\n[Which actives worked best for you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/400tkx/actives_vitamin_c_aha_bha_which_active_works_best/)\n\n[Washing off chemical exfoliators?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/48aahj/if_bhaahas_are_chemical_exfoliates_do_you_wash_it/)\n\n[AB Retinol Products?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/39by5n/retinol_products/)\n\n[For those who went through over-exfoliation, did it slowly start showing signs, or did you suddenly wake up with over exfoliated skin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3vgdmi/for_those_who_went_through_overexfoliation_did_it/)\n\n\n-[For those of you that have tried no/minimal wait times between multiple acids, what was your experience?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3z895r/for_those_of_you_that_have_tried_nominimal_wait/)\n\n-[ELI5/questions on toners, wait times, pH, etc](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/32mq81/eli5questions_on_toners_wait_times_ph_etc/)\n\n-[Skin pH and Urban Legends: An Argument Against Wait Times and pH-Adjusting Toners](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3vfa7s/blog_post_skin_ph_and_urban_legends_an_argument/) \n\n---\n\nFeel free to submit links for any of the above parts, discuss actives in your routine, submit a question for the FAQs or a discussion link for the PID sections.

However, when I returned home and started using the emulsion again, my skin was back to its smooth, clearer self in no time...in two days, in fact! I am in love with this product. It's helped me no end and I cannot rave about it enough. Anyone looking to try out a BHA, I'd strongly recommend this product.",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

That's just me tho :) The Cosrx is definitely weaker, but suitable for those with very sensitive skin who needs very slow exfoliation.   \n\n\n**QUESTION TIME!** \n\nDoes anyone know anything about JainaFace? How legit is this brand?   \nI have their 10% Glycolic Acid that doesn't even tingle on my face and seems to do nothing at all. Meanwhile, Cosrx AHA liquid, that has a lower percentage of free acid even, tingles. I suspect this brand to be a hoax but I'm not sure. Their 2% salicylic acid doesnt' really do anything for me either *(and I have spent 12 months testing out salicylic acids)*.  Same with a friend, she says she tried some products *(HA and some vitamin C stuff)* but that it didn't do anything for her face at all.   \nI contacted JainaFace a couple of months back to ask **1**. why they are allowed to use 2% salicylic acid in their products when the limit is 0.5% in Korea, and **2**. why there is next to zero information about this brand.  \nThe person who answered was nice enough but I find it shady that they don't want to market themselves... They claimed they would have to think about it, if it was true that people were starting to think they repackage and sell an American product, or that their products are generally fake/Chinese.  \nNothing's really happened except I saw they made a reddit account and posted a statement in  a reddit thread that they're not fake :P",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$18, available at most Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1046235717?cpid=1046235720&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1Qdkb986HWmYC5sW0qasR1pWtsW7lghSexIGgi-jRjHsBnCFbuQ2bVPKRoCtMgQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1Qdkb986HWmYC5sW0qasR1pWtsW7lghSexIGgi-jRjHsBnCFbuQ2bVPKRoCtMgQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1046235717%3Fcpid%3D1046235720%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/secret-key-fresh-nature-toner-248ml), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/collections/secret-key) etc\n\n**Who's it for:** Unsure - it's advertised on YesStyle for 'sensitive skin' and dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** Tried a couple of times mid 2020, tried again at the end of 2020.\n\n**My thoughts:** Not a fan. Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nThis is going to be long, but with everything going around about this moisturizer, I thought it was important to do some actual research on this product and its claims. There are a few things I want to clear up before I start:\n\n\\- This is not a post to start drama or to say bad things about Boxycharm OR Faccia Skin. This is simply research on the claims of the product and whether or not there is evidence that these claims are true. I intend to make NO speculations about this and only present the facts as I can find them (and cite them). If I do make any speculations, please call me out for it and I will remove them.\n\n\\- I am not going to tell you whether or not to use this product. This is just the information I think you should have to make an educated decision for yourself.\n\n\\- I have no stake in this product and hope that makes me as unbiased as possible. I don’t receive premium, and I don’t intend to buy. None of what I say here is based on my experience with the product OR any reviews of the product. \n\nFinally, the intention of this is to investigate these claims based on being an “average consumer.” I know that the actual average consumer does not actually do this much research. What I mean by this is that all this information comes from available online databases and resources, and the first couple pages of Google. I’m not doing a deep dive into any Instagram pages or people’s private lives to find this information. I intend for all of it to be easily verifiable by anyone who wants to find it.\n\nI will investigate 4 things about this product: cruelty free claims, safety of ingredients, benefit claims, and retail value.\n\n**Cruelty Free Claims:**\n\nAccording to [Cruelty Free Kitty](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/cruelty-free-101/cruelty-free-bunny-logo/) there are no laws to regulate when a company claims to be cruelty free. However, there are three organizations that have standards to verify a company’s cruelty-free status, and then allow them to use their logo to indicate to consumers that the product has met that set of standards. \n\nFaccia skin uses the PETA “Beauty without Bunnies” logo on their packaging, which means they claim to meet PETA’s standards as a cruelty-free company/product. Also according to Cruelty Free Kitty, if a company uses the logo but does not appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, you CANNOT verify that the product is cruelty-free.\n\nFaccia Skin DOES NOT appear on PETA’s list of approved companies, despite using the logo. According to PETA, in order to use the logo, a company must first be verified as Cruelty-Free by PETA, and THEN is able to pay a one-time $100 licensing fee to use the logos on their products ([PETA](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/info-businesses/beauty-without-bunnies-program/)). That means that if Faccia Skin is using the logo, they should already be on the list despite being a new company. The FAQ also suggests that this list is updated frequently so consumers are always up to date with additions, deletions, and other changes. [PETA FAQ can be found here.](https://features.peta.org/cruelty-free-company-search/index.aspx)\n\n**TL;DR – Faccia Skin’s cruelty-free status cannot be verified.**\n\nNote here: Other research on this sub has suggested that this company is owned by the same owner as DLS cosmetics, which is both PETA and Leaping Bunny certified. They may be licensing the logo legally, but from what I can tell, does not verify the cruelty-free status of this brand specifically. \n\n**Safety of Ingredients:**\n\nThis is the list of ingredients for this moisturizer on Faccia’s website:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, GOLD, HYDROLYZED SERICIN, CARBOMER, BETAINE, TAURINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, NIACINAMIDE, BUTANEDIOL, POLYSORBITULE-20, PALMITOYL OLIGOPEPTIDE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, ACETYL TETRAPEPTIDE-5, ACETYL HEXAPEPTIDE-8, EDTA-2NA, HYDROLYZED PEARL, FUCUS VESICULOSUS EXTRACT, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, PEG-40, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, METHYLPARABEN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DIAZOLIDINYL UREA, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, PARFUM, CI19140\n\nVia SkinCarisma, 8 products on this list have an EWG Health Rating of “Moderate” or “High” risk.\n\nModerate risk:\n\nGold – SkinCarisma identifies this as a “cosmetic colorant” with no benefits\n\nTriethanolamine – This has a comodogenic rating of (2). Incidecoder says that this ingredient is generally safe, but can form carcinogens if it is included in a product with nitra-/nitro- type ingredients. I don’t see any of those ingredients in this list.\n\nMethylparaben – This is a paraben (obviously). There is nothing directly unsafe about using this ingredient. There was a 2006 study that found that skin cells treated with MP had more harmful exposure to sunlight than non-MP treated skin cells. This study was done in a lab and not on actual human skin, so there’s no direct link to this being harmful. When in doubt, wear sunscreen\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea – A preservative, This ingredient is controversial because it belongs to a family of ingredients that may break down into formaldehyde when added to a formula. A 1990 study found that it is safe in concentrations of <0.5%. The evidence on this is unclear, and since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nIodopropynyl Butylcarbamate – Also a preservative. This is safe in concentrations of less than 0.1%, and has an extremely low rate of skin irritation. Since we don’t know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can’t say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nHigh Risk:\n\nButane – Incidecoder brings this up as Butanediol, which is a solvent to help products absorb faster. Its safety has not yet been questioned. It’s sometimes used as a food additive. HOWEVER the ingredients list does actually say Butane and not Butanediol which is used as a propellant. It’s still safe but it doesn’t make sense for an ingredient that is not aerosolized.\n\nFragrance – The problem with this ingredient is that “fragrance” is a general term that can be made up of an average of 30-50 chemicals that aren’t required to be disclosed. A lot of products use this term and are still safe, but because all the ingredients are not disclosed, we can’t say for sure. Use your best judgement.\n\nOther:\n\nPolysorbate 20 – listed as a fungal acne trigger, but is an emulsifier and is safe.\n\nYou can find all this information at incidecoder.com and skincarisma.com\n\n**TL;DR : Basic judgement says that this product is safe to use, unless you are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients on this list, react to comedogenic products, or have fungal acne.**\n\n**Benefit Claims:**\n\nOn Faccia Skin’s website, they make the following claims about this product:\n\nHydrate skin – We can expect this result based on moisturizing ingredients (glycerin, betaine, sodium hyaluronate, niacinamide, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, PEG-40, Propylene Glycol)\n\nAnti-aging – SkinCarisma lists Niacinamide as the only anti-aging ingredient.\n\nStrengthen skin – SkinCarisma lists Sodium Hyaluronate as an ingredient to promote would healing. Incidecoder also suggests that there are peptides in the ingredients which act as “cell-communicating” agents. Peptides are fairly common in other products that claim strengthening benefits.\n\nEnhance skin “radiance” – We can expect this based on the ingredient Niacinamide as well as moisturizing ingredients. Skincarisma lists Niacinamide as a “brightening” ingredient.\n\nReduce damaging environmental factors – This may be aided by Sodium Hyaluronate as a “wound-healing” ingredient.\n\nIt’s important to note that neither of these ingredient databases list gold as an ingredient with any skin benefits. Here’s some research on the benefits (or not) of gold for the skin from what I believe to be trustworthy sources:\n\n[https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html)\n\n**TL;DR – We can expect for this product to perform as it claims based on its ingredients. It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**Retail Price:**\n\nI did a quick search of “best 24k gold moisturizers” to compare retail prices for other notable products. It’s hard for me to definitively test the “retail price” claim unless there was a very similar product out there that I can find. So I’ll have to base this on comparisons as well as knowledge of the ingredients themselves. I don’t know the exact volume of the cream in mL so we are going to assume for now that 50g = 1.6 fl oz someone can get me the actual volume I will change this. So $100 for 1.6 oz is $62.5/oz\n\n[Orogold](https://www.orogoldcosmetics.com/shop/orogold-cosmetics/white-gold/24k-deep-moisturizer/) 24K deep moisturizer: $55/oz \n\n[Physicians Formula](https://www.physiciansformula.com/physicians-formula-24-karat-gold-collagen-moisturizer.html) 24k Gold Collagen Moisturizer: $12.5/oz \n\n[Chantecaille](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/chantecaille-nano-gold-energizing-cream-1-7-oz-prod50660039?childItemId=NMC0BE1_) Nano Gold Energizing Face cream: $247/oz \n\n[Farsali](https://www.sephora.com/product/rose-gold-elixir-P417139) Rose Gold Elixer (24k infused) - $54/oz \n\n[Peter Thomas Roth](https://www.sephora.com/product/24k-gold-mask-pure-luxury-lift-firm-mask-P392607) 24k Gold Mask - $17/oz \n\n[Nuface](https://www.ulta.com/gel-primer-24k-gold-complex-brighten?productId=xlsImpprod13521083) Gel Primer 24k Gold Complex - $19.5/oz \n\n[Ahava](https://www.ulta.com/24k-gold-mineral-mud-mask?productId=pimprod2004002) 24K Gold Mineral Mud Mask - $34/oz \n\nThe Faccia cream has a price/oz most similar to the Orogold and the Farsali products, and is much cheaper than the Chantecaille cream which is a luxury brand sold at Neiman Marcus. Comparing the Chantecaille incredients list to the Faccia cream, they are very different. The luxury cream has a huge list of various plant oils, extracts and perfumes. That doesn’t make it better, but it does have more ingredients. The Faccia base of water and Glycerin is similar to other water based moisturizers like Neutrogena Hydroboost, Simple, and even Tatcha Water Cream (although all 3 of those contain dimethicone and variants). Tatcha contains some more ingredients like plant extracts. It’s difficult to compare the ingredients lists of the Farsali and Orogold because the textures of the products are so different. However, the Farsali oil ONLY contains 24k gold, vitamin E, and plant oils as the ingredients, and is still cheaper than the Faccia moisturizer. Additionally, the Orogold lists Gold as one of the last few ingredients.\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be anything in the ingredients list other than gold that would justify such a high retail price. Even other notable brands sold at Ulta and Sephora with gold in them do not reach that retail price, which suggests that the gold alone would not be enough to justify such a high retail price. In fact, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate and Methylparaben are all described as “cheap” ingredients on Incidecoder. One of the other star ingredients, niacinamide, is in a lot of products, and I can’t find anything that would indicate it is expensive. You can buy a niacinamide 10% suspension from The Ordinary for less than $6/oz.\n\n**TL;DR: The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\nMy conclusion: There is nothing wrong with this product at face value since It is safe for most people to use. If cruelty-free products are important to you, I would not use this product until the company’s cruelty free status is verified. As far as retail value goes, there isn’t any reason for you to repurchase at the retail price, unless you love this stuff and you can afford it. For other people, a basic silicone-free gel moisturizer with niacinamide should give you similar results for a lower price point. You can make your own decision about whether you should use it, but now you are educated on what it is, and you hopefully have a better idea of what you’re putting on your body.",

I have used expensive face creams like Elizabeth Arden Prevage line and see benefits for the cost for that particular brand.  However, I agree that a good moisturizer doesn’t have to cost very much.  Follow the process of cleansing, toning, serum, exfoliating, moisturizer...the massaging of the skin in itself will show benefits!

    "body": "I wrote a really REALLY long [review of the CosRx Two in One Power Liquid](http://stylevanity.com/2018/04/cosrx-two-in-one-poreless-power-liquid-review.html) in my blog, so I honestly don't know where to start here. So I think, I'll just summarize each sections of my original review here for shorter and more convenient read.\n\n[The CosRx Two in One Poreless Power Liquid](https://preview.redd.it/tnq7r0d3b6011.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=664e3b6b9a9636fed4e0a3e0b820d798309b3965)\n\n## WHAT IS IT?\n\n**CosRx Two In One Poreless Power Liquid** is an oil\\-fighting liquid that claims to clear congested pores and tightens their circumference. It promises to deliver smoother skin and diminished pore size with consistent use. This also helps to cool down skin temperature and tames excessive oil production. And most importantly, it’s gentle enough to be used with other AHA or BHA products.\n\n## INGREDIENTS\n\nIt contains **0.1\\% BHA** to clear out congestion and deep\\-seated dirt. It’s also rich in **tannin** to tighten enlarged pores and features\\*\\* 88&#37; willow bark extrac\\*\\*t to fight acne and kill bacteria. The 0.1&#37; BHA here is a betaine salicylate NOT a salicylic acid which is more common.\n\n**APPLICATION**\n\nI apply this after cleansing and applying toner on my skin.  I dispense 2 pumps into my hand and pat onto the skin, avoiding the eyes and lips area. But take note, I learned that people with an allergy to aspirin will react poorly to the betaine salicylate.\n\nAnother way to use the Two In One Poreless Power Liquid is by [toner masking](http://stylevanity.com/2017/12/what-is-toner-mask.html), which I learned from CosRx Instagram. Because it is super mild, it is safe to leave on to your face for 5 minutes.\n\n**SCENT**\n\nI think this is supposed to be unscented, but I still detect a mild chemical scent in it just like in the CosRx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid.\n\n**FORMULA**\n\nJust like the other CosRx Power Liquids, this one also has a clear liquid formula that is a little bit thicker. It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not sting. I didn't felt any cooling sensation whenever I apply this using my hands, but with using a cotton pad and toner masking, that's when I felt it. I love using this for toner masking, but it's not cost efficient.\n\n**RESULT**\n\nAfter 2 weeks of using the CosRx Two In One Poreless Power Liquid, I could say that it really made my skin look smoother and the pores in *some areas* of my face shrunk.  I have little bumps on the sides of my nose as well, but they vanished too and completely free of blackheads.\n\nAlthough it contains “Salix Alba \\(Willow\\) Bark Water” and “Betaine Salicylate” which are acne\\-fighting ingredients, \\*\\*I didn’t find the Two in One Poreless Power Liquid can actually heal acne,\\*\\*especially cystic ones. You will need a different product for those. And this product doesn’t promise that anyway.\n\nI actually used this for toner masking, I leave it on for 5 minutes and felt a cooling sensation which feels so relaxing. After that my skin feels so smooth and look plumper, I woke up the next day and my skin still looks like that. And it’s already been over 12 hours and skin still looks smoother, plumper, less oily, and a little bit brighter. I highly recommend toner masking the Two in One Poreless Power Liquid if you have a big event the next day.\n\n## VERDICT\n\n**PROS:** It does not sting and safe to use with other actives like AHA, BHA, and PHA. It absorbs well into the skin and didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. The oil\\-control works on my skin as well and I didn’t experience purging. The claims that it deep cleans your pores are true. As for the pore minimizing, don’t expect a significant result but it happens.\n\n**CONS:** Personally, I haven’t found any cons. No bullsh\\*\\*\\*! But I have oily, acne\\-prone, and a little sensitive skin. And we all have different skin types. For those with dry skin, you may want to read Musing’s of A Muse review: [CosRX Two in One Poreless Power Liquid As Used by A Dry Skinned Girl](https://www.musingsofamuse.com/2018/05/cosrx-two-in-one-poreless-power-liquid-review.html).\n\nThis post was originally posted in [StyleVanity.com](http://stylevanity.com/2018/04/cosrx-two-in-one-poreless-power-liquid-review.html). You can read the full long review and see lots of photos in there.\n\n*\\*\\*I received the product mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog. Regardless, I only recommend products I use personally and believe will be good for the readers. All thoughts and opinions are my own and not influenced by the brand or its affiliates.*",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure.

    "body": "Sorry for the Large post, if interested, feel free to continue, but tl;dr: I lost 101lb.\n\nWell, on January 7th, 2018, I decided on a lifestyle change after my doctor stated I need to get on blood pressure medicine. I was 42 and I needed BP meds, yikes, it was a true come to Jesus moment. My starting weight was 327 pounds.\n\nAnd as of this morning, I weigh 225 pounds. I am still in shock, I still can’t believe it.\n\nPics [here](https://imgur.com/VMlCb6s), [here](https://imgur.com/yln8Pnj), and [here](https://imgur.com/zxhmqmt) with my chart progress [here](https://imgur.com/TqGT7Ng).\n\nThis sub has helped me so much answer some of my questions. So to give back, here are a couple things I learned about myself and/or if you're thinking low carb/Keto lifestyle:\n\n- Mentally, I had to switch from instant gratification satisfaction to the long, winding road of work. Que one year diet training montage-GO! *play Vince Dicola’s song from Rocky IV*.\n- My mind has not caught up to my body. I still look at myself like I am that fat guy, BigBear, former football lineman size. Now I am not, like, I lost my identity a bit. I know I have to work on myself to change that thought process.\n- I kinda look at myself in the eyes in the mirrors more, like I am finally not shaming myself\n- My ribs stick out, I mean WAY out. I am not sure if that will change. My daughter says she doesn’t like laying on my shoulder to go to sleep because it’s too boney. *Sux*.\n- I feel like I smile more, like annoyingly smilely. Maybe I like finally showing the dimples.\n- I feel like a switch happened talking to my clients in person or meeting new people, like a self-confidence acknowledgment. Though I fear it’s more that people are nicer to thinner people, comparing to what I have experienced in the last 30 years. Not cool but unfortunately it’s true.\n- I am cold ALL THE FRAKING TIME. I forgot I lost the insulation. Have hoodies.\n- Since I always have been big, I never have been big into clothes, always comfort over style. Now, I am kinda excited fitting into certain looks. I COLOR BLOCK like a boss... I went from a 48 tight waist to between 36 to 38, 2xl shirts to 75% Large/25% X-Large shirts. Even my wedding ring doesn’t fit (getting it resized). And yes, my shoe size dropped from 12” to 11.5”. I kept wearing clothes until my wife told me I look ridiculous, and then she bought cheap clothes as “transition”, pants at 46, 42, then 38. Didn’t buy all at once, which was smart.\n- I really never noticed I lost weight until Julyish, when I saw my family and they were like “DAAAnnnuumm”.\n- IT’S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO GO. Find that lifestyle, make it work, Keto just stuck with me.\n- Study up: Great You Tube video channels out there like Dr. Berg, Keto Connect, and Thomas DeLauer. Do it right. And yes, people will question your diet, saying its not the best diet, and you need to change it. Remember, everyone is different and what worked for others may not work for you. Do work, work hard, you do you. Show them by results.\n- There is a big difference between healthy Keto and dirty Keto. I started dirty, and I am now pretty clean now (4-5 cups of veggies a day, healthy organic proteins with good oils).\n- Some people have cheat times like vacations or special events. I didn’t. I believe that was one of the reasons I fell off the wagon so many times. I went strict, and yes, that frustrated my family and friends, but I feel it was good in the long term.\n- Log everything and measure food on a scale. Accountability. I had a great app on my phone that kept me attune to my CICO.\n- Bulletproof coffee (ghee, MCT oil, and coffee) is a thing; it’s awesome, it is a treat, not a requirement. But a good thing to take for energy.\n- My average day of eating is 3 eggs, cup or two of cooked spinach/kale, and sausage/bacon in morn/brunch. 9oz Chicken thighs with some franks hot sauce and 10 tbsp of sauerkraut for lunch, and 6oz beef protein of sorts with ghee, and one more cup of greens for dinner. Two to three cups of coffee w/ nutpod creamer a day. 64oz of water a day.\n- I can’t believe my grill survive this time. I meal prep every Sunday with over 7 pounds of meat a week. Went through 5 propane tank exchanges in a year.\n- Going out to eat can be a bummer unless it’s a steak house or bbq place. Big daddy burger’s burger salad bowl, Chipotle’s chicken lettuce bowl, or BW3 dry rub wings are all solid places.\n- Thank you scotch on the rocks for making me feel normal while hanging at parties.\n- I got and still get leg cramps and/or light headed, that’s lack of salts, magnesium, or potassium. It’s hard to balance and eat these naturally, so I add pink salt as well as typically take cod liver fish oil, Apple cider vinegar, betaine hcl, magnesium, garlic, clover, oregano-all Capsules form.\n- Food tips: Don’t waste bacon greese, meal prep to save money, Real Good Food pre-made meals (chicken crust pizzas or enchiladas) are perfect fit into this diet, power greens powder drink is a quick way to get greens in your diet, and cook down greens to condense to eat.\n- I have lactose, gluten, and IBS issues. Did Keto and 100lbs down help? Nope. Keto doesn’t solve all issues, but I do have no knee pain, back pain, or stomach acid issues anymore. I can breathe now tying my shoes. So, be humble.\n- Yes, working out helped even though I didn’t for the first five months. I mostly do cross trainer, elliptical, treadmill, around 33min tabata sprint/jogging and just Google DDP Yoga, pretty effective.\n- I didn’t talk about my diet much on social media or to friends/family. If people ask, I tell them that I do low carb, and if they prodded, then I talked keto if they wanted to hear. I am not much of a preacher. Again, humble and its not for them, its for me, self-accountability.\n- Yes, I am still on my diet, like to get close to 200 if I can, Maybe 199?!?.\n- And, Yes I have loose skin...everywhere. No plans for skin removal as of yet.\n\nI know that was a long list, but hopefully there was something in there that will teach or motivate someone that was in my position a year ago. I was nervous discussing this, being all kinds of vulnerable. But I was bless by my wife being a big source of encouragement. Thank you for listening and I wish you the best in your own adventures!\n\nEdit: Grammar the crap out of a sentence.",

You could cut out everything that’s not real, whole food (meat or veggies, butter, etc) and after a month start adding things back, one at a time, to see what you react to. Bone broth and 24-hour yogurt (you make it and ferment it for 24 hours - super probiotic and low-carb) would be very helpful, as would any other fermented foods.

Instead of a GI doc, why not try a functional medicine doctor? Some of them consult via SKYPE - Will Cole, for ex, who does the keto talk podcast with Jimmy Moore. People love to hate Moore, but Cole clearly knows his stuff and supports keto. A functional Med doc will work to get at the root cause vs just treating symptoms (which those drugs like Prilosec are about - killing symptoms and doing nothing to solve the real issue. You probably are well aware of that!).",

This should be pinned so people visiting the subreddit for the first time would know where to start with all their questions. \n\nI would add some form of probiotics on the list. Most people with GERD have a damaged stomach lining and the PPI’s could mess with your digestive system so the probiotics just help your body out a little more. It’s been helping me at least. \n\nChew your food thoroughly and take your time eating, it will help your body digests food better and can help prevent heartburn. \n\nEating bananas before breakfast or any meal helps “lubricate” the throat and esophagus and it’s alkaline aka one of the few fruits that aren’t acidic. \n\nFiber supplements or just eating more healthy greens in general. Since i was diagnosed with GERD and taking PPI’s I’ve been constipated and the extra fiber really helps. \n\nA lot of people tend to agree with trying to avoid drinking liquids during a meal, if possible try waiting 10 minutes after you’ve finished a meal to drink liquids in large gulps.",

My family got bankerupt.\n\n2) I'm a very hardworking girl who runs her own company and have always been super productive.\n\n3) I was having recurring sinus infections the entire year and have a deviated septum.\n\nPast symtoms: Severe Health anxiety, recurring sinus infections \n\nBy December I was very exhausted and fatigued.\nI went for a holiday and drank a lot in December ( The usual party month )  I came back and found on that my dad may be arrested. \n\nI started experiencing severe stomach pain and fatigue in the weeks after and I thought it would have happened because of partying too hard and alcohol in December. I started having bad constipation and found blood in my poop ( twice) \n\nNot the best thing for someone with health anxiety. My mom told me it was due to hemmoriids and not to worry. I was super anxious the entire month.\n\n- My stomach was gassy and painful and my dad spoke to a GI specialist who prescribed medicine at the same time.\n\n- I started having neck pain which was growing very slowly over the past year. A lot of my work is on the phone so my posture isn't the best and I was anyway going through so much stress.\n\n- My sinus infection was really bad in January and I had antibiotics.\n\n- By first week February I was having severe light headidness which hasn't gone till day.\n\n- I produce a lot of white thick phlegm. It's also foul smelling and all day in my throat.\n\n- my stomach still feels gassy\n\n- I have some rectom burning at times\n\n- my neck and shoulders are very stiff \n\nThe worst part is the constant light headidness and fatigue. It's like an imbalance which is always there.\n\n-I've had blood work and it's all clear. My internist thinks it's neck tension related has reffered me to a chiropractor. I've been going to the chriopractor and he said my muscles are very tense and it will take time to heal.\n\n- MY ent says I also have a problem with my eustachian tubes which causes constant pressure in my ears.\n\n- My stomach still feels weird but I haven't gone to a GI specialist due to Covid.\n\n- I've been to a neoruologist who says I'm fine and just anxious and very stressed. He's given me anti anxiety medicine which I haven't taken.\n\nIm only 26, this constant fear of feeling that o have some serious illness is scary. \nCan GERD cause all of the above?",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "This post is an attempt to provide a general answer to one of the most commonly asked questions on this subreddit: \"*I just got my Genetic Genie report...what does it mean??*\"\n\nI've tried to base this on reliable information, but it is inevitably incomplete, laced with opinion, and perhaps has errors. I welcome suggestions/corrections. Further, there may be interactions between SNPs that are unique to an individual, their life history, nutrition status, etc. that cannot possibly be addressed in such a general post.\n\nFinally, while [Genetic Genie](https://geneticgenie.org/) is a very handy tool and is free, it only analyzes a handful of SNPs. There can be many more SNPs that may be impactful for an individual. For those who wish to delve deeper, I recommend considering the following paid reports (each report will be in the 100-page range):\n\n* [Stratagene](https://www.seekinghealth.com/collections/strategene/products/strategene-report)  ([review](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/155qo9e/stratagene_report_review_some_pros_and_cons/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))\n* [Genetic Lifehacks](https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/)\n\n\n\nThe genes are listed in the order in which they appear in the Genetic Genie report.\n\nAlternate names for SNPs come from a) the rsID column of the Genetic Genie report, and b) [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) entries.\n\n\n\n# COMT\n\n* 'COMT' is short for 'catechol-o-methyltransferase'.\n* V158M alternate names: 472G>A, Val158Met, rs4680\n* H62H alternate names: 186C>T, rs4633\n* P199P alternate names: 597G>A, rs769224\n* COMT performs the breakdown of catecholamines; in particular, of dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and estrogen compounds.\n* Cofactors: magnesium, s-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)\n   * Maintain healthy levels of magnesium.\n   * Improve/maintain the methylation system (see other SNPs).\n* COMT regulates levels of [topic dopamine](https://youtu.be/IRQ4-lAeYJI&t=1951).\n   * One can think of **tonic dopamine** as providing the fairly constant baseline reference level of dopamine, whereas **phasic dopamine** is the brief sub-second pulse of dopamine due to some stimulus. [Phasic dopamine](https://youtu.be/IRQ4-lAeYJI&t=2037) is not regulated by COMT.\n   * If the tonic dopamine is low, then the phasic pulse will be large relative to the tonic level, and so the stimulus gets more attention. Behaviorally, this is someone who can have characteristics such as: being easily distracted, ADHD, more easily drops unpleasant thoughts, thrill seeker, potentially better under stress.\n   * If the tonic dopamine is high, then the phasic pulse will be small relative to the tonic level, and so the stimulus gets less attention. Behaviorally, this is someone who can have characteristics such as: able to concentrate on single topics, OCD, rumination, anxiety, worse under stress.\n   * If the tonic dopamine is intermediate, then the phasic pulse will be moderate relative to the tonic level, and so the stimulus gets a 'normal' amount of attention. Behaviorally, this is the someone who can be more balanced in their ability to respond or not to stimuli, who tends to neither ADHD nor OCD ends of the behavior spectrum.\n   * **NOTE**: COMT requires SAM, which is the primary output of the methylation cycle. If methylation output is low due to MTHFR or other issues, then COMT will work less efficiently at breaking down these neurotransmitters and thus tonic dopamine levels will be higher. (E.g., an intermediate COMT variant may act like a slow COMT variant, simply due to lack of SAM. Resolving the methylation issues will thus improve the COMT performance.)\n* V158M Green (-/-)\n   * This is often called \"fast COMT\".\n   * Dopamine/epinephrine/norepinephrine and other catecholamines are broken down at an accelerated rate, resulting in lower tonic dopamine levels.\n   * Some action steps if low tonic dopamine is a problem:\n      * Consider a higher protein diet to increase intake of tyrosine and phenylalanine. However, note that this may also increase intake of tryptophan which can be detrimental if one has slow MAO-A.\n      * Consider addition of catechols (such as quercitin, ECGC, fisetin, green tea, capers, cilantro, berries, apples) to occupy some of COMT's bandwidth.\n      * It may be that [higher iron and/or calcium levels could slow down COMT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3466255/).\n      * Consider supplementing tyrosine, which is the raw material for tyrosine hydroxylase, or supplementing Mucuna Pruriens (which contains L-Dopa). L-Dopa is the output product from tyrosine hydroxylase and is the precursor to tyrosine.\n      * NOTE: See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/18351lg/a_cautionary_tale/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for some potential issues with supplementing tyrosine or Mucuna Pruriens.\n      * Improve vitamin D status toward the higher end of the reference range.\n      * Maintain healthy levels of iron, vitamins B6, C.\n      * In the dopamine production pathway, tyrosine hydroxylase also depends on BH4, which comes from the biopterin pathway, and that pathway in turn also depends on GTP from the folate cycle. So, improving the folate cycle by addressing MTHFR will also help with BH4 production. BH4 production and utilization also needs healthy levels of B3, C, iron, zinc, and magnesium.\n* V158M Yellow  (+/-)\n   * Despite it showing yellow on the report, this COMT is actually 'normal'. About 45-50% of the population are V158M +/-.\n   * Your tonic dopamine levels are intermediate.\n* V158M Red  (+/+)\n   * This is often called \"slow COMT\".\n   * Dopamine/epinephrine/norepinephrine and other catecholamines are broken down at a reduced rate, resulting in higher tonic dopamine levels.\n   * Reduced breakdown of estrogen compounds can result in symptoms associated with excess estrogen or estrogen dominance.\n   * Some action steps for V158M Red:\n      * Most important is to improve methylation. This includes addressing MTHFR, MTR, B12 and folate status, and other SNPs not shown on Genetic Genie.\n      * See [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/202001/what-is-the-comt-gene-and-how-does-it-affect-your-health) for many good suggestions.\n      * If you are estrogen dominant, consider supplementing DIM, I3C, calcium-d-glucarate to reduce excess estrogen.\n      * It may be that [higher iron and/or calcium levels could slow down COMT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3466255/).\n      * Consider trying small (100-200mg) doses of supplemental SAMe, once/day or once/every few days. Once methylation status is improved, this may be unnecessary.\n* H62H - general\n   * This SNP and V158M together are a 'haplotype'. H62H will almost always be the same variant type as V158M. Therefore, refer to V158M.\n* H62H Red (+/+)\n   * According to [this paper](https://translationalneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40035-017-0081-9): \"*Both rs4633 TT \\[H62H Red (+/+)\\] and rs4680 AA \\[V158M Red (+/+)\\] encode the low activity COMT enzyme, which may decrease COMT activity and dopamine degradation*.\"\n   * Therefore, it appears the (+/+) variant would act as slow COMT. However, it is not clear if the impact of the H62H  (+/+) variant alone would be more, less, or similar to a comparable V158M (+/+) variant alone.\n* P199P\n   * [77-98%](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs769224) of people have the  Green (-/-) variant.\n   * I am unaware of any evidence that this SNP is impactful.\n\n\n\n# VDR\n\n* 'VDR' is short for 'vitamin D receptor'.\n* Consensus appears to be that Yellow or Red in **VDR Taq**, **VDR Bsm**, or **VDR Fok** indicate reduced vitamin D receptor activity.\n   * If any of these are Yellow or Red, consider improving your vitamin D status toward the higher end of the normal reference range.\n* **NOTE**: There is [some belief](https://www.heartfixer.com/AMRI-Nutrigenomics.htm#VDR%20Taq:%20%20Vitamin%20D%20Receptor%20Taq%20Abnormality) that VDR SNPs significantly affect tonic dopamine levels.\n   * Although it appears that tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme activity (which produces the dopamine precursor L-Dopa) will be improved by more optimal levels of vitamin D, it does not follow that more optimal levels of vitamin D will necessarily produce *excess* tonic dopamine.\n   * To avoid any potential issues, those with high tonic dopamine (due to V158M Red and/or poor methylation) may opt to address those issues first, prior to improving their vitamin D status.\n* **NOTE**: VDR is merely the last step in the sequence of steps to utilize vitamin D in its active form. There are several conversion steps that inactive vitamin D must go through to become active vitamin D, and those enzymes can have SNPs which downregulate them. The Genetic Lifehacks report mentioned at the top of the post will include these.\n\n\n\n# MAO-A\n\n* MAO-A is short for 'monoamine oxidase A'.\n* MAO-A alternate names: 891G>T, rs6323, R297R, Arg297Arg\n* MAO-A breaks down amines including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamines, tyramines, and also estrogen compounds.\n* The cofactor is B2.\n   * NOTE: Hypothyroidism can reduce conversion of riboflavin to the active forms FAD and FMN.\n* **NOTE**: Males only have one copy of MAO-A, thus Genetic Genie will report a single letter, e.g., 'G', instead of 'GG', for males.\n* Iron deficiency can impair MAO-A activity.\n* Be aware of MAO Inhibitors (MAOIs) which can impair MAO-A activity:\n   * Some prescribed drugs.\n   * [Natural MAOIs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35807542), such as turmeric, curcumin, quercetin, piperine, luteolin, apigenin, chrysin, naringenin, and others.\n* MAO-A R297R Green (-/-) or Yellow (+/-, TG)\n   * These are 'normal' variants.\n   * Maintain healthy B2 levels and healthy thyroid performance.\n* MAO-A R297R  Red (+/+, T or TT)\n   * This is often called \"slow MAO-A\".\n   * Maintain healthy B2 levels and healthy thyroid performance.\n   * You may find you are more susceptible to amines such as histamines or tyramines, especially  those with MAO-A Red. If so:\n      * Reduce or avoid high tyramine and/or high histamine foods.\n      * Consider DAO supplements to degrade histamines in the gut from bacteria and food.\n      * Maintain healthy iron, copper, vitamin C, magnesium, and calcium levels.\n   * Excess estrogen may also be an issue, especially if you also have COMT V158M Red.\n      * Consider supplementing DIM, I3C, calcium-d-glucarate to reduce excess estrogen levels.\n   * Resources:\n      * r/HistamineIntolerance subreddit\n      * [Histamine Intolerance Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/cr9pf6/histamine_intolerence_introduction_and_help_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) post\n   * Supplements I like:\n      * [Thorne Cal Mag Citrate + Vitamin C](https://www.amazon.com/Thorne-Research-Effervescent-Magnesium-Supplement/dp/B0797FBSKY)\n      * [Pure Encapsulations Copper Glycinate - 2 mg Copper Supplement](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7Y6J2)\n      * [NaturDAO DAO Enzyme Supplement - 1,000,000 HDU](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R5ZVG4L)\n\n\n\n# ACAT1-02\n\n* 'ACAT1' is short for 'acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1'.\n* ACAT1-02 alternate names:  rs3741049\n* I am unfamiliar with this SNP, and I refer you to:\n   * [Medline article](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/acat1/)\n   * [Blog post](https://www.myquinstory.info/know-your-genes-the-acat-gene/)\n\n\n\n# MTHFR\n\n* 'MTHFR' is short for 'methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase'.\n* MTHFR is the final enzymatic step in the conversion of food folate, folic acid, or folinic acid to methylfolate. If the methylation cycle were thought of as a gear that is turned by a crank handle, then methylfolate is the hand that turns the crank handle - with poor methylfolate status, the methylation cycle performs poorly.\n* The cofactor is B2.\n   * NOTE: Hypothyroidism can reduce conversion of riboflavin to the active forms FAD and FMN.\n* P39P\n   * P39P alternate name: rs2066470\n   * [74-95%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs2066470#frequency_tab) of people have the Green (-/-) variant.\n   * I am unaware of evidence that this SNP is impactful.\n* C677T and A1298C\n   * C677T alternate names: 677C-T, 677C>T, C665T, 665C>T, Ala222Val, rs1801133, C667T\n   * A1298C alternate names: 1298A-C, 1298A>C, 1286A>C, GLU429ALA, rs1801131, E429A\n   * These two SNPs can appear in different permutations of variants, which affect the performance of MTHFR.\n   * See [MTHFR: A Supplement Stack Approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1730mw4/mthfr_a_supplement_stack_approach/) for action steps for C677T and A1298C.\n   * Per the [table on Genesight](https://genesight.com/white-papers/what-is-the-clinical-significance-of-the-mthfr-a1298c-polymorphism/), the resulting percent of performance for the various combinations are:\n\n|Genotypes|677CC (-/-) \\[GG\\]|677CT (-/+) \\[AG\\]|677TT (+/+) \\[AA\\]|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1298AA (-/-) \\[TT\\]|100%|51-73%|22-32%|\n|1298AC (-/+) \\[GT\\]|69-92%|36-60%|n/a|\n|1298CC (+/+) \\[GG\\]|52-60%|n/a|n/a|\n\n* **NOTE**: MTHFR is only the last step in the folate conversion cycle. There can be SNPs in preceding enzymes such as MTHFD1 or SLC19A1 which may also degrade performance of the folate cycle.  The Stratagene report mentioned at top of post will analyze these SNPs. Also, Chris Masterjohn's free [Choline Calculator](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/how-much-choline-should-i-eat-the) will analyze MTHFD1 and SLC19A1 from your 23andme or Ancestry data.\n\n\n\n# MTR\n\n* 'MTR' is short for '5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase' or more commonly, 'methionine synthase' (MS).\n* MTR alternate names:\n* MTR is the enzyme which takes the methyl group donated by methylfolate and gives it to B12, which in turn gives the methyl group to homocysteine to convert homocysteine to methionine.\n* The cofactor is zinc.\n* Adequate methylfolate, B12 sufficiency, and adequate homocysteine levels are required for its operation.\n* [Adequate glutathione is also required](https://youtu.be/nR02eWsFK2I?t=6511) for MTR to work properly.\n   * See also: [Paper(2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3577685/), [Paper(2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017153/)\n* A2756G all variants:\n   * A2756G alternate names: 2756A>G, Asp919Gly, D919G:GAC>GGC, 2756A-G, rs1805087\n   * Maintain healthy zinc and B12 status.\n   * Address folate intake and any MTHFR issues.\n   * Maintain healthy methionine (e.g., protein) intake.\n   * Maintain homocysteine a healthy range (e.g., \\~5-8mcmol/L).\n\n\n\n# MTRR\n\n* 'MTRR' is short for '5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase'.\n* This is a low-activity repair enzyme for B12 that gets used by MTR.\n   * (It is typically stated that the methionine cycle 'spins' 18000 times/day, and that B12 needs repair roughly every 200 cycles. Therefore, MTRR is needed only \\~90 times/day, or an average of once every 16 minutes.)\n* The cofactors are B2, B3, SAM.\n   * NOTE: Hypothyroidism can reduce conversion of riboflavin to the active forms FAD and FMN.\n* MTRR - all SNPs and  variants:\n   * Maintain healthy B2, B3, and B12 status. Maintain healthy thyroid performance.\n   * SAM is the output of the methylation cycle, so address MTHFR and any other methylation issues.\n\n\n\n# BHMT\n\n* 'BHMT' is short for 'betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase'.\n* BHMT uses betaine (aka trimethylglycine or TMG) to convert homocysteine to methionine. This is an alternate path for conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which runs in parallel with the MTR path.\n* The cofactor is zinc.\n* BMHT - all SNPs and variants:\n   * Maintain healthy zinc, B2, B3, B6 to support BHMT and the upstream steps which convert choline to betaine. Maintain healthy thyroid performance.\n   * Maintain adequate choline intake. For this, see [MTHFR: A Supplement Stack Approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1730mw4/mthfr_a_supplement_stack_approach/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\n\n\n# AHCY\n\n* 'AHCY' is short for 'adenosylhomocysteinase'.\n* AHCY converts s-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to homocysteine, in the methionine cycle.\n* AHCY is alternatively called 'SAHH', short for  'S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase'.\n* The cofactor is B3.\n   * [This video](https://youtu.be/6-g-gCLa-xY) claims that magnesium and manganese are also needed. However, I cannot find anything elsewhere to substantiate this.\n* I do not know of any specific actions to take for this gene, aside from maintaining healthy B3 status.\n* For more info, I refer you to this paper: [Functional and Pathological Roles of AHCY](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044520/).\n\n\n\n# CBS\n\n* 'CBS' is short for 'cystathionine-beta-synthase'.\n* CBS is an enzyme which uses some homocysteine from the methionine cycle to another set of pathways (transsulfuration pathway), which include the creation of the important antioxidant glutathione.\n* The cofactors are B6, heme iron, serine.\n   * Serine comes from the diet or can be converted from glycine by the SHMT enzyme.\n* The reaction is activated by SAM.\n* CBS - all SNPs and all variants:\n   * Maintain healthy B6, iron, and serine levels.\n   * Maintain homocysteine a healthy range (e.g., \\~5-8mcmol/L).\n   * I am not aware of any good evidence that these SNPs are impactful.\n   * There may be issues further down the transsulfuration pathway which cause issues with sulfur intolerance and/or poor glutathione production, but that may require examination of other SNPs that are not on Genetic Genie. For that, I suggest the Stratagene report mentioned at top of the post.\n\n\n\n# SHMT1\n\n* 'SHMT1' is short for 'serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1'.\n* SHMT1 has a dual role in the folate cycle:\n   * Simultaneous reversible conversion of serine to glycine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) (the form after MTR takes away a methyl group from methylfolate) to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (the form needed by MTHFR).\n      * This pathway [provides 80-90% of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for MTHFR](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00351.2003?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org).\n   * The cofactor is B6.\n* C1420T - rs1979277 Red (+/+, AA) or Yellow (+/-, AG):\n   * Per [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3945%2Fjn.110.132506), these variants may sequester methyltetrahydrofolate, and may interact with a C677T variant (if present) resulting in reduced methylfolate available for methylation.\n* C1420T - all variants:\n   * Maintain healthy B6 status, and healthy glycine intake.\n   * I am unaware of any additional action steps to take.\n\n\n\n\n\nEDITS:\n\n* 20231010 - Corrected typo 'lower tonic dopamine' to 'higher tonic dopamine' for slow COMT.\n* 20231011 - Added bullet point about BH4 to fast COMT actions. Minor edits.\n* 20231011 - Added H62H \"slow COMT\" bullets.\n* 20231025 - Added alternate names (rsIDs and ClinVar names) to several SNPs.\n* 20231101 - Added glutathione requirement to MTR, with references.\n* 20231111 - Add SAHH alternate name for AHCY.\n* 20231120 - Add CBS cofactors serine & heme iron, and activator SAM.\n* 20231126 - Add Mucuna Pruriens for fast COMT, and link to post re potential tyrosine issues.\n* 20231128 - Add hypothyroidism comments for B2 cofactors. Add fast COMT catechol suggestions. Add iron/calcium comment to fast & slow COMT sections.\n* 20231226 - Add to resource links under MAO-A and ACAT1.\n* 20240203 - Add specific supplements to MAO-A. Add references on SHMT1.\n* 20240225 - Add iron deficiency as contributor to MAO slowdown. Add natural MAOIs list.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Long post ahead. I've tried to jot every basic thing that I've learnt. I've a used a para or two from a post by Aayu (her dad owns reddit btw) because I thought she phrased it good. I've included about things that I personally had experience with for this to be authentic but the word is \"mostly\" tho. So I hope this helps you. If you think I've misinformed anything, comment it down below.\n\nGetting started in Skincare can be overwhelming, what ingredients do what, what all are safe, what all are soothing, in what order should they be layered, at what frequency are they supposed to be used. Basically, there are too many questions, too much stuff to learn, and too little experience. So, I’ll tell you all about the things I’ve learned during the last 10+ months and if you can avoid the mistakes I’ve done, this article would have served its purpose and can rest in peace.\n\nA little disclaimer: while I’d like to think of myself as a person that does quite decent research no matter what the subject, I’d like you to take my advice with a pinch of salt. Do your own research thoroughly before you add a product into your routine.\n\r\nSo, since this is a dummies guide I’ll try and help you make a routine for yourself. I’ll add my advice at the end, based on experience and I hope this would be your greater take away as the rest info can be found anywhere online. And by no means do I mean you guys are dummies btw.\n\r\nFirstly, let’s address why skincare? As much as we’d like our life to be a perfect bubble, we know that it isn’t the case. Skincare can help every single type of skin. Your skin breaks out? Sure, we can do something about it, you get dry patches on your skin? Sure, we can manage that too, you have no problem with skin whatsoever? We can help your skin be that way till your friends are all old and wrinkly. The idea of skincare is just to provide what it needs for it to remain in a zen state by keeping it happy.\n\r\nYour skin can just do fine with as basic a routine as Cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Rest all is needed for that extra push if you will. Skin, as fascinating and self-sufficient a thing it is, sometimes needs help to function properly.\r\nLet’s tackle this baffling thing that skincare is by focusing on one product at a time.\n\r\nI loved this paragraph that has been put together by AsainBeauty on Reddit.\n\r\n>Understanding what works for you and making informed purchases are a bit of a chicken-and-egg conundrum seeing as you won’t know your skin until you start using a routine, and you won’t know what to purchase until you know your skin! That being said, there are a lot of products out there that work for the majority of people and maybe safe initial purchases, based on your skin type and skin concerns. There may be a perfect product out there for you, but it may take some time to find it as you will have to figure out what specific ingredients your skin likes, which ones it can’t deal with, and which ones are just meh.\n\r\n##***Cleanser***\r\nWe all know that our face similar to our body needs washing too. So, whenever you’re choosing a cleanser make sure it is as gentle as it can be. It shouldn’t be over stripping no matter what. If you have a squeaky clean face after you wash your face and you feel like “ oh my face seems to be pretty clean now, in your face dirt and bacteria ha!, I won’t let you become a zit on my face today” then you’re in trouble.\r\nAs we know our skin, being an intelligent thing that it is, normally produces oil for preserving itself. But when your face is over cleaned, if that’s a word, your skin rings the emergency alarm and asks for more oil production. So now you might feel like your face is greasy all day long. If you’re a dry skin person then guess what you’re in for more trouble. So, it’s important to choose something that doesn’t strip away your natural oil. I’d advise staying away from the whole anti-acne facewash lines we have, as none of them actually benefit you. Your facewashe should have a pH between 4.5 to 7. pH of products is important for maintaining skin barrier integrity, your skin has an acid mantle (protective barrier on the surface of skin composed of sweat, skin oils, and dead skin cells) that gives it its pH value. This mantle is a thin layer on your skin that protects you from bacteria, virus, fungi making it soft and supple, disrupting this layer can cause effects like inflammation, dermatitis, dry and dehydrated skin. Pollution, pathogens, cleansers, soaps and even water might disrupt your mantle, so it’s important for your cleanser to have a low pH so that it doesn’t make your skin squeaky clean. I know I just complicated the shit out for something like a cleanser, but don’t worry you’ll find a ton of recommendations for cleansers in that pH range.\n\r\nAnd 60 seconds should be the max time you should spend washing your face.\n\r\nYour typical face cleansers are actually used as a second cleanser. There is actually an oil-based cleanser that people use to remove the dirt, make-up, pollution, sunscreen at the end of the day. You can’t actually use oil for this purpose as there’s a risk of it remaining on the skin, even after the second cleanse, and therefore clogging your pores. Oil Cleansers or micellar water or cleansing balms are the better choices for first cleansing as they have emulsifiers that breakdown the oil and therefore helping you remove dirt and makeup along with oil. You might actually be fine without incorporating the first cleanser but many people often report that it actually made a difference, helping them.\r\nYou can skip cleansers in the morning and it might actually benefit you, remember how we talked about stripping your face of Its natural oils.\n\r\nSome loved and affordable products: Cetaphil Gentle cleanser, Simple refreshing Facewash.\n\r\n##***Moisturizer***\r\nThis is just more of a trial and error sort of thing. Just choosing a moisturizer with non-comedogenic ingredients (pore-clogging ingredients) would be fine. Oily skin people can like gel textured moisturizers, dry skinned people can benefit from something thick. Typically, the thicker the product, the more moisturizing it is. If you’re oily I’d advise you to stay away from all-natural moisturizers as they usually have too many oils in them and they might clog your pores and you might end up with closed comedones (or clogged pores). There are three things in moisturizers emollients, occlusives, humectants. Emollients provide your skin with required moisturization helping your lipid barrier (your skin has lipids and ceramides and all kinds of stuff) therefore keeping it healthy, Oils, shea butter, ceramides are examples of emollients you can find. Humectants bring moisture to your skin from air thus preventing your skin from getting dry, Glycerin and hyaluronic acid are two main used Humectants. Occlusives prevent water loss from your skin, oils, silicones, dimethicone, mineral oils are examples of occlusives you can usually find in products. These three in a moisturizer can help your skin restore its skin barrier therefore keeping it healthy and happy while minimizing the possibility for irritation.\r\nThings to consider when evaluating how well your moisturizer works:\r\n•\tDoes it leave your skin feeling bouncy and supple? Happy and healthy, not dry and tight, is what a good moisturizer is aiming for.\r\n•\tHow long does that moisturized feeling last? If it only lasts an hour or two, you may want to find a different moisturizer! Perhaps try a thicker moisturizer, like a cream or a balm.\r\nIf your moisturizer is gentle enough, doesn’t break you out, and does what it’s supposed to do, that’s awesome! Go ahead and enjoy it as part of your skincare routine :). If it turns out that your product irritates your skin, gives you acne, or doesn’t do what it should, it might be time to try a different one!\n\r\n##***Sunscreen***\r\nIt’s the most important step period. Whatever you might be doing to your skin, if you aren’t using sunscreen it would all be a waste.\n\r\nSunscreen has the following benefits:\r\n•\tReduces the risk of skin cancer\r\n•\tPrevents hyperpigmentation\r\n•\tReduces signs of aging\r\n•\tProtects against signs of photodamage (fine lines, etc.)\r\n•\tPrevents burns (dark-skinned people aren’t affected much)\n\r\nThings to remember before buying sunscreen:\r\n1. The more the SPF the better it is.\r\n2. It should be waterproof\r\n3. It shouldn’t break you out obviously\r\n4. I’d advise you to stay away from the whole natural line again.\r\n5. If you have dark skin, avoid sunscreens with high percentages of physical filters (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) as they’ll lend a white cast to your skin. Chemical sunscreens are your best bet.\r\n6. If you have sensitive skin, you may prefer to look for an all physical sunscreen or a physical/chemical combination sunscreen — chemical filters (Oxybenzone, Avobenzone, typically organic ingredients) may cause stinging and irritation for some people.\n7. The higher the Pa+++ rating the better protection you get.\n\r\nKorean Sunscreens (from CosRx and Purito perhaps) are great, they tend to be moisturizing while providing an adequate amount of sun protection\n\r\nThis is it for people that usually have healthy skin or normal skin, from here on you can make your skin better but you’d have to be careful with giving your skin that extra push for dealing with aging, pigmentation, scarring, etc. I’m all up for it, if I can better myself in any way possible, and achieving great things always involves a tad bit of risk as you’d be treading in unfamiliar territory. You can minimalize the risk by studying more about it and all things worth having require effort now, don’t they? I’m just making it sound dramatic because I messed up and I don’t want you to mess up.\n\r\nAfter following a basic routine for a few months and building a healthy skin barrier, you can start adding actives to your routine that benefit you and up your skincare game a notch. But do not enter the actives zone unless you’ve found a good Cleanser, moisturizer, and Sunscreen routine. After nailing your basic routine wait a month or two before introducing a new product and introduce a single product at a time. Be patient skincare takes time to show any results.\n\r\n##*Let’s talk actives now.*\n\r\n***AHAs:*** Alpha hydroxy acids or it is called, are exfoliating agents that work on surface-level helping you clear out tiny bumps on your skin (CCs). AHAs brighten your skin too helping with hyperpigmentation as they work on the surface level. Even though using acids on your skin sounds terrifying, don’t worry much they are well-researched ingredients and do wonders to your skin. Glycolic acid, Lactic acid (Milder), Mandelic acid (Milder) are commonly found ingredients.\n\r\n***BHAs:*** BHAs are oil-soluble ingredients so they work at the pore level. The soak up the oil clogging the pore that was about to become a pimple. These help people with acne a lot. Salicylic acid, betaine salicylate (Milder) are commonly found ingredients.\n\r\n***PHAs:*** PHAs are really mild ingredients and can be very well treated by people with sensitive skin.\r\nAll these ingredients are exfoliating ingredients that are naturally derived (from almonds, sugarcane, beets, etc;) and can be found in various formulations and products like toners, essence, moisturizers, sometimes cleansers (but these make very less difference as they don’t sit on your face longer). Start with the smallest percentage you can find and start introducing it once a week. No matter what the product says, don’t start anything with the recommended usage. Start bringing it into your routine by using it once a week for a month or so and then increase it to twice a week. You can really irritate your skin if you aren’t careful enough. Be patient, they’ll help you.\n\r\n***Over exfoliation:*** This is a thing and if you happen to do this, that is exfoliate more than you are supposed to, your skin is going to freak the F out. You’ll damage your skin barrier, deal with more breakouts, your skin will remain red for long periods of time so don’t overuse a product that you have never used before. (I’ve had to deal with this btw)\n\r\n***Niacinamide:*** This is an active form of vitamin B3 that helps with pigmentation, sebum production and therefore reducing the size of your pores. This ingredient is really well tolerated by everyone and often is referred to as a holy grail ingredient.\n\r\nNow the I haven’t had experience with ingredients like vitamin C, Retinoids, Azelaic acid, and others yet and so I can’t speak from personal experience but research them thoroughly if you’d want t get into them. They can make your situation worse if you don’t use them carefully. Since I’m a dummy too I’d want to stay away from them for now.\n\r\n***Purging:*** Also learn about purging. Whenever you’re introducing any actives your skin becomes worse before it gets better (worse as in you’ll deal with more than you usually do, so it changes from person to person). Purging is only possible if you are using products with active exfoliants, such as AHAs, BHAs, scrubs, peels, or retinoids. Why? Because exfoliation causes your skin to push the blockages inside of it out to the surface. Therefore, you can’t really “purge” from using a new moisturizer or new sunscreen. If you feel like you are “purging” after using a new moisturizer (or new product without any actives), you are probably just breaking out from the product. This usually lasts for a few weeks. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UD2eRiflNI) to know more.\r\n\r\nAlso, here’s a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/expanding_your_routine) on adding products I found recently that might help you.\n\r\n##***Skin Concerns***\r\nFirst knowing what skin type you have, helps a lot. Go through this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vic-EMOivpA) and then you can understand what might help your skin.\r\n\r\nLet’s get through skin concerns now and let’s begin with the most common issue “Acne”.\n\r\nOily skin people usually have to deal with acne compared to dry skin people. The frustrating thing about acne is there isn’t a single thing you can point out to be the potential cause. There are literally a ton of factors that can trigger acne. So, first, let’s understand why you breakout.\r\nOur skin is made up of pores right and these pores usually have hair follicles, and there are sebaceous glands in these pores that produce oil to nourish your skin and the follicle. But we being humans we shed skin cells quite often and this is called skin cell turnover (about 50% of the dust around you comprises of dead skin cells). Sometimes when too much oil is produced or too many dead skin cells are shed our pores usually make a cocktail of oil and dead skin cells blocking our pores and these are clogged pores. There’s this bacteria called p.acne that enters this cocktail sometimes to party, and when our body detects this invasion it sends white blood cells to fight them off and it becomes this pus-filled pimple. Lack of sleep, stress, hormones, food, etc. can also trigger acne from inside messing up the oil production and skin cell turnover.\n\r\n###***Regulating Sebum Production:***\r\n1. Look out for ingredients like Niacinamide, green tea.\r\n2. Moisturize your skin so your skin doesn’t have to.\r\n3. Use a cleanser that isn’t over stripping.\r\n4. Include facial oils to lock in the moisture, it really can be a game-changer. Look out for oils with high linoleic acid like Rosehip oil or squalene as they are light on the skin. (oils high in oleic acid can help dry skin by providing sufficient nourishment as they tend to be rich).\n\r\n###***Managing dead skin:***\r\n***Exfoliants:*** Exfoliation is the way to help our skin with managing its skin cell turnover. You might be familiar with scrubs we usually find in the market. Scrubs are labeled under physical exfoliation. Even though people have been using physical exfoliation for a long time, it is actually proven to be not skin-friendly. The grains in scrubs usually cause micro-tears in your skin and might aggravate aging. Also, avoid scrubs if you have breakouts on your face, or maybe just avoid the region you have the breakout. If it’s cut open it might lead to further inflammation, pigmentation and makes you more susceptible to have another breakout. If you are choosing physical exfoliation make sure the grains are as tiny as possible. I actually find chemical exfoliators beneficial and safe. About which I’ve added in the Actives section.\r\n***Pigmentation:***\r\nThere’ two types of Pigmentation. One is PIE the other is PIH. PIE is the red spot you usually have after the pimple situation. It is usually red as vessels below the skin are damaged. If you further irritate your skin or expose it to sunlight your skin triggers melanocytes to produce more melanin to save keratinocytes, therefore resulting in PIH. This is the dark spot that you see after the pimple situation.\r\nPigmentation takes months to heal so your best bet is to prevent it from happening. So, what can you do to prevent it? Firstly, stop picking at your pimples. It just irritates your skin and more irritation equals more damage which equals more recovery time. Don’t go under sunlight if you don’t have sunscreen on. It is generally advised to wear sunscreen even though you are indoors. If you don’t wear sunscreen with enough SPF, there’s no point in doing any sort of treatment for those spots. It would all just be a moo point. So, wear sunscreen kids.\n\r\nFor reduction of pigmentation, you can add niacinamide, AHAs, Vitamin C, azelaic acid to your routine. But sunscreen first.\n\r\n###***Dry skinned beauties:*** \nDry skinned people are usually more susceptible to aging so, it’s really important to hydrate and moisturize your skin. You can add ingredients like Hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and choose moisturizers that are usually thick in consistency. Also, add toners and essences for hydration. You can also lookup slugging online. Follow Charlotte Palermino on Instagram for advice.\n\r\n#***Advice from experience***\r\nI had to learn these things the hard way as I f’d up way too much and I literally gambled with my skin, which I strongly advise you against btw. I was just an idiot honestly, hope you take away these things.\n\r\n1. Asian beauty over everything: This is just a personal preference actually as they usually tend to be really really mild and beginner-friendly.\n\r\n2. Keep your skin happy. Do not irritate it no matter what. If you find that something is irritating your skin dump it no matter how much you’ve paid for it or just use it on your body. Also, keep your routine really simple. The more products you add the more you are susceptible to irritation and the less you’ll know what might have caused it.\n\r\n3. Don’t underestimate the damage products can do. Introduce any sort of product with caution, always stay on the back foot. Introduce anything in small amounts. You don’t need a ton of ingredients and products to have healthy skin, keep it simple, and only introduce products according to needs.\n\r\n4. Always always always start with the least potent product you can find, to help your skin get used to it.\n\r\n5. No essential oils. Essential oils do more bad than good usually. They might trigger serious irritation, speed up aging. No tea tree oil topical application and all, trust me on this. There were way better ingredients out there that you can experiment with.\n\r\n6. No fragrance can be the way to go if you can find it. Usually, companies don’t disclose the ingredients they’ve used for fragrance and so some ingredient present in there might trigger irritation.\n\r\n7. If you find a red spot you see before the pimple pops up, it usually means something irritated your skin and now it is Inflamed. Spot treating it with pure aloe vera gel helps a ton. You can try wow 99% aloe gel (the only product I trust enough from wow btw).\n\r\n8. STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE.\n\r\n9. Pimple popping isn’t worth the shit you have to deal with later at all.\n\r\n10. Give your product some time. Sometimes it might not be the product that irritated your skin so don’t jump on that trigger quick.\n\r\n11. No product is going to change your skin overnight, there is no miracle product out there. So, stop being impatient and using it more than you can handle. There is nothing called overnight transformation. No face mask will resolve all your issues. Rome was not built in a day. Skincare is an everyday habit, consistency is a must. Sometimes breakouts/purging can cause you a lot of anxiety. This can make you go overboard and cause more harm than good. Please be patient with your skin and trust the process.\n\r\n12. Don’t be too harsh on yourself, dealing with acne can be hard and takes a toll on our mental health. Just remember it doesn’t define you and you can do something about it.\n\r\n13. With great power comes great responsibility. The ingredients you find people mentioning online that made a difference for them can be really good but if you don’t use them carefully, you might have to deal with more.\n\r\n14. Skincare is a marathon, not a race. Remember that the efforts you’re putting in will benefit you in long term.\n\r\n15. Start reading the ingredients list, you’ll eventually know why there is a specific ingredient in there with time. Use https://incidecoder.com/ to read the ingredient label before purchasing a product.\n\r\n16. Only move to the next product if you’re sure that the current one you’re using doesn’t irritate you.\n\r\n17. Listen to your skin, not to reviews not to YouTubers. Monitor & observe your skin closely. If some advice is producing negative results even after consistent efforts, no matter how many people claim the advice is working for them, drop it, and vice versa. Learn to observe what causes your skin to react positively/negatively. People are paid to make reviews online if you have a channel on YouTube or they sed products free of cost for them to review (barter) so don’t take reviews too seriously unless you trust the source. (primarily wow and mama earth).\n\r\n18. NO DIY. Some natural things that are safe to put on your face are honey, aloe vera, tomato masks now and then for brightening(it has lactic acid in it), and you can spot treat pimples with a mixture of turmeric and milk. Don’t overdo any of these either.\n\r\n19. Sleep early ( I can’t seem to do this but it literally changes your skin game), stay hydrated, change pillow covers often, wash your towels, so basically make sure everything that comes into contact with your skin is clean.\n\r\n20. We are all different. Our skin is not the same. Our environment is not the same. Our genes are not the same. What may be too much for me maybe too little for you and, vice-versa. Please patch-test before you try any new product.\n\r\n21. Skincare YouTubers and Instagrammers: Beauty Within, Liah Yoo, James Welsh, Cassandra Bankson, Hyram, Lab muffin, Samapti Banerjee, Charlotte Palermino, Gothamista, these are some people that I follow.\n\r\nEnjoy the process, enjoy taking time for yourself. Happy skincare people.\n\r\nCredits: Reddit: r/skincareaddicts, r/Asianbeauty, r/indianskincareaddicts.\n\nEdit: Adding a previous post of mine\n\nSkincare is a journey, so here's some things that help improve your skin quite a bit.\n\n**1. Sleep:**  Sleep is such an affecting factor when I look back. When I was in college I used to sleep at around 4-5 am (just being a normal millennial I guess) and my skin was bad most of the time, there were several other factors that contributed to it too but sleep was definitely one. I realised this recently when I had been in a motorcycle accident and had to have surgery. After the surgery I used to sleep at around 12-1 am and during the initial stages of my recovery and my skin rarely if ever broke out. So yeah even though it's hard to put your phone down missing out on watching those food videos and all just remind yourself you need to have better at any cost.\n\n**2. Pillow covers and Bed sheets:** If you've ever heard any Youtuber talk about this trust them it's true. When I had the accident I told you about I broke my collarbone, So I couldn't turn around when I'm asleep so my face was never in contact with the bed during the night and as a result my face was clear. I was able to pin this down when I started recovering. I  could sleep on my right side (collarbone is broken on the left side) after a while and in a few days my face started to break out on my right side. It was weird kind of, no spot on my left side but a few pimples on my right. So yes Bed sheets and pillow covers do matter. I don't use a pillow but I don't change the bedsheet regularly being the lazy 21 yr old I am, So I try sleeping on my back most of the time. But this isn't effective all the time, so sheets do matter.\n\n**3. Water:** Come on now what problem do you have with drinking water, just drink plenty of water everyday and stay hydrated. You have literally nothing to lose and everything to gain so just drink your damn water.\n\n**4. Digestion and Bowel movement:** Include more fibre into your diet for better digestion. Have a big glass of warm  water after you wake up empty stomach, it really helps. A healthy gut results in healthy skin.\n\n**5. Diet:** Stay away from sugar, unhealthy fats, Dairy products. Include healthy fats that are rich in omega 3 like walnuts, egg yolks, flax and chia seeds, and sea food if you're a non vegetarian. My skin quality was always poor , I get strech marks even with the slightest change in my body, so I started adding omega 3 religiously although I don't know if it's made any difference.\n\n( Maintain moderation in diet and you'll be fine)\n\n**6. Don't touch your face:** It's so hard not to do this but this might be a game changer. No matter how much you want to touch the pimple that's gonna pop out in a day or two refrain from doing it. If you have to touch because it's itching or for some other reason wash your hands properly before hand. I've become too conscious of this recently, I use my right index finger for whenever I need to touch my face. So I avoid touching anything with this finger and it kind of seperates itself on it's own whenever I'm using my hands. Wash your hands at all costs before touching your face.\n\n**7. Keep your hair clean:** This way you can reduce the acne around your hair line.\n\n**8. Don't irritate your skin:** Learning to listen to your skin a great skill imo. I never understand if the product is bad or it's just purging and I end up irritating my skin most of the time. I don't understand when my skin is agitated , might be because I don't observe enough, but don't over use anything and stress your skin, any product takes a bit time to show any result. Skin care is a marathon kind of thing, results won't appear instantly so embrace this journey and keep learning :-)\n**9. Your facial oil is good:** It's just produced to retain the moisture on your face. Don't strip it away to get a squeaky clean feeling after you wash your face, this'll just result in more oil production and as a result P. acne gets more feed. \n\n**10. Use a Clean Towel:** It's comes in contact with your face so there's no need to stress on how important it is for your towels to be clean. Or if you have the patience just air dry your face.\n\n>*So focus on getting your basics right because if you don't get these right no amount of skin care products can help.*",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.\n\nSo I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467087\n\n#What is hair?\n\n>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*\n\n>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*\n\n[Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1083/7638/files/Hair-Anatomy-e1421050694589.png?v=1505924657)\n\n\n#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?\n\nOver time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.\n\nPrior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.\n\nIn recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.\n\nMost proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.\n\n#How does shampoo work?\n\nThe main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is \"create suds\" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.\n\n>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* \n\nWhat this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.\n\nSurfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.\n\n[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) \n\n* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.\n 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate\n 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate\n 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate\n 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.\n\n* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.\n\n* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.\n\n* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.\n\nAll shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word \"sulfate\", though)\n\nHigh end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.\n\n#####How often should I shampoo?\n\nYou probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n#The benefit of conditioner\n\nModern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.\n\nThe solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. \n\nA conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. \n\n>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*\n\nConditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:\n\n* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner\nPolymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)\n\n* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)\n\n* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]\n\n* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.\n\nThe big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.\n\nLike all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.\n\n*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.\n\n#How to wash and condition your hair.\n\nThe way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.\n\nShampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. \n\nOnce the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.\n\nLeaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.\n\nAfterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. \n\n(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)\n\n#TL;DR?\n\n* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. \n\n* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\n* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. \n\n* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.\n\n* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.\n\n* The key to good hair care is not going \"no poo\" or \"sulfate/silicon free\", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I believe your statement to be true that sulfates themselves wont stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. However, washing your hair too often will substantially raise the rate at which your scalp produces oil and thus the rate at which your hair gets greasy. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that when you wash your hair and scalp, you'll also inevitably stimulate the skin in that area, creating friction which results in more blood flow that will make the sebaceous glands \"work better\". The second reason is that by washing your hair you'll also remove the oil from your scalp. Leaving your skin in a dry condition. Dry skin will make your sebaceous glands work overtime to fix exactly that problem, as their main function is to lubricate and waterproof your skin. \n\nTldr: Don't wash your hair too often, it will get your hair greasy fast. It can also cause dandruff in the long term by overstimulating the sebaceous glands.\n\nSource: Studied hairdressing and am a barber.",

    "body": "Howdy,\n\nI mentioned this formula in a couple of comments on other posts and figured this would probably be the best way to share with everyone.\n\nFirst things first. Here's the formulation...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ingredient|Dose (mg)|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)|1000||\n|Agmatine Sulfate (AS)|1000||\n|Trimethylglycine|1000|Betaine Anhydrous, not Betaine HCl|\n|Curcumin|1000|Phytosome preferred|\n|Dihydromyricetin (DHM)|1000|Beta-cyclodextrin complex preferred|\n|Milk Thistle|500|Phytosome preferred|\n|Boswellia|500|Phytosome preferred|\n|Glycine|1000||\n|L-Theanine|200||\n|N-AcetylCysteine (NAC)|1000|Can also use L-Cysteine / N-acetylcysteine amide|\n|Taurine|500||\n|Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)|500||\n|Tyrosine|500||\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, I apologize in advance for the weird formatting. Shit saved differently than I had it, and it's like dealing with old school Microsoft word. Painful.\n\nNow then, this formulation can be taken before or after drinking. NAC had one study showing that it increased damage to the liver if taken after intoxication. It was in one study. Literally one, and not a very good / complete one at that. However, I'm not a fucking doctor, so make your own informed choices. I can send the research papers I used for NAC specifically, as well. I have taken this formulation before drinking and after drinking, and it works incredibly well. It has also worked incredibly well for the friends I have shared it with. Literally, every single person has told me this has dramatically reduced their hangovers mentally and physically. From my testing, this formulation is good for about 6 to 8 drinks for a 180lb male. You may have to experiment to get your dosing right for your own body.\n\nThis is a conglomeration of interviews I took from folks who tried it. When taken before drinking, you may notice that you do not get drunk in the same way as you would expect. For starters, you hardly notice the physical effects. You feel the buzz you get after the first drink or two, and it stays with you for the night. You just feel very calm and in control of yourself, more social and outgoing. Just comfortable. You also don't 'need' a drink in your hand at all times. The anxiety to have another is not nearly as strong.\n\nIf taken after, you can toss this in your mouth and wash it down with your beverage of choice. If using the phytosome and betacyclodextrin complexes, the mixture will be relatively water soluble. I threw it in a workout mixer thing with water and downed it. The taste isn't awful but could be better. A bit of juice makes it hardly noticeable.\n\nThere you have it. Here's what I'll cover in the next two parts of this post:\n\n1. Research behind this - effects of alcohol, how these ingredients counteract or help these effects, and other ingredients that could also be included. General summaries of each ingredient above + other ingredients I opted not to include.\n2. A bit of background about why I made this. I'll avoid talking about any business stuff, as I don't want this to be taken as an astroturfing post. Basically no business has been made around this, and won't be for the foreseeable future due to difficulty sourcing betacyclodextrin DHM and reasonable manufacturers.\n\n# The Research:\n\nWe are going to start with booze and how your body deals with it. This is the basic metabolism process that needs to be understood. There are major offshoots not covered in this, but not terribly important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Alcohol Metabolism](https://preview.redd.it/fxp9a75l57d71.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=78ca9f7b21e0bf46d49d89252729d432b47729af)\n\nNow, within this metabolism process the major culprit of most damage to the body and brain is with acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a \\*\\*very\\*\\* reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been linked to almost every negative effect you can imagine from face flushing to crippling addiction. Within this metabolism process, the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde is relatively quick (Enzyme - Alcohol Dehydrogenase - ADH), while the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate (Enzyme - Alcohol Dehydrogenase - ALDH) is much slower. Acetate isn't as big of a problem and tends to be cleared in step with concentrations of taurine - more on that later.\n\nYou may have heard of the Asian Glow. It refers not just to your homie that has one beer and loses it entirely, but mainly to a genetic mutation in the ALDH II enzyme that greatly reduces its activity. In short, people with this mutation build up acetaldehyde way quicker than someone without. This causes them to suffer worse hangovers from seemingly inconsequential amounts of alcohol as well as many other fun effects that you tend to only get from really hitting the sauce hard.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nYour body, being the insanely adaptive piece of genius that it is will tend to get better and better at processing alcohol - usually at the expense of other processes. Your friends that drink every weekend into oblivion probably have an easier time getting over a hangover than the guy or gal that only drinks a few times or once in a blue moon. Or put more succinctly \"Hangovers are substantially more common in light-to-moderate drinkers than in heavier drinkers - possibly because the body hasn’t adapted to chronic alcohol injury. \"\n\nHere's another couple tidbits I found interesting from my research: hangover severity is inversely correlated to testosterone levels. This may be the reason that hangovers get progressively worse as we get older, as our hormone levels naturally level off and begin to drop. Oddly enough, testosterone levels will go up while drinking, but crash, with an increase in estrogen, once your BAC drops.\n\nAcetaldehyde has been shown to be 10 to 1000x more addictive in terms of dopamine release than ethanol in multiple animal models. People aren't alcoholics, they are acetaldehydics or however that term would end up.\n\nHere are the overall categories of effects from alcohol:\n\n1. ROS and RNS damage - inflammation, neuroinflammation, lipid peroxidation.\n2. The antioxidant enzyme, cofactor, and substrate depletion.\n3. Mitochondrial damage + dysfunction\n4. Endocrine system hormonal system out of wack (Lower T, Higher E)\n5. Neurotransmitter dysfunction (GABA, Glutamate, Dopamine, Serotonin, Acetylcholine)\n6. Decrease in insulin sensitivity (like diabetes) - metabolism\n7. Sleep Cycle disruption\n8. Immune system suppression\n\nIf we were to summarize this... A hangover is like having a temporary bout of anxiety, diabetes, and Alzheimers.\n\nMajor physical effects - low energy, fucked up metabolism, skin break outs, etc. tend to be caused by the exhaustion of antioxidant enzymes. Your body prioritizes using them to clear alcohol and all its metabolites that tend to react with acetaldehyde at the expense of essentially every other process that keeps you feeling good.\n\nMajor mental effects - anxiety, wanting to do stuff that gives you a quick dopamine boost like eating shit food or watching (adult) cartoons all day, having zero motivation. These are all neurochemical imbalances. The largest is GABA/Glutamate balance getting fucked up. When you drink, GABA goes up and glutamate goes down. This gives you a feeling of relaxation and ease. Arguably why you find it easier to speak to crowds of folks if you'd normally be shitting yourself nervous. During withdrawal / hangovers, this is reversed. GABA goes down, glutamate goes up. It makes you hypersensitive and anxious. It is hard to focus because everything draws your focus. Withdrawal starts the moment your BAC starts dropping. Yes, so literally after the first drink. And it will get worse as you keep going. On top of this, your normal feel-good neurotransmitters - dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine - get depleted. So you wake up after boozing, and you're running low on happiness or whatever the chemical equivalent is. Guh. These imbalances will also make it difficult to sleep the night of drinking and even a night or two after.\n\nFor major alcoholics, the above anxiety can be absolutely crippling. And... alcohol delivers instant GABA boost which is then dopamine reinforced. Brutal. Your brain will actually start to produce less GABA as you slide into alcoholism, making it extremely difficult to get rid of this anxiety after drinking.\n\n# Supplements:\n\nI'll start with summaries on the ones I included, then give a brief summary of others that help the categories above. Feel free to shoot me a DM or leave a comment if you want a breakdown of an individual supplement that I mention but was not given a detailed description.\n\nThe primary focus of this mix is to speed up the clearance of acetaldehyde, to reinforce/protect/regenerate/enhance the antioxidant enzymes to lessen oxidative damage, and finally to get the brain's neurochemistry back into balance to lessen the chances of addictive behavior patterns and relieve the anxiety and fucked up mental state a hangover/withdrawal brings with it.\n\nI made this formula to protect against as much harm using the fewest number of ingredients possible. At the end of this list is a summary that includes other ingredients I researched, and categorically where they could also help. Feel free to ask for summaries on them. For instance, passion flower naturally increases Testosterone and is awesome for anti-addictive behaviors.\n\n**Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALC)** \\- Protects antioxidant enzymes, stabilizes neurotransmission, and protects mitochondria - the power house of the cell. May help you sleep too.\n\n* Increases activity of GTX and SOD (antioxidant enzymes). Strong neuroprotective effects\n* Stabilization of neurotransmission by ALC after long-term alcohol consumption may be associated with the protection of neuronal mitochondrial function\n* Prevents alcohol-induced mitochondrial damage, energy depletion due to defective respiratory chain complexes, oxidative-mediated neuroinflammation, and neuronal degeneration\n* Sustained the neuronal LFS and LTP synaptic transmission by preserving the integrity of neurofilaments and by maintaining dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons\n* Can also potentially restore/protect acetylate histones concentrations, which are necessary for sleep and damaged by ethanol/Acetaldehyde\n* Easily crosses Blood Brain Barrier (BBB)\n\n**Agmatine Sulfate (AS)** \\- Helps with glutamate toxicity, GABA/Glutamate balance.\n\n* Inhibits NOS - which produces NO in the brain, a RNS.\n* Attenuates glutamate induced neurotoxicity (major withdrawal symptom)\n* “Agmatine is an endogenous ligand for imidazoline receptors, Imidazoline receptors modulate several actions of ethanol, its intake and the development of dependence or withdrawal syndrome. Importantly, the effects of agmatine on ethanol withdrawal induced anxiety and behavioural sensitization were mediated by imidazoline receptors.” Agamatine activates these receptors\n* Normalized the elevated corticosterone levels and prevented the body weight changes in chronically stressed animals.\n* Crosses BBB easily.\n\n**Trimethylglycine - Betaine** \\- Liver protective, accelerated clearance of acetaldehyde.\n\n* Protects liver by restoring SAM:SAH balance, which allows certain enzymes to function properly\n* Significantly reduced the (Blood Alcohol Level) BAL compared to ethanol fed rats without betaine.\n* Possibly works by increasing metabolic rate to produce more NAD+ to clear ethanol/acetaldehyde\n\n**Curcumin** \\- Antioxidant, speeds up acetaldehyde clearance, brain protective.\n\n* Good antioxidant, neuroprotective, liver protective, stops lipid peroxidation. Dose-dependent effect.\n* Able to reverse the alcohol-induced inhibition of ADH activity and to suppress CYP2E1 activity and protein levels, which indicates that curcumin supplementation appears to promote alcohol oxidation via ADH\n* reversed the alcohol-induced inhibition of the ALDH activity - promotes alcohol oxidation via ADH and also increases ALDH activity\n* potently stimulates neurogenesis and therefore, it has been proposed as a therapeutic agent for treating neurodegenerative disorders and substance abuse\n\n**Dihydromyricetin (DHM)** \\- acetaldehyde clearance, GABA/Glutamate neurochemistry balance.\n\n* Antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial, antiinflammatory, anticancer\n* DHM improved lipid and alcohol metabolism, antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation on mice fed alcohol for 10 days, protecting against liver injury.\n* Lowers ethanol levels in serum by increasing ADH activity.\n* DHM greatly reduced EtOH consumption in an intermittent voluntary EtOH intake paradigm in rats\n* Regulates the effects alcohol has on the GABA system (reverses the effects) in consumption + withdrawal\n* Poor bioavailability, lipophilic, unstable in light and heat. Better to put in tandem with hovenia dulcis full spectrum flavinoid extract - then liposomal nano-encapsulation. One of the best GABA modulators available.\n\n**Milk Thistle - Silymarin** \\- oxidative stress protection, liver protection, antioxidant enzyme restoration.\n\n* One enhanced form of silymarin binds silybin to phosphatidylcholine. Research indicates that phosphatidylcholine-bound silybin is better absorbed and produces better clinical results than other forms. 3 to 4x bioavailability. (liposome)\n* Liver protective. Very potent antioxidant, increasing GSH activity and levels. Antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulation, fat control, neuroprotective, kidney protective.\n* Very low toxicity if any.\n* Silymarin prevents the depletion of glutathione (GSH) induced by alcohol and other liver toxins. Even in normal people, silymarin has been shown to raise the basal GSH level in the liver by 35%.\n\n**Boswellia** \\- Oxidative stress protective, reset metabolism.\n\n* Active compounds: Boswellic Acid + Terpene compounds - incensole (1) and incensole acetate (2) are effective in anti-inflammatory, with the latter in anti-depression.Work best in tandem vs alone.\n* Boosts SOD and GSx enzymes activity in the brain, powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory\n* Antidiabetic, boosts insulin sensitivity.\n\n**Glycine** \\- neurotransmitter regulation - specific GABA/Glutamate\n\n* N-methylglycine may be a version of glycine that will be bioactive and can cross the BBB. Though glycine may actually be orally available.\n* Glycine is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter like GABA.\n* rats experiencing withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption showed higher anxiety and sensitivity to stress compared to their alcohol-naïve counterparts. Intra-LHb injection of glycine attenuated these aberrant behaviors and reduced alcohol intake upon alcohol re-access.\n* administration of glycine to alcohol-supplemented rats markedly reduced the accumulation of cholesterol, phospholipids, free fatty acids and triglycerides in the circulation, liver and brain\n* Ethanol antagonizes central effects of glutamate by inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. The co-agonist glycine has been shown to reverse alcohol-mediated effects.\n* glutamate acts as the neurotransmitter and glycine as a modulator, both co-agonists are required for full receptor activation\n\n**L - Theanine** \\- Neurotransmitter regulation - specific GABA/Glutamate\n\n* Passes freely through BBB, reduces glutamate release, increases GABA, glycine, and dopamine.- neuroprotective\n* Anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, restoration of altered neurotransmitter levels, motor behavioral improvements.\n* The inhibitory concentration of L-theanine was found to be 80 to 30,000- fold less than that of L-glutamic acid. L-theanine is capable of binding to all the three glutamate receptors subtypes and cause favorable down-regulation of glutamate excitotoxicity\n* Has been recommended as a sleep aid because of its anti-anxiety effects.\n* L-theanine administration at daily doses of 200–400 mg appears to confer anxiolytic and stress-reducing effects. Acute effects of L-theanine are observed few hours after its intake, and its chronic effects also appear to be positive\n\n**N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC)** \\- Reducing oxidative damage and regulating/protecting proper neurochemistry.\n\n* Alcohol-induced oxidative stress was inhibited by NAC supplementation in multiple studies.\n* Antioxidant, antiinflammatory. Prevents withdrawal stress. Anti-addictive\n* As a glutamate-modulating agent, NAC can quickly stabilize a hyperactive glutamate system in a critical timing for withdrawal and relapse\n* Oral supplementation appears to be of low bioavailability (< 10%) such that oral administration of 600–1200 mg NAC per day resulted in only 16 and 35 μM plasma NAC, respectively. There were complications when NAC was administreted intraveneously.\n* N-acetylcysteine, an amino acid derivative, helps to restore the levels of phospholipids to near normal during ethanol-induced toxicity\n* Ameliorates negative neuroadaptive changes produced by alcohol, as well as alcohol induced behavioral sensitization, anxiety-like behavior and alcohol withdrawal signs in preclinical models\n* Alcohol withdrawal increases leptin, NAC reversed this\n* Previous work demonstrating the neuroprotective effects of NAC on oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain underlie the hypothesis of the current study. NAC is an indirect precursor for GSH by elevating the levels of cysteine which leads to GSH synthesis. It is well demonstrated that NAC is a GSH enhancing agent (from GCG study)\n* **\\*\\*\\*One study found that NAC given after alcohol intoxication worsens effects. I mention this earlier about when to take this formulation.**\n\n**Taurine - N-Acetyl-Taurine (NAT)** \\- clearing acetate and speeding up clearance of acetaldehyde.\n\n* Taurine is involved in alcohol metabolism to form NAT. An increase in taurine could increase EtOH metabolism\n* Ethanol -> acetate. Taurine clears acetate. Too much acetate is hyperacetatemia.\n* Hyperacetatemia has been associated with the development of dyslipoproteinemia and atherosclerosis, especially in some hemodialysis patients (66), and has also been recently implicated as a main cause of alcohol hangover headache\n* Taurine’s level can partially reflect the status of sulfur-containing amino acids in vivo. The protective effects of taurine against the ethanol-induced toxicities, such as hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation, have been revealed in several studies on taurine supplementation\n* Acetate increases adenosine in many tissues, including the brain - \\[49,50\\]. The adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, administered after ethanol, blocked the nociceptive behaviors associated with ethanol. This suggests that adenosine contributes to ethanol induced hypersensitivity. Taurine clears acetate, so less adenosine.\n\n**Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)** \\- Nicotinamide Riboside and Ubiquinone are very similar - speeding up metabolism of acetaldehyde and regenerating antioxidant enzymes.\n\n* Treatment with NMN prominently rescued the ethanol-induced reduction in the NAD+/NADH ratio\n* Ubiquinone speeds up the metabolism of alcohol and acetaldehyde by increasing NAD+ availability.\n* NR, NMN, and Ubiquinol are all NAD+ precursors\n* NR has been identified as an NAD+ precursor, existing in foods, without side effects of flushing \\[17\\]. Boosting NAD+ concentrations and NAD+ dependent enzymes can be therapeutic in certain metabolic disorders, such as obesity, NAFLD and T2D, even hepatocellular carcinoma\n* NMN also increased NAD+ levels, which could be a useful intervention related to metabolic disorders, but it isn’t found in dietary constituents\n\n**Tyrosine** \\- restoring neurotransmitters\n\n* Tyrosine is the main precursor to catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine)\n* Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for dopamine synthesis, whereas monoamine oxidase is the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of dopamine into DOPAC\n* A recent study found that alcohol increases the activity of TH without altering the activity of monoamine oxidase\n\n# Notes on Supplements:\n\nPlant extracts tend to have a major problem. Bioavailability. For example, milk thistle is less than 1% bioavailable. Recently, advances have been made to increase bioavailability with encapsulation methods - most notably the phytosome and liposomal encapsulation techniques - or including other ingredients that increase bioavailability - like black pepper (bioperine) for curcumin.\n\nIn my ingredients, I mention betacyclodextrin and phytosomes. These are two encapsulation methods that increase bioavailability about 5 to 10x. They also make the extracts more dissolvable in water. Indena is THE major seller of phytosomal complexes - they got patents - and they sell to multiple retailers. If you type phytosome curcumin in Amazon, you'll find them. Another source is [botany.bio](https://botany.bio/)\n\nI have not been able to find a reliable source for betacyclodextrin DHM complex. Pure DHM works fine, just not as bioavailable and not water soluble.\n\nEverything else mentioned can be found on Amazon in bulk powder with great quality and on the cheap.\n\n**Summary of Effects and Other Supplements Researched :**\n\nROS and RNS damage - inflammation, neuroinflammation, lipid peroxidation.\n\n* Agmatine Sulfate, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Betaine, Boswellia, Beta-caryophyllene, Curcumin, Dihydromyricetin, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Gingko Biloba, Ginseng + Sea Buckthorn, Glycine, Honokiol + Magnolol + Ginger, L - citrulline, L - Theanine, Milk Thistle, N-Acetyl-Cysteine, Oleoylethanolamide, Resveratrol, Spirulina, GCG\n\nAntioxidant enzyme, cofactor, and substrate depletion.\n\n* Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Ashwaganda, Curcumin, Magnesium, Manganese, Zinc, Milk Thistle, N-Acetyl-Cysteine, N-Acetyl-Taurine, GCG\n\nMitochondrial damage + dysfunction\n\n* Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Nicotinamide Riboside\n\nEndocrine system hormonal systems out of whack\n\n* Agmatine Sulfate, Ginseng + Sea Buckthorn, Passion Flower\n\nNeurotransmitter dysfunction (GABA, Glutamate, Dopamine, Serotonin, Acetylcholine)\n\n* Agmatine Sulfate, Ashwaganda, Curcumin, Dihydromyricetin, Honokiol + Magnolol + Ginger, Levo - tetrahydropalmatine, L - Theanine, Melatonin, N-Acetyl-Cysteine, Oleoylethanolamide, Passion Flower, Resveratrol, Tyrosine\n\nDecrease in insulin sensitivity (like diabetes) - metabolism\n\n* Betaine, Boswellia, Gingko Biloba, Glycine, Milk Thistle, N-Acetyl-Taurine, Nicotinamide Riboside, Oleoylethanolamide, Resveratrol, Spirulina, GCG\n\nSleep Cycle disruption - histone acetylation disruption, circadian rhythm.\n\n* Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Honokiol + Magnolol + Ginger, L - Theanine, Melatonin, Passion Flower\n\nMicrobiome damage\n\n* Probiotics\n\n**About Me and Whatever:**\n\nDuring this awesome pandemic, I found myself unemployed after selling a previous company. It was at this time that my father started just randomly blacking out when he got up too quickly. To make a long story short, he went to a doc - and doc told him you need to stop drinking. Soon after my mom caught him sneaking swigs in the garage. He finally admitted he'd been an alcoholic for 30 years, basically sneaking off to drink without anybody knowing. Great.\n\nWith time on my hands and a bit of anger, I decided to dive in. I didn't want other people to end up like my dad. From my research, I quickly found that hangovers are a form of withdrawal. The primary cause of alcoholism is from the GABA/Glutamate imbalance during withdrawal that makes it oh so easy to drink more and more.\n\nI blasted through about 400 or so research papers to dig into natural supplements available to remedy as many of the effects of alcohol I could find. I presented my findings to my dad, and he was pretty blown away. Not because it was a magical cure, but because the main thesis was something he had already heard. As it turns out, about a week before I shared all my research and the initial formulation of 40 something supplements, he had found a new age clinic that had repurposed GABA regulating pharmaceuticals to combat alcoholism - with astonishing success.\n\nMy dad had been running through various programs over these past months with very little to show for it. This pharma treatment that specifically targeted the GABA/Glutamate balance has been working for him. As of today, he's been sober for about 3.5 months.\n\nAlcoholism is a sliding scale. It's not a binary - alcoholic, non-alcoholic thing. And it is specific to each person. It just seems to me, at least from my experience seeing other friends fall off a cliff in this shit, is that it starts slow and can accelerate at such a slow pace that it doesn't even seem like anything has changed. Then you hit an inflection point, maybe caused by something as mundane as losing a girlfriend or job (or being isolated for 6 months in quarantine) and that process speeds up to where you lose control.\n\nSo when I've been asked, \"won't stopping a hangover make people just drink more.\" This is a major part of my answer. I also believe that we should take all measures to protect our health - body and mind - if we decide to take substances that we know are harmful. Everyone knows alcohol is essentially poison, so why not make it better?\n\nOf course, this formulation is not for alcoholics. If you have a serious problem, go get help.\n\nCheers.\n\n[u/stck123](https://www.reddit.com/u/stck123/)\n\n[u/DDRFlashGordon](https://www.reddit.com/u/DDRFlashGordon/)\n\n[u/relaxed\\_1](https://www.reddit.com/u/relaxed_1/)\n\n[u/BraveSirrrRobin](https://www.reddit.com/u/BraveSirrrRobin/)\n\n[u/pompino](https://www.reddit.com/u/pompino/)\n\n[u/sillykumquat-](https://www.reddit.com/u/sillykumquat-/)\n\n[u/nejonehas](https://www.reddit.com/u/nejonehas/)\n\n[u/ShivasLimb](https://www.reddit.com/u/ShivasLimb/)\n\nu/Dal567",

Not just the usual stuff — they looked at **multi-omics data**: proteins, genes, metabolites. The whole picture.\n\nWhat stood out to me?\n\nWith consistent exercise, the body doesn’t just get fitter — it actually starts **aging more slowly**.\n\n* Less inflammation\n* Fewer senescent (aging) cells\n* A boost in something called **betaine metabolism**\n\nThat last one surprised me.\n\nTurns out, betaine (a molecule we partly make in our kidneys when we move regularly) plays a big role in protecting cells from age-related decline. In mice, boosting it even reversed signs of aging.\n\nAnd here’s the wild part:  \nBetaine seems to bind to and inhibit a protein linked to aging (TBK1). That’s not just a fitness benefit — that’s a potential **longevity mechanism**.\n\nIt makes me think:  \nMaybe we’ve been underestimating just how powerful regular movement is. Not just for healthspan — but *lifespan*.\n\nLink:\n\n[https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00635-X?\\_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS009286742500635X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue](https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00635-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS009286742500635X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)",

It has a hydrophobic tail (water-hating) and a hydrophilic head (water-loving). The hydrophobic tail binds to the oil in your hair (since oil is also hydrophobic) and when you wash it off with water, its hydrophilic head binds to the water, removing the oil/grease it’s bound to in the process. \n\nCocamidopropyl betaine is an amphoteric surfactant. SLS/sulfates, the most commonly used surfactants, are anionic surfactants. Anionic surfactants are harsher and can be irritating that’s why gentler surfactants are preferred by those who have sensitive skin. That’s why you’ll see SLS/sulfate-free shampoos or facial cleansers being sold in the market. They are usually marketed as “gentle” cleansers.",

I have ALWAYS been antimlm, especially since I went to college in the Verve by Vemma era. \n\nThe company I have the MOST issue with is 100% Monat. This reason being is because I am a LICENSED stylist of 10 years. I am currently in a different field of work but working as a stylist for 10 years helped me get through college. \n\nCome to find out a friend of ours (mostly of my boyfriend) has a new girlfriend. Cool , I love another girl in the group. I do some minimal Instagram sleuthing and come to find out she’s a HUGE MONAT HUN. & I mean HUGE. Wearing the clothes, doing cringey tik tocs, doing “transformation videos”, getting together with other huns to push their scummy tactics. It’s all around gross. My boyfriend thinks I get too worked up about it but in all honesty, I went to cosmetology school for 2 years, completed 1700 hours of school, took two state boards, & over the past 10 years have advanced my training with classes, conventions, learning, literally THOUSANDS of dollars, for what? For some impressionable, scatterbrained dimwit to “educate” women on hair care? Someone who has NO background, no license, to push products on unsuspecting, naïve people? On cancer patients? On people who have conditions that cause hair loss? A company that has SO many lawsuits. \n\nNot to mention the preying on desperate people during a world wide pandemic who lost their jobs. \n\nIt truly makes me angry, as a stylist, as someone who actually worked to be able to educate people on hair care, as someone whose partner owns their ACTUAL own business. \n\nIt really boils my blood.\n\nEdit: For the multiple huns who PM'd me saying I have no idea what I am talking about.\n\nMonat claims to be vegan, natural & organic, but in fact they are NOT. Moant products have been shown to contain Capixyl & Cocamidopropyl Betaine. Cocamidopropyl Betaine is an extreme allergen for people who have sensitive scalp/skin, people with skin disorders, and people with compromised immune systems like CANCER or going through CHEMO. The products also contain red clover extract, which is known to interact with certain medications like birth control, tamoxifen, , & medications that thin your blood. It also has estrogenic properties so its recommend that people who are breast feeding or pregnant/trying to get pregnant should avoid it. \n\nNOW if you took medicine for say MS or where going through chemo, do you think Becky from high-school knows that the products she's pushing with no proper professional training will interact with those medications? or should not be given to people who have allergies or sensitive skin?  THIS is why I took two state tests after 1700 hours of schooling, & why I can give PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.",

You have to deal with high and unrealistic expectations constantly (brunette wants to be platinum blonde in one session) and people get mad because you can’t change laws of chemistry!\n\nThe very existence of Monat is an insult. They lack accountability and the sellers don’t have a clue what they’re doing. They’re just money hungry with no expertise and it’s an insult to stylists and the public. Plus, how can they keep churning out all these product lines? I don’t expect much care went into it.  Is this some private label thing? Do they even employ chemists? And why are people getting chemical burns and losing hair from these products?? What kind of idiot thinks selling shampoo that they have no input in formulating or pricing will allow them to park themselves on a yacht in the Caribbean til their end of days?\n\nDon’t get me started on the clothes and bad dancing 🤦‍♀️\n\nVery sorry to hear this and I get it.

Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "After starting [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/510zfo/should_we_be_using_low_ph_shampoo/) yesterday, I decided to put together a list featuring ABers' suggestions (from that post) and the results of my own research. Perhaps in due time we can have another spreadsheet as ppl begin pH testing their own products... but here's what I have for  now! (and ofc I'm happy to update this list w/ any comments that come into this post << I have not done this yet for this post, will update at end of day or so!!)      \n\nI'm lumping shampoos & body washes together b/c IMO surfactants are surfactants are surfactants so any body wash can be used on the hair and vice versa (and face, honestly, if the ingreds are gentle enough - but as it so happens, few of these are)   \n\n- don't laugh yall, but one of the lowest pH & lowest cost options out here is ~intimates~ body wash. our lady gardens have a low pH and so do the washes designed for that area.    \nSummer's Eve is quite inexpensive, you can get 45oz (15oz x3) for only $13 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=summer%27s+eve)! simple ingredients too: *Purified Water, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ammonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Fd&C Blue No. 1*. those who are prone to SD are advised to avoid SLES & SLS, but some can tolerate ALES, so I might try this for shampoo - why not?! my husband might be a little confused but whatevs #killinthegame     \n[and as for exactly what pH it is, website says: *Summer’s Eve’s pH-balanced products are formulated to be in harmony with the areas on which they are used. For topical application to the skin, they are formulated for a slightly acidic pH (about 5-6). For application to the vagina, they are formulated for mildly acidic pH (a pH of about 3.0-3.5).* I'm not certain which category washes fall under lol]\n\n- [Aqua Glycolic](http://www.aquaglycolic.com/product-aqua-glycolic-shampoo-body-cleanser) makes a pH 4.5 shampoo/body wash with 14% glycolic acid, retails ~$16/8 oz      \n\n- [Neutrogena T-Sal](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/t-sal-+therapeutic+shampoo+-+scalp+build-up+control.do?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PLA+-+Hair+-+SKU&utm_term=&utm_content=|mkwid|sQN6gfQPl_dc|pcrid|121181768720) has long been my go-to during SD flareups, a bit pricy to use regularly though (~$7/4.5 oz). it's 3% salicylic acid and I remember reading somewhere the pH is ~4.5     \n\n- everything from [Sebamed](https://www.sebamedusa.com/facial-cleanser#?offset=0&limit=24) is listed as pH 5.5, with the exception of a feminine care wash that's listed as 3.8 (I've seen it on some etailers but not on their official website, possibly DC'ed?) & a post-menopausal feminine care wash listed as 6.0; their shampoos and body washes aren't cheap tho. Cerave foaming is cheaper per oz <-- not sure how it would fare as a shampoo, but I bet Cerave would be a perfectly fine option for body wash!   \n\n- u/ms_moonlight recommends shampoos from \"*Keracare. It's marketed towards black women, but anyone can use it.*\" this makes sense, as relaxers are often super basic, so acidic shampoos are very important. after researching this brand a bit, I can confirm that all of their shampoos & conditioners list their pH on the front! I've seen anything from [4.5](https://www.amazon.com/AVLON-Keracare-Lather-Shampoo-Ounce/dp/B0054Y1KO2/ref=sr_1_10_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1473012244&sr=8-10&keywords=keracare+shampoo)-6 (and even lower for their conditioners). sells for about $10/8 oz (but you can find cheaper) to under $20/1L, easily available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=keracare+shampoo)!\n\n- Many salon/higher end brands are labeled with pH 4.5-5.5; of these, Joico can often be obtained relatively inexpensively at $20-30 for 1L, but u/oliviart123 cautions: *NEVER buy (american) professional salon brands anywhere OTHER than a licenced salon. It is illegal for someone to sell them on amazon/ebay and at drugstores like target/walgreens/walmart, even costco. Theres a huge black market for counterfeit salon products which is why you \"see\" them everywhere. No salon brand actually sells on amazon and most of the bottles will say its only gaurenteed to be legit IF purchased from a licensed salon.*   \nrelated, I know [Sally Beauty](http://www.sallybeauty.com/shampoo/Hair01,default,sc.html#~EDGE~!sort.axis__default~~!page.size__48~~page.number__1~~!curated.hair_solutions__Color%20Protect!~EDGE~) tends to have a lot of pro-quality stuff at pleb prices, so I'd be interested to see if any of their shampoos list pH's   \nalso, I believe Nexxus Therappe is also in the correct range\n\n- u/julietpae suggests [Malibu C](https://www.malibuc.com/catalog/cn/60/shampoos) shampoos *Malibu products are designed from a Vitamin C/ascorbic acid complex that is proven to stop and prevent oxidizers from effecting your hair. Most of all their products are vegan/gluten/sulfate/paraben and fragrance free* I haven't been able to confirm their pH anywhere, but maybe it's listed on the bottle?    \n\n- lastly, not surfactants, but u/im_twelve_ and u/thee_zohan both recommend the Herbal Essences cleansing conditioners. u/okayzac adds: it's good to use something purifying still once in awhile. Things like cleansing conditioners that do not provide any surfactant cleanse can potentially lead to hair loss (i.e Wen is being sued over this) we can build up the hormone DHT which when we reach too high of levels can lead to hair loss.   \n\n    FYI: any \"no more tears\" baby shampoo probably has pH ~7\n\n\n**Asian/international products**   \n\n- Lador acid shampoo: pH 4.5, $8/150ml from [Memebox](https://us.memebox.com/damage-protector-acid-shampoo?pdref=category)   \n\n- u/noys has pH tested Ryoe damage care shampoo as 5.5, kracie moisturizing shampoo 5.5-6. u/okayzac lists the Ryoe anti-aging shampoo as HG (not pH tested, but hopefully similar!)  \n\n- u/marybanana says the Ka'fen acid shampoo series (marketed towards color protection) from Taiwan lists *shampoo is 5.4, and the conditioner is 4.0. It's been two weeks, and my scalp has shown distinct improvement* but hasn't found a good ordering source yet  \n\n- u/xomandark *Whamisa has a line of shampoo (one for oily scalp, one for dry scalp) and they are both pH 4.5. I used the dry version for quite some time and it was pretty soothing to my easily irritated scalp. They also have a scalp tonic which is THE BEST at calming irritation* ordered from testerkorea   \n\n- breathlessly waiting for the exact brand name from u/neko-miko *Since I started Keratin treatments, I had to stop using shampoo with sulphates and sodium chloride.\nAfter searching for a while (and using the Sebamed shampoo which was fine and also cheaper in Germany), I now use a super cheap low-ph shampoo / shower gel combo made for kids which fulfills all my requirements and costs less than 1€.\nI haven't had any scalp problems since.*   \n\n- Eucerin makes a [pH 5 shampoo](http://int.eucerin.com/products/dermocapillaire/ph5-mild-shampoo) but it doesn't seem very easy to order (or at least, I'm not nearly as savvy with sources for ordering from Europe as from Asia haha)    \n\n\nIf you google around, pplz on the Internet have also done some pH testing, e.g. [here](http://www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com/2012/02/ph-of-shampoo-ultimate-list.html), [here](http://forums.longhaircommunity.com/showthread.php?t=90642), [here](http://acovant.com/shampoo.html)",

I've been washing my face with a \"feminine hygiene gel\" for 3 weeks now (for Europeans: **Facelle intim Waschlotion Sensitive**, available in Rossmann) and it's been great. I wasn't expecting fireworks, it's just a cleanser, but it does the job very well, no tightness, no irritation. And it just couldn't get any cheaper! I've been meaning to start using it all over my body, but I have this deliciously smelling shower gel that I can't give up just yet :)\nThe pH is 4,5, it almost doesn't foam at all with hands, but foams nicely with a konjac sponge.  \n  \nIngredients:\n*Aqua, Lauryl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sorbitol, Urea, Propylene Glycol, Allantoin, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Parfum, Serine, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima Fruit Extract, Ethoxydiglycol, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid*\n \n\nSorry this isn't AB, but I felt the need to share this fantastic discovery. Maybe somebody who has access to Rossmann would use this information. Having said that, I'd recommend checking ingredients. \"Feminine hygiene gels\" usually have lower pH than shower gels (though not always!), but many of them contain harsh surfactants and other ingredients that could dry or irritate the skin.  \n  \nEdit: missing word",

This took me a few days to start writing and ruminate on, so I’m really glad it seemed worth it for a lot of people. I’ll try to keep this going in for future major Ipsy skincare items! I’m about to get really busy in a month but I’ll do what I can! ❤️\n\nHey all,\n\nI've been seeing a lot of  posts about the Cryo ATP Sports Booster serum and how people don't know what it is exactly supposed to do... it doesn't help that the official 111Skin's description for it is just filled with nonsensical marketing bullsh\\*t. Considering the huge price tag, I think we're all feeling a lot more curious about it than most serums that wind up in our bags. As I'm reluctantly receiving this in my bag (Ipsy chose it for me), I'm putting in some time to figure it out.\n\n**Objective & Disclaimer:** Let's put aside the pseudoscience jargon used in 111Skin's description and try to figure out what the serum itself should do for your skin. I'm not an expert *in any way* but I'm a skincare enthusiast... I thought maybe it might be worth posting an interpretation of what this serum is formulated to do, since it appears the company itself fails to say anything useful at all on their website. At the very end of this, I'll explain how I think this product got its name. Again, I'm not an expert so if anyone knows better or has their own input feel free to chime in!\n\n**Product description per** [**official webpage**](https://111skin.com/products/cryo-atp-sports-booster): \"Mimicking the effect of extreme cold on the skin, this booster contains natural cellular energy, ATP, to encourage more oxygen for optimised cell function. Just a few drops of this highly-charged formula will reignite lacklustre skin, leaving it tightened, toned, and refined for a reinvigorated complexion. Perfect for use post-workout, this booster will prolong freshness for enlivened and refreshed skin.\"\n\n**Ingredients list**:  Aqua / Water / Eau, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester, Ribose, Acrylates Copolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Carbomer, Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Tromethamine, Adenosine, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Adenosine Triphosphate, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Fragrance / Parfum.\n\nOK, now let's break it down \\[key ingredients in **bold**\\].\n\n* **#1 Water**\n* **#2 Glycerin--** this is a humectant, meaning it attracts water into the skin and helps with hydration. The fact that this is #2 tells you that this should be a moisturizing serum.\n* **#3 Niacinamide--** I'm pleased to see that this is #3 in the ingredients list-- and I believe this should make the biggest difference in the serum for most people that aren't already using niacinamide. It's essentially a niacinamide serum with a lot of other bells and whistles. Niacinamide  (aka vitamin B3) is a really common ingredient that is non-irritating to most people but can cause some stinging sensation for some. It evens out skintone, reduces appearance of pores, evens out skin texture (ie, reduces congestion), and boosts ability for moisturizers to work (and thus is wonderfully paired with glycerin).  Most people that aren't already using a serum or some kind of special moisturizer might not have niacinamide in their routine, which is why I think this'd be the most \"groundbreaking\" ingredient for those that aren't already using it. It's the key ingredient that is the reason people rave about the Peach and Lily's Glass Serum which is essentially a niacinamide and hyaluronic acid serum. But here's the catch-- all these benefits won't happen overnight. It needs to be used consistently over a period of at least a week, but likely much longer than that, to start showing effects. Here's a great [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qd7J1UNGUo&t=909s) by Dr. Dray, a real dermatologist, that explains benefits of niacinamide.\n* \\#4 Butylene glycol-- a solvent so ingredients that don't dissolve well in water can be more evenly spread out in the serum\n* \\#5 1,2-Hexanediol-- a preservative\n* \\#6 Betaine-- a humectant\n* \\#7 Polyglycerol-10 Laurate-- skin softener\n* \\#8 Phenoxyethanol-- a preservative\n* \\#9 Caprylyl Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#10 Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester-- I actually don't know what this is and can't find an immediate Google answer\n* **#11 Ribose-**\\- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It apparently [might play a role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047922/) in helping boost collagen production. \\[[Another source](https://www.oskiaskincare.com/skin-nutrition/patented-actives/ribose/#:~:text=Riboxyl%20or%20Ribose%20is%20a,naturally%20in%20all%20living%20cells.&text=It%20is%20the%20only%20known,new%20energy%20to%20tired%20skin) that explains the mechanism a little bit.\\]\n* \\#12 Acrylates Copolymer-- a microplastic for enhancing texture of product\n* \\#13 Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer-- thicken product, enhances texture of product\n* \\#14 Carbomer-- thicken product\n* \\#15 Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol-- skin tightener\n* \\#16 Pentylene Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#17 Tromethamine-- a pH adjuster\n* **#18 Adenosine**\\-- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It [might play a role](https://koreanskincaretips.com/adenosine-in-skincare/)in helping boost collagen production (and thus can may have anti-wrinkle properties).\n* **#19 Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil**\\-- offers a cooling sensation upon application, and I suspect is the reason 111Skin relates this product to cryotherapy... even though it has nothing to do with it. It might feel nice on the skin at first for people that aren't immediately irritated, but it can be an irritating ingredient to those with sensitive skin. This might be why some people are saying that they're seeing some redness after application. In the long term it's a sensitizing ingredient. Don't continue its use if you find your skin is irritated upon application. Edit: I should’ve researched this more, but it seems eucalyptus oil also has antiseptic, anti inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which are all good things. However, it’s also not recommended by a lot of dermatologists due to how easily it can irritate skin for some people. (This is the case for many essential oils.)\n* \\#20 Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer\n* **#21 Adenosine triphosphate**\\-- ATP itself and gives the serum its name. This [L'oreal webpage](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/ingredient-library/atp.aspx) succinctly describes what its supposed to do in skincare.\n* \\#22 Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract-- skin soothing properties\n* \\#23 Xanthan gum-- for product texture\n* \\#24 Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil-- an emollient\n* \\#25 Fragrance/parfum-- the yummy smells and potential irritant\n\n**Interpretation**: There's a fair amount of humectants in this serum, with glycerin being #2 right after water. That can be promising for people with dry skin. Right after glycerin is niacinamide, which if you don't know is a holy grail ingredient for a lot of products. Anyone that doesn't already have this in their routine but has textured skin, irritation, uneven skintone, or enlarged pores, may benefit the most from this serum. Note that the positive effects of niacinamide will take weeks to show, so don't expect this to work overnight! Unfortunately niacinamide can cause some stinging sensation for some people which can be off putting. The \"*cryo*\" part in the product name is thanks to the eucalyptus oil, which gives a cooling effect on the skin upon application. Really, it doesn't serve any substantial service. Maybe some people will find it temporarily soothing but those with sensitive skin, it is a major irritant and a sensitizer. Lastly, the \"*ATP*\" portion of the name-- there's ribose, adenosine, and adenosine triphosphate in the serum. These ingredients are supposed to interact together to promote rejuventation, whatever the hell that means. From the webpages I've linked, it seems these three ingredients should promote collagen production within the skin, which should help battle wrinkling and dullness of the skin.  I haven't delved too deep into the studies that show its efficacy but if someone else wants to do that, please share with us what you find! As for why this product has \"*sports*\" in the name? ...Uh, because the eucalyptus oil might feel good on hot skin post-workout, and something about adding ATP onto one's skin will supposedly help restore ATP that is supposedly used up during the workout?\n\nAnyway, overall I'm optimistic about this serum for people with non-sensitive skin. The eucalyptus oil and fragrance/parfum added might be too much for some of us to handle, but for those that can handle it and that don't have a robust skincare routine yet, I'm optimistic that the niacinamide can make a difference for a lot of people. Do I think it's worth the price tag because of that though? Nope. There's a lot of affordable niacinamide serums out there-- off the top of my head, The Ordinary's niacinamide + zinc serum \\[<$10\\] and Peach and Lily's glass skin serum \\[<$40\\] are the holy grails for so many people. (The glass skin serum is my own HG for fixing my textured skin.) As for the ATP components of this serum... without looking more into efficacy studies I'm not sure if it'll do anything on that front. If anything, the niacinamide should visibly address the things that the ATP ingredients should supposedly  be taking care of. As long as it isn't harmful, then, ah well why not, I guess.\n\nThat said, I just wanted to remind anyone new to skincare that it takes weeks to show major results... but if you are having a bad reaction to it, stop using it! Irritation on the skin can spur so many issues, it isn't worth it.\n\ntl;dr-- I think this is just a fancy niacinamide serum and 111Skin tried to set themselves apart from other products by adding words like \"cryo\" and \"ATP\"... and tried to make it niche by adding \"sports\". Aside from marketing BS, it might not be a horrible serum and would be worth trying for anyone that doesn't have a niacinamide product yet (assuming niacinamide, eucalyptus oil, and/or  fragrance doesn't irritate their skin too much).",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70.

Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz.

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\". These have different names because they're pseudoceramides and/or a part of a patented biomimetic system/delivery method.\n\nSkin Identical Ingredients/ceramides/helpfuls highlighted in **BOLD** except for hyaluronic acid because I can't tell if high molecular weight or low molecular weight HAs were used (some find LMW HA irritating).\n\n*Fragrance = essential oils & artificial fragrance, left in fragrant extracts (less concentrated than essential oils)*\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Curél Intensive Moisture Facial Cream**](https://www.ulta.com/intensive-moisture-facial-cream?productId=pimprod2009883) **- 1.4 oz/40 g -

    "body": " I just want to share the steps that cured me of a chronic case of yeast and other gut infections like SIBO confirmed by lab tests but never treated by doctors because antibiotics and antifungals only worked for some weeks before it would return. I hope it will help someone who finds themselves in a position similar to mine! **I have to mention that i am not a doctor and this is an anecdotal success-story.**\n\n*My main issues before this protocol:*\n\n* *IBS, SIBO (diagnosed by my doctor)*\n* *Chronic candida infection*\n* *Acne*\n* *Bad sleep patterns*\n\n# Ingredients for my protocol:\n\n* In-depth informative podcast about SIBO, IBS,      Candida, and the digestive system and its connection to your brain: **IBS Freedom Podcast**\\*\n* A book about how to manage blood sugar levels and digestive health in correlation with your hormones: **Fix Your Period**\\* - Nicole Jardim\n* A detailed step-by-step book about candida, although you don't necessarily need to buy and read the entire book if you      find what you need from the author's free content + the above mentioned      podcast: **The Candida Crusher by Eric Bakker**\\*\n* A \"**leaky gut diet plan\\***\" that  helped me figure out my gut issues hands-on (lifesaver!)\n* **An understanding of the gut-brain axis\\***\n\n# Supplements:\n\nProbiotics (taken on empty stomach, preferably morning + night):\n\n* **Reuteri, Rhamnous,** **S. Boulardii**\\*, **spore-based probiotics      (SIBO-friendly)**\n\nBiofilm breakers and immune boosters (also best taken in between meals on empty stomach, but maybe not at the exact same time as the probiotics):\n\n* **Propolis, lactoferrin**\n\n**I did regular blood-tests to check my vitamin levels and treated them accordingly. For me, because i suffered from low stomach acid for example, i kept a close eye on B-vitamins and Zinc in particular.**\n\n# For SIBO/IBS specifically\n\n* **Hydrolized Guar Gum** (30 mins after lunch/dinner)\n* **Glutamine** (on empty stomach)\n* **Made and ate my own yogurt**\\***, with Reuteri and Rhamnous bacteria**\n\nI kickstarted my gut-healing by **only consuming homemade bone broth with olive oil for 3 days** to relax the stomach before eating a short-term diet of low-fodmap, low-oxalate, gluten-free, low-sugar food (fruits are generally ok, even if some people think this is not good on a candida diet for example, it's up to each person to check which foods they react to and make their own ideal diet based on this), and most important of all: different kinds of complex carbs and resistant starches. Reintroducing foods is important so i think my diet was restrictive for maximum 3 months and it would've been maybe 2 months if i had known where to start and where to stop on beforehand. One month was mostly figuring different foods out!\n\nNotice how i didn't go low-carb - this is because i tried this and it failed for me personally. It made my symptoms worse; infection got worse and i got anxiety through the roof. Research carbs and no-carbs in relation to the female body before considering for example keto as it is not for everyone!\n\n**My personal top 5 foods that i tolerated ok even when sick (and works as prebiotics!):**\n\n* Sweet potato\n* Quinoa\n* Carrots\n* Meats, but not pork because this personally      triggers histamine in me\n* Kiwi\n\nFor my indigestion and heartburn (mostly not needed anymore after i got better!):\n\n* **Betaine + pepsine** before every meal (diluted apple cider vinegar)\n* **Enzymes** with meals\n\n# Explanation behind my protocol:\n\n*PH values, blood sugar, cortisol levels and microflora are all important to our bodies.*\n\n**PH:** If your stomach is too basic, it's easy for things to go wrong with the rest of your body. Too high PH values result in non-beneficial bacteria and fungi (candida) to live inside your digestive system and pretty much everywhere else if it gets enough time. Avoid acid blockers as if your life depends on it for this reason! Many docs prescribe acid-blockers to people who experience heartburn even though for example my case of heartburn was **because of lacking stomach acid**\\* rather than having too much of it. SIBO sufferers are often a victim to this misunderstanding/scam.\n\n**Blood sugar:** Blood sugar and hormones are closely linked. Most people don't know this and for women, at some times in the cycle, for example close to menstruation, the hormonal changes and the instability it causes the blood sugar causes candida to thrive more - at a time where we crave sugary and carby foods the most! This is manageable for myself (and others according to research on diabetic people) by consuming the right carbs, proteins and starches for your body. I use **berberine**\\* to lower my blood sugar and it works for me personally BUT this should only be consumed if you're sure that your blood sugar is too high already, or else you will suffer low blood sugar. I also read once that it can trigger sulfur dominant SIBO so make sure to check out which kind of SIBO you have before considering it. Herbs are usually very potent and should be treated with caution just like vitamins, antibiotics or medication. Eating the wrong vegetable at the wrong day might cause you stomach cramps but eating the wrong spice might shock you more than that!\n\n**Cortisol levels:** When blood sugar is low, cortisol is produced to produce glucose. Cortisol is also produced when we are stressed, whether it be because we're happily working (out) or suffering physically, mentally or spiritually. Sleep, hydration, relaxation, therapy and good management of everyday life is important for stress-levels and for example the liver, something i didn't know until reading more about this in detail because i feared that some of my organs weren't doing their part. **The info on stress-liver relation\\*** is so scary to me that i actually went on a activity-pause where i did as little as humanly possible as to try to decrease all stress in my body and it did wonders for my digestion. I do **acupressure at home**\\* which, along with regular and NOT OVERDONE exercise makes me sleep like a baby.\n\n**Microflora:** **Our immune system, digestive system, vaginal system and mental state of mind all rely on our microflora**\\*\n\nI didn't think my acne and sleep issues were related to my vaginal infection but it turns at that for me, healing my gut fixed not only the infection but also said acne and sleep issues. A big bonus for me!\n\n**NB:** doctors may not know everything and even if they claim they cannot help you, use them as much as possible alongside with your knowledge. The books i suggest in this post helped me understand what kind of tests i could and should ask my doctor for, and going back and forth between the books and the doctor to get lab tests done and see the science for myself helped me figure out what and where my problems were.\n\nI believe SIBO is not an isolated issue and needs to be tackled by understanding the entire digestive system. The main solution for me was to support stomach acid, soemthing i would never think of doing if i were to only listen to my doctor's suggestions. Best of luck to everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**All links\\* are found in the comments**",

I am working with a naturopathic doctor who finally put me on a protocol with Candibactin AR/BR and probiotics.  I've had SIBO sx bc I took a ton of antibiotics to cure my vaginal condition at the time which then turned into sibo. Currently, I'm so stuck between the candida diet and low fodmap diet as I'm trying to kill the overgrowth of both. Do you have any suggestions on how to navigate eating? I switched to low fodmap (so hard) but then some of the fodmap OK foods are a NO in candida. Also, I thought sweet potato is not good bc its a carb if you have candida. Please clarify (: CAN'T WAIT TO HEAL. \n\nAlso, is there a brand of probiotics you used? My doctor switched me to 100B Ayush herbs (mixed lacto/bifido) species. I was doing some reading and some doctors don't recommend adding more \"fuel to the fire\" with lacto/bifido. I'm going to check with my doctor as well however.  Look forward to your thoughts!",

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

Easily congested.\nI have PIE and redness, but I don't have much dark spots or discoloration (aside from what's left behind after eczema flared ups) \n\nAlso I live in a dry, hot climate where the sun is really harsh.\n\n\n📈 **About the charts (slide 2 and 3)**:\n\n\n0 means least of the \"title\" and 5 means most of the \"title\"; like \"thickness\" is rated 1 means it's not a thick toner, and is really watery.\n\n\n🧴 **Coming to the product:**\n\n\n- Name: Skin1004 madagascar centella tone brightening boosting toner.\n\n- Period of usage: 1 month\n\n\n- I use it in the morning in this routine:\nCleanse (Benzoyl peroxide cleanser) > Toner 1 (isntree green tea fresh toner) > Toner 2 (this skin1004 toner) > Moisturise > Sunscreen\n\n\n> Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Betaine, Allantoin, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Water, Glucose, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n- Fungal acne safe: YES ✅\n\n\n💭 **My thoughts:**\n\n\nWhen I first saw the product the ingredients list looked promising, but i couldn't find much on reddit about it. I use skinsort a lot though (it's an app where you can check whether a product is fungal acne safe or not) and I looked up this product there and the reviews were really good so I ended up ordering it!\n\n\nThis did not disappoint! I think you can get a fair idea of how I feel about the products through the charts that I have attached, but it's really good and it suits my skin well. It's hydrating, soothing, quick absorbing and it works. Also, it mildly exfoliates the skin but it's not too much and in my opinion it's safe for everyday use! \n\n\nI have used skin1004's tone brightening ampoule too, and I like it but I like this toner WAY more than that ampoule, and in my opinion it works better than the ampoule. Plus if you look up the ampoule on reddit many people have said it broke them out, and I suspect the ampoule was breaking me out too, but I didn't have any such issue with this toner.\n\n\nOverall, I would rate it 4.5/5, will keep repurchasing it. Also, i can tell this will last a while because I have been using it almost everyday, and I layer it twice, but I've only used up the amount you see in the picture so 👀\n",

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\n🌟 **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\n🌟 **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\n🌟 **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\n🌟 **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\n🌟  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\n🌟 **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed! i'll also leave my current routine in the comments below, for those who may be interested. i hope this was of some help to y'all :-), and that all of you would have good health during this period!",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO. My skin is drier in the winter and oily in the summer.**\n\nThe hyperlinked ingredients will take you to CosDNA analysis of each product.\n\n***PRODUCTS: ALL DO NOT HAVE FRAGRANCE ❤***\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_fe18517608.html) Water, Methylpropanediol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Betaine, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium PCA, Phytosqualane, Isostearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethylcellulose, Propanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n* **Review:** *I have used this for the past 6 months, and I can say this gel-cream really shines in the summer for daytime use. It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

    "body": "Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here, I hope I'm doing the review correctly. I purchased this product a few months ago in the hopes of clearing up my PIH and so far, I find quite efficacious. \n\n**Skin profile**: Type- Oily, sensitive and prone to acne\nTone- medium (I use Maybelline Fit Me 220)\n**Skin concerns**:hyperpigmentation, acne, clogged pores. \n**Climate and season**:Tropical, summer (very hot and humid) \n**Product**: Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion (light) \n**Ingredients**: Water, Glycerin, Methylpropaned Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Diglycerin, Glycera Betaine, Trehalose, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose E Alpha-Arbutin, Chlorphenesin, Polysorbate 20. Hydro Lecithin, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Metabisulfite, Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbic Acid, Resveratrol \n\n*Review*\n\n**Smell**: It is fragrance-free which is great for my sensitive skin. I can't detect any scent otherwise.\n**Texture**: Quite runny. It absorbs readily into the skin but leaves a very slight sticky feel.\n**Application**: I pour some into my palm, then spread it evenly on my skin, both on my face and body. \n**Length of use**: 3 months\n\nMy skin is recovering from acne, so I'm dealing with PIH and uneven texture. I thought this looks like it would help, seeing as it has niacinamide high up in the ingredient list, which has helped a lot with my hyperpigmentation before. I am quite pleased with the results. It definitely helped to fade my PIH. I had a huge pimple on my thigh which left behind a large purplish-brown spot. I applied the product every night on the spot and the discoloration has faded considerably. It's not completely gone but only 1-2 shades darker than my skin. The lotion also made my skin soft and overall brighter and smoother. \n\n Would definitely repurchase!",

I always assumed it was hormonal or from talking on the phone or something.\n\nI was using some Crest toothpaste that contained sodium laurel sulfate and cocamidopropyl betaine and switched to one that didn't contain sulfates, but still contained cocamidopropyl betaine (it was [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Crest-White-Luxe-Glamorous-Toothpaste/dp/B009PIJLMQ)) after someone mentioned switching toothpastes on here. My chin cleared up a little bit, but not a huge amount. I had fewer cystic pimples but still a lot of superficial breakouts.\n\nThen, when I traveled abroad this summer, I switched to a random toothpaste I found in a Bulgarian grocery store (it's called Dentalux, [here's](http://i.imgur.com/H13pDGi.jpg?2) the ingredients) that contains neither sulfates nor cocamidopropyl betaine. I've been using that for about a month and my chin has almost completely cleared up! It's amazing.\n\nThen I visited my boyfriend last week and used his toothpaste (Sensodyne Pronamel), which contains no sulfates but does contain cocamidopropyl betaine, and I got a few superficial breakouts in the same area on my chin again. But they've been clearing up easily since I switched back to the Dentalux toothpaste.\n\nSo anyways. There was some discussion a while ago about coconut-based ingredients like cocamidopropyl betaine and how they might cause irritation or breakouts for some people, and since it's a common ingredient in toothpaste apparently, if you have persistent chin breakouts, you might want to try to track down a sulfate and cocamidopropyl betaine free toothpaste!\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I hope this helps someone! :)\n\n**edit for more details:** The Dentalux toothpaste I've been using is [this one](http://www.lidl.de/de/Stiftung-Warentest/dentalux-COMPLEX-3-MINT-FRESH), and it's a store brand from Lidl, which is a European grocery chain. For those looking for options in the US, [this](http://www.tomsofmaine.com/products/slsfree/product-details/clean-and-gentle-care-sls-free-anticavity-plus-whitening-fluoride-toothpaste) Tom's of Maine toothpaste doesn't contain any of the ingredients mentioned above but still contains flouride.",

    "body": "I've been making a \"shopping list\" in combing various sources from Doctor's Forums talking about how to treat various vaccine related syndromes, in the absence of any guidance, and how to detox from the vaccine, to various talks by scientists and doctors about prevention and early treatment of COVID-19. Whenever they go into recommendation mode, I grab my pen and write it down. No I don't have the supporting research on these products, but that's done easily enough if you want to know more about any particular item. This is a very select list, but could be added to or modified easily enough.\n\nI already have over half of everything on this list.\n\nJust offering it to be most helpful, whether you're single or double dose vaccinated or unvaccinated, since it makes little difference in the spread and contraction of the disease \\[see Israel\\] where it's always wise to be prepared and where it can be said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nHope you find it helpful to find everything in one place.\n\nQuality Multivitamin-Mineral Supplement Daily - to cover the basics, minimally.\n\nB12 (naturally derived entire B-complex, ideal).\n\nMethyltetrafolate or 5-MTHF (folate).\n\nGlutathione - 5-MTHF helps the body produce it I think. Check that - NAC does.\n\nAlpha Lipoic Acid - a chelating agent.\n\nNAC or N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine. precursor of Glutathione.\n\nNAD - nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Can get as a supplement, Tru Niagen, who have a patent on a related molecule that causes it to be produced in much larger quantities in the body.\n\nNMN - Nicotinamide Mononucleotide. Note: NMN and NAD are one of the only proven anti-ageing compounds, along with the type II diabetic drug Metformin. Mice lived up to like a THIRD longer lifespan. Both are fairly expensive not too too bad, but once you have it, you have the best of the best. Repairs telomeres. Very good thing to take with Aulterra, to get the DNA repairing and oscillating. Good for long life and a more youthful appearance.\n\nDMG - Dimethylglycine OR Betaine - Trimethylglycine. (detox agents), not an &/or but OR, one or the other.\n\nLysine. Great for vision-related issues.\n\nSelenium. Detox agent. Milk Thistle - also good for liver detox.\n\nEchinacea Purpurea - wards off upper respiratory viral infection.\n\nQuercetin - bioflavindoid and antioxident - also a **Zinc Ionophore**. Science > [https://youtu.be/ey10QMPW9Ic](https://youtu.be/ey10QMPW9Ic)\n\nVitamins D, C, Zinc, and A - which may bind to Ace 2 receptors and steal them away from the virus' spike, and vitamin K2.\n\nNote: Liposomal C is best. With covid symptom onset, could take 10 grams without getting diarrhea. Perfectly absorbed by the body. Almost as good as an IV dose.  C, like D, and Zinc, kicks covid ass.\n\nNote RE: Zinc: Zinc + Zinc ionophore ie: Quercetin, HCQ or IVM, works via inhibition of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (don't ask me). HALTS viral replication in other words.\n\nCopper - 2-3mg/day either chelated or glycinate. When taking regular Zinc it's important to take Copper as well to avoid anemia, which isn't good for Covid. Like Zinc, Copper is also a powerful anti-viral, and may function in the same way relative to Quercetin as Zinc, given their proximity on the periodic table.\n\nIron - to support hemoglobin and prevent anemia. Note: Stop taking it if you get covid, something I read somewhere that it could feed the virus' attack on hemoglobin.\n\nMagnesium - unless you're on a cholesterol lowering statin.\n\nResveratrol.\n\nPomegranate Seed Oil.\n\nCurcumin - Studies have shown that it's surprisingly effective as part of an early treatment protocol.\n\nMelatonin - powerful immunoregulator. Deeper sleep also boosts the immune system. Metabolized by the Pineal Gland. No worries about tolerance, etc. 3-5mg/night.\n\nAspirin - low dose, with covid, full dose (have on hand).\n\nGreen Tea ECGC.\n\nNascent Iodine. Super immune system and energy booster. Thyroid gland metabolizes it perfectly without any sort of dependency forming. Eats it like it made it itself.\n\nAulterra - from a company called Harmonic Innerprizes (I have no interest). Neutralization and elimination of graphene oxide nanoparticles from the vaccine (what the PEG or polyethylene glycol is for). Renders metals chemically inert.\n\nShilajit - Pure Himalayan - great brain detox.\n\nAny quality supplements or fruits and veggies with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant elements and properties. If God made it, eat it. If man made it, lay off, at least as much as possible. Will lose the taste and desire for it after a while, the processed foods.\n\n================================================================\n\nCOVID-19 Disease Medical Treatment - Prescriptions Needed from Dr. (to avoid hospitalization).\n\nNote: Omicron has altered the equation, without the risk that was incurred with Delta variant when this was written.\n\n**If you get covid** and test positive (at home tests coming soon), while this is almost certain to prevent a progression to the point of hospitalization (where risk of death is too high, since more often than not they're following the Fauci-NIH protocol for hospitals, which is outmoded and outdated and leads to intubation and death, as we know, where they're doing much the same things this time as they did last year - no TREATMENT), suggest getting your Doctor to prescribe:\n\nClarithromycin. - Best antibiotic with the best coverage and the lowest risk factor. Superior to Z-Pak or Doxycyline.\n\nFull dose Aspirin. (OTC) - Wards off thrombosis, well ahead of the curve. A further anti-clotting agent if symptoms worsen.\n\nColchicine - Largely unheard of, it's an anti-inflammatory generally prescribed for gout. Very effective and helpful. Doctor won't have a problem prescribing it.\n\nBudesonide, w Nebulizer. - Corticosteroid prescribed to asthmatics. 2 Oxford Studies showed a fully NINETY percent efficacy in preventing the need for hospitalization.\n\nPrednisone - Oral steroid. NOT Dexamethyzone which like Remdesivir is hard on the kidneys and leads to renal failure.\n\nRegeneron infusion, if needed. Best received within 8 days of symptom onset.\n\n@ Home O2, if needed. CPAP, for sleeping, with auto-feature that paces breathing, setting set at something like a 4 (no sleep lab, just temporary), from which it can step up and down within a range.\n\nZinc Sulphate - 120mg. Quercetin (Zinc Ionophore) - double your dosage to two 500's/day.\n\nIvermectin - if you can get it (there's a link below to actually be in a position to acquire it, particularly with a covid diagnosis).\n\nPulse Oximeter.  - for measuring Osat.\n\nThermometer - to monitor temperature.\n\nDo not just lie in bed getting sicker and sicker as the viral load increases. Some people when they present at emerge were sent home, only to return and die on a ventilator, unnecessarily.\n\nIf Regeneron isn't readily available due to Federal restrictions (they're doling it out and attempting to take over distribution from the States), you should be able to get it shipped in right away for an infusion.\n\nAnd that's that. No one should be dying, or getting medically murdered indirectly or directly through a lack of and deprivation of effective and early treatment, and prevention, due to the near exclusive emphasis on the vaccine \"countermeasures\" to the detriment of early and effective treatment and therapeutics.\n\nAnd if you've been vaccinated or twice vaccinated - this ought to help you with any detox regimen to ward off any adverse effects, either now or in the future. Brain fog. Lethargy?\n\nMay you be blessed (not blessed be),\n\nOO\n\nPoint of ref: [https://c19early.com/](https://c19early.com/)\n\nEdit to add: I made another, similar post in a comment in another thread, which includes detailed instructions for **nose (nasopharynx) and mouth hygiene**. Snoot spray, twice a day, in order to keep covid at bay.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qra3cy/sars\\_covid19\\_prevention\\_early\\_treatment\\_via\\_daily/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qra3cy/sars_covid19_prevention_early_treatment_via_daily/)\n\n===============================================================\n\nEdit 2: Adding to List\n\nMonolaurin. from coconut.\n\nAstragalus.\n\n**Andrographis** \\- early covid treatment.\n\nAshwagandha.\n\nRed Reishi Mushroom.\n\nCapsaicin (Cayenne)\n\nOlive leaf extract\n\nNote: All these items don't need to be in a single 'stack' but could be used on a rotating stack, also for good health, longevity, and warding off any cancers which is becoming an epidemic itself these days and for all appearances, it's going to get worse. Encourage further research and examination of these.. nutraceuticals.\n\nMay you be blessed (not blessed be),\n\nOO\n\nEdit 3:\n\nAdding to list\n\nAllicin - the active ingredient in Garlic, stablized. Powerful anti-microbial, antibacterial and antiviral properties. Kills MRSA staphylococcus aureus fungal infection (Hospitals take note?). A must add item.\n\nEdit 4:\n\nElderberry.\n\nGinseng.\n\nGinkgo Biloba.\n\nOmega 3 fish oil.\n\nCalanus finmarchicus oil or Calanus Oil - Pure Astaxanthin ie: Super Krill Oil (not as strong) or Arctic Ruby Oil (the best - Calanus). Astaxanthin is the red in it, same with Krill Oil. Superior Omega 3.\n\nNote: These fatty-lipids form a large part of cell walls and thus bolster cellular heath and strength. Coconut oil is also good.\n\nProbiotics - the better the better.\n\nFull Spectrum Enzymes - same.\n\nFenugreek.\n\nFamotidine aka Pepcid AC - (with covid).\n\nOil of Oregano. - Taken daily - powerful anti-viral. Strongly recommended in little capsule form. Maybe produces a couple of oil of oregano burps but otherwise don't taste it strongly. You can tell it's potent though.\n\nC-60 Olive Oil. - Research this! It's amazing. That soccer ball shaped molecule will sweep up pathogens and toxins and allow the body to eliminate them. Super powerful detox.\n\nCannabis - Cannabinoids - not just CBD or THC (from smoking it), but the whole spectrum of over 100 cannabinoids ie: through edibles or a distilled tincture of some kind that does not use alcohol or anything destructive. See info on endocannabinoid system. Again, not CBD oil, which is just one cannabinoid of 120 or just THC (the active ingredient that gets people \"high\"). All indication is that this would have a powerful preventative and early treatment application as it relates to COVID-19 disease - and anti-cancer prevention and treatment, via the activation of that segment of the immune receptor system, the endocannabinoid system.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nI think it would be worth it but it's up to you obviously, to accumulate pretty much ALL this stuff, and use a kind of rotating stack to get it all in you. It's expensive, yeah, to a degree. I find however that once you start accumulating it, that it becomes like a hobby of sorts whereby getting a new product in is like a little Christmas gift, and the benefits are immense particularly if one adds in good diet, exercise, and more good diet, maybe supplemented with superfood smoothies every now and again. I call it medicinal food. Particularly for those over 40 and 50, regular food will leave you worn down, and susceptible to problems, including loss of energy and.. mojo. It's not enough to put back everything that's been lost and that the body just doesn't produce or extract any more in any meaningful quantity. Can't eat 5 large bowls of fruits and veggies every day!\n\nReplacing stuff and replenishing it, isn't so bad afterwards, cost wise, and after a while, you can start stretching it out, since it's not necessary to take everything every day.\n\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nI linked above to the Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide and how to use that. Weirdly powerful, that stuff. Probably because it cleanses parasites and bacteria, which the human body is infested with, and may be at the very root of most diseases or disorders, including cancer.\n\nNose Gygiene + Lung Cleanse - See > [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qra3cy/sars\\_covid19\\_prevention\\_early\\_treatment\\_via\\_daily/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qra3cy/sars_covid19_prevention_early_treatment_via_daily/)\n\nWater PH and purification is also important, to which a tiny amount of FGH202 can be added, even a little bit of ozone to oxygenate it. Over time, this will alter the PH of your urine and blood. To alter the PH of water, get a tester and just use a very small amount of Baking Soda.\n\nHomeostasis.\n\nDoctors will treat your body like a broken car, but true health involves getting the body into a healing and regenerative state, overall.\n\nGood **gut health** is also vital.\n\nNOTE: A few drops, up to maybe 7 or 8, later, of 33% Food Grade Hydrogen Peroxide in an 8 ounce glass of water has an extraordinary property in being able to re-balance gut health.\n\nVid:  [https://youtu.be/vldZn1BQz0k](https://youtu.be/vldZn1BQz0k)\n\nI might even be beneficial to take an antibiotic, AND, replenish with probiotics simultaneously, to wipe out the bad bacteria and replace it with the good, to get it up to at least to an 80/20 split good/bad bacteria or 70/30 at min. Edit: It appears that 85/15 good/bad, is ideal. Suggest Apple Cider Vinegar every morning (can get in capsule form). And probiotics of course (already mentioned).\n\n**Liver**, the chemical factory. For cleansing and strengthening the liver, the main chemical factory, while **Red Reishi mushroom** is great, a product I'd recommend is called \"**Liver Master**\" (the main ingredient of which is **Milk Thistle**) by a company called PureTrim (where you take a course of it once or twice a year or two boxes of capsules each time, min, 3 max). I have no vested interest. It uses a Mediterranean formula, by an accredited Doctor, and is a great detox. Fairly gentle and not hazardous like chelation, but if you need to eliminate toxins, it works and it may cause you poops to sting the anus a bit for a few days, after which that stops, so you know it works. It does. Liver detox is vital, or you're kind of wasting your money on all the supplements to a degree.\n\nThere's only one more product idea that's surfaced which someone shared with me, that's worth adding to this list.\n\n**Bovine Colostrum** (if you're not allergic to milk) - powerful immune system booster. That'll give you actual antibodies and wipe out bad bacteria and viruses that cause disease.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdding to list\n\nPelargonium Sidoides aka **Umcka** \\- effective and proven (w clinical studies) antiviral remedy for cold and flu viruses.\n\nEdit to add, particularly for those on a budget\n\n**Fire Cider** [https://homesteadandchill.com/how-to-make-fire-cider-for-immune-health/](https://homesteadandchill.com/how-to-make-fire-cider-for-immune-health/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Vax Detox** Update/Note Nov 14th, '21: It's been determined from multiple sources, including Doctors treating vaccine syndromes, that the drug **Ivermectin**, is highly effective for vaccine detox and wiping the spike proteins out of the body, having a number of applicable mechanisms of action.\n\nHow to get Ivermectin: [https://covid19criticalcare.com/ivermectin-in-covid-19/how-to-get-ivermectin/](https://covid19criticalcare.com/ivermectin-in-covid-19/how-to-get-ivermectin/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAdding: Mullein Leaf  (Verbascum thapsus) extract. Like Elderberry, good for the respiratory tract, also has antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral properties.\n\nSince some of these things are for actual respiratory viral and bacterial disease treatment, just having it in you at half or even a quarter of the recommended dosage, ought to function as a powerful preventative measure, while enhancing your health and breathing.\n\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nWhile we're on that - Top 5 herbal supplements for lungs and respiratory infection, including both bacterial and viral.\n\nElderberry - check (already got it)\n\nMullein Leaf - check, just mentioned\n\nGinseng - check\n\nAstragalus - check\n\nEucalyptus - new. is that a supplement too? No. Essential oil only. Not for consumption.\n\nSince that's come up, **highly recommend** getting a **cool mist diffuser** and using a food grade hydrogen peroxide concentration slightly more diluted than that described here in the link below, or using the .1 (point one or 1/10 of 1%) described earlier for the nebulizer (with a touch of pink Himalayan salt).\n\n[https://www.leaf.tv/articles/hydrogen-peroxide-therapy-using-a-cool-mist-humidifier/](https://www.leaf.tv/articles/hydrogen-peroxide-therapy-using-a-cool-mist-humidifier/)\n\nTo this, I would then add fresh drops of the Eucalyptus essential oil, along with a drop or two of Ravensara Aromatica, the most powerful anti-viral of the essential oils, and 1 or 2 drops of Frankincense, which is a lung and gastrointestinal tract cleanser AND an immune system booster.\n\nSo if you really can't afford the other stuff, except the basic vitamins widely recommended ie: Zinc, D, C, this is what I'd recommend the most, to have that in your home. Very affordable. I prefer the intermittent ones to make the water preparation last longer.\n\nGet a cold or flu of any kind? Put that beside your bed first night.\n\nUsed periodically, however, as a preventative measure would be best, say once a day or every second day.\n\nNote: Nothing in this is about being terribly afraid of covid or afraid of it at all, but is all about the complete elimination of any such fear or anxiety, so as to be able to forget about it, while staying healthy with things like \"super cold\" going around and whatnot. Also highly anti-cancer, anti-disease, pro-superhealth, all of it.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Edit/Note: **Carbon 60 (C60) Olive Oil**, is I think, the most powerful detox and longevity thing I've discovered and for healing from the abuse of toxins, for years. 100ml or 3.5 Oz's is about $40-50.00. This should/could then be added or infused into MCT Oil, which is affordable in volume, & say added to a smoothie recipe.\n\nThe rats lived NINETY % longer! Not kidding.\n\n[https://www.sesres.com/what-is-c60-olive-oil/17387/](https://www.sesres.com/what-is-c60-olive-oil/17387/)\n\nOn top of NMN, NAD, and Metformin, for longevity, this is the greatest longevity molecule known to man, from what I can tell.\n\nAlso known as Buckminsterfullerene, for the soccer ball shape of the C-60 molecule. This is like the God supplement, shaped like the universe itself (some think). Roll these through your heart and liver, and you will live long and prosper! V\n\nNote: Most disease is inflammation related, and due in many ways to the body being a host to untold negative bacteria, fungi and parasites. Clear those out and the stage is set for homeostasis, and longevity, without disease. C60 Oil rolls them all in, then eliminates them. There's no escape for them. Vacuums them right up and away they go.\n\nCan't put a price on that, imho. Most highly recommended.\n\nBe blessed. Pay it forward! >\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAdding: Sarracenia Purpurea - Purple Pitcher Plant Herbal Extract.\n\nGrape Seed Extract - new major longevity molecule discovered in it, which dramatically extended the life of mice. Cheap. Powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSpike protein detox guide\n\n[https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/resources/spike-protein-detox-guide/](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/resources/spike-protein-detox-guide/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBlack Seed Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------\n\nIntermittent fasting. Very helpful, including in rebuilding the immune system, which this will help facilitate. Perhaps some of that fire cider during a fast might be ok.\n\nAdding: Shilajit, if I didn't already. Either Himalayan or Siberian Golden Mountain. Pure. Certified. Contains over 85 trace minerals. Was discovered when monkeys were licking it off of rocks in the Himalayas. It's like some sort of ancient botanical blood-oil of the Earth.",

My igG levels were elevated, meaning my infection was current at the time. \n\nYou can purchase this antibodies test here: \n\nhttps://requestatest.com/candida-iga-igm-igg-blood-test\n\r\n1)\tMy Story & Symptoms\n\r\nTo start, I am going to say I am relatively young. I am 29 years old, in case you were curious. I currently reside in upstate South Carolina. However, that’s neither nor there. I will say my issues first began back in December of 2022, if not a couple of months before that. I began getting a lot of uncomfortable symptoms – bloating, indigestion, acid reflux, constipation, diarrhea, hair loss, a constant fluctuation between weight loss and weight gain, floaters in my eyes, anxiety, muscle pain, etc. You name it, I probably had it. I worked at a local elementary school at the time as a teacher assistant until my health declined and I eventually quit. I was miserable, and hopeless, and I didn’t know what was going on. Thinking back on it now, I think I may know what caused, or at least, played a HUGE part, in the development of my issues. \r\n\nThe elementary school I worked at was veryyyy old. Like, “built-in-the-early-1900s” old. I didn’t think anything of it at the time. However, it makes sense now. I was an assistant to a wonderful kindergarten teacher, and she had very bad asthma. When I first met her, she had been using a steroid inhaler on and off for a long time, and at that point, had been teaching in that old school building for about 5-6 years. Her and I ended up developing a lot of the same symptoms and I noticed that, when I spoke to her, she often misremembered my name and referred to me as “Jennifer” instead of “Jessica”. It was strange. These past few days have given me some clarity and I now believe that her and I may have gotten a mold toxicity from the classroom that we taught in. Do I think she could possibly have a fungal lung infection, if not something more serious? Most definitely. Her daughter works at a local Publix near me, so I did manage to seek her out today and tell her about my illness so that she could pass the info along to her mom, my former coworker/teacher. I’m just hoping that she heeded my pleas for her to further pursue the fungal lung infection route. It’s totally up to them whether they decide to act. I came from a place of love, and a genuine desire, to help people like her and others in our situation.\n\r\nI believe I may have mistakenly done other things that contributed to my fungal overgrowth. I was on birth control for about two to three years – I used to be a heavy wine drinker – had so many prolonged periods of stress in my life – used a PPI for a couple of years, with doctors thinking I had high stomach acid levels, which is obviously not the case, and ate so many shitty foods that I would typically end every day looking like I was pregnant. In addition, I rotated steroids and antibiotic usage on and off (under the guidance of a physician).  I would eat take-out food almost daily. ALL of these habits can contribute to fungal overgrowth. If you do any of these things, you need to nip them in the bud immediately if you want to get better permanently. Because if you don’t, your overgrowth will never go away. Please don’t be like me and suffer needlessly. I am sharing my story so that you don’t have to go through the same shit that I did. If you live or work in an old building, PLEASE have it investigated for mold. Fungal lung infections are rare but they can happen. If you drink alcohol, stop or limit your intake as much as you can. If you get stressed constantly, find ways to relax – stimulating the vagus nerve is a GREAT way to do this. Try doing hobbies that you love, or singing along to songs in the car while you’re driving; these are two great ways to stimulate the vagus nerve and relax. There are ways to ‘reset’ this nerve. Look it up on YouTube. I remember doing one of those ‘reset’ exercises one day and even ended up having a bowel movement hours later. No lie! There’s a doctor on YouTube that shows you how to ‘reset’ this nerve to help with constipation. See here: https://youtu.be/1OAJvzz4Yf0?si=CbN42ibsup-wHZYD\n\r\nDiaphragmatic breathing is also another great technique to calm yourself down. Smoking may also contribute to candida overgrowth. If you have a poor diet, your immune system may be weak, possibly exposing yourself to opportunistic infections like candida overgrowth. Try incorporating foods from as many food groups as possible so that you can rebuild your gut microflora with as many strains of good bacteria as possible. I would wait until you are far along in your protocol, however. Wait until then – when your die-off symptoms become less severe – and experiment, seeing what foods benefit you and which ones do not. \n\r\nPlease don’t be like me. Please. I don’t want you suffering. I spent the last year in and out of the hospital, wasting ER doctors’, and my, time, and spent needless amounts of money that didn’t need to be spent. I had so much bloodwork done, hopping from specialist to specialist, and a lot of said blood tests came back normal aside from some strange readings regarding my neutrophil, glucose, and ketone levels, which are supposedly all connected to candida overgrowth. High ketones in the urine means that you likely have a low white blood cell count, and a low white blood cell count means that there are less beneficial cells that fight off the candida. High ketones also usually correlate with elevated glucose levels as well. And when your glucose levels are high, the candida is harder to eradicate as it feeds off the body’s glucose/sugar supply. \n\r\n2)\tTreatment \n\r\nIf you want to effectively treat your candida overgrowth, don’t go in “guns blazing” like I did. I went in a little too hard on my protocol, and ended up getting kidney and liver pain multiple times. You don’t want to overburden either organ. They place such a vital role in the body’s detoxing mechanisms that their value can’t be understated. I highly recommend getting your liver and kidneys checked every couple of weeks, especially if you decide to use prescription antifungals. If you don’t have a doctor, there are tests you can order yourself like the following: \r\n\nhttps://www.allergytest.co/product/kidney-function-test/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAzJOtBhALEiwAtwj8tnKXFIF9Jct1BF0h0Ls_gfuVKfD40aZeYCMOySxOT7JXYvQhDUsu0hoCXcMQAvD_BwE\r\n\nhttps://www.ultalabtests.com/test/hepatic-function-panel?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAzJOtBhALEiwAtwj8tiKPeQABmKs2HSyxJtjM0luZGZkhSikUhV-gPtgFsUnpb-AS1-vu0hoCWJQQAvD_BwE\r\n\nAlso, get your thyroid levels checked every so often. When candida dies, it creates oxidative stress in your body. Remember, oxidative stress happens when your body doesn’t have enough antioxidants to fight off infections. One of the most common symptoms of too much oxidative stress is when your lymph nodes get swollen/clogged up (your lymph nodes are located in your armpits, neck, groin area, chest, etc). Drinking water and staying hydrated (or sweating) will help get rid of these excess toxins and prevent them from circulating around in your bloodstream. Too much oxidative stress can cause premature aging and cancer over time. This is why it’s important to supplement with iodine to support your lymphatic system. PLEASE CHECK to see if you are low in iodine before you start supplementing, however. Iodine toxicity is very real and can be dangerous if your body gets too much of it. You can test for iodine levels here: \n\r\nhttps://www.ultalabtests.com/test/iodine-serum-plasma?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA75itBhA6EiwAkho9e30cqpCzkFLMhmypRPGxVprdXhbEs7hkkQxAJEeIDpZdgJYefghE3hoChOIQAvD_BwE\r\n\nIf you are low in iodine, be sure to consult your physician to supplement accordingly. \n\r\nYou can buy a thyroid function test here: \r\nhttps://www.questhealth.com/product/thyroid-tsh-function-test-36127M.html\n\r\nI would also get your electrolytes tested every so often as well. I have been hospitalized multiple times for this. It’s no joke and can easily become life-threatening if it’s not taken care of. You can buy electrolyte tests here: \n\r\nhttps://www.walkinlab.com/products/view/electrolyte-blood-test-panel\r\n\nhttps://www.walkinlab.com/products/view/magnesium-serum-test\n\r\nI think the most important thing I am going to say in this wall of text is to….TEST! TEST! TEST! The most common mistake that I see on this subreddit is that people end up treating only their symptoms and not their cause. For example, people love discussing what antifungals they use. Great. But WHAT made them have their candida symptoms in the first place? Do they drink? Have a nutritional deficiency? Smoke? Are constantly stressed? Use PPIs? Use birth control? Live in an old, moldy home or work in an old building? Have a poor diet? Are exposed to heavy metals (found in junk food like candy, for example)? If you do any of those things, kick the habit to the curb or try to reduce it as much as possible. The mold issue gets a little more difficult because you have to do additional testing for it - whether it’s in your home, place of work, car, etc. \r\nI have done a lot of research and have found that candida may be linked to the following vitamin/mineral deficiencies or imbalances: A/B complex (not every B vitamin, but I would get all of your B levels checked to be safe - see this link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023522/ ), vitamin C/D/E/K, iron, manganese, iodine, selenium, magnesium, potassium, chloride, and sodium. Candida can also cause histamine issues and other health disorders, and can also deplete the body of various fatty acids such as omega 3.\n\r\nHere are the following tests I ordered:\n\r\n- GI map\n\r\nhttps://mylabsforlife.com/lab-test/gi-map-diagnostic-solutions/\n\r\n- Organic acids test\n\r\nhttps://truehealthlabs.com/product/organic-acids-urine-test/\n\r\n- Histamine intolerance test\n\r\nhttps://requestatest.com/histamine-intolerance-test\n\r\n- Heavy metals panel toxicity test (I recommend doing a hair test over a blood test, however - more accurate. A blood test only shows if you've been exposed to heavy metals in the last 3 months):\n\r\nhttps://www.ultalabtests.com/test/heavy-metals-panel-blood\n\nhttps://spectrumawakening.com/products/heavy-metal-hair-test-great-plains-international-only?_pos=1&_sid=dc73c00d4&_ss=r\n\nIf you test positive for heavy metal toxicity, and you don't know how to do a detox yourself, you can use binders such a activated charcoal, zeolite, etc, to help \"sweep up\" the heavy metals and get them out of your body. Foods such as cilantro, broccoli, eggs, etc can help your body naturally detox heavy metals as well! Lemon water is also great for this!\n\nHere is a list of 7 foods that can naturally detox your body of heavy metals: \n\nhttps://loovfood.com/7-foods-that-help-you-to-detox-from-harmful-heavy-metals/#:~:text=Greens%20are%20some%20of%20the,levels%2C%20and%20purifies%20blood%20cells.\n\nIf you can afford it, I recommend doing a detox under the guidance of a naturopath or functional medicine doctor. Unfortunately, mainstream doctors do not know anything about doing heavy metal/mold detoxing, though. \n\r\n- Mold toxicity/mycotoxin test\n\r\nhttps://mosaicdxinternational.com/products/mx-mycotox-profile-mold-exposure\n\nIf you live or work in an old building or drive a car, please, PLEASE look into getting inspected for mold! Sometimes a mold inspection company might miss certain strains of mold when they test, so it's good to follow up with a ERMI test on your own accord. Unfortunately the test is not cheap - it can cost upwards of $240 or more. I see this test being mentioned a lot on the [r/ToxicMoldExposure](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicMoldExposure) subreddit, and it is considered the gold standard for testing your home for mold. There is even an add-on you can get that detects candida auris in your home - one of the deadliest, if not the most deadly, type of candida fungus. To test, you send in a dust sample obtained from a duster or a vacuum. \n\nDefinitely worth the purchase. Buy it here: \n\nhttps://www.envirobiomics.com/product/ermi/?v=9ab44377c35e\n\r\n- Omega 3 index plus test (measures omega 3/omega 6 ratio in the body, and checks the other fatty acid levels): \n\r\nOmega Quant Omega-3 Index Complete - Complete Fatty Acid Profile Blood Test Kit | Includes - Omega-3s, Omega-6s, Saturated Fats, Monounsaturated fats, Trans Fats | 1 Complete Home Kit https://a.co/d/0Tp7yE3\n\r\n- Mineral tests such as manganese, copper, selenium, iodine and iron (some of these were ordered through my primary care doc) - however, a hair heavy metals test should check for these. \n\nhttps://spectrumawakening.com/products/heavy-metal-hair-test-great-plains-international-only?_pos=1&_sid=dc73c00d4&_ss=r\n\r\n- Vitamin tests such as vitamin A/B complex/C/D/E/K through my primary care doctor or here: \n\nhttps://requestatest.com/ultimate-vitamin-deficiency-panel-Vitamin-b12-D-K1-A-C-B1-B6-Folate-blood-test\n\n^ Looks like that's missing some vitamins, but, it's a start! Request a Test has the other individual missing vitamins. \n\r\n- Haven't found any relation of this to candida development but wanted to get it tested anyway because a lot of Americans are deficient in this and it relates to nervous system health: choline\r\n\nhttps://requestatest.com/cholinesterase-plasma-rbc-blood-test\n\r\n- TRIO smart breath test...unfortunately for a lot of people who have SIFO (small intestinal fungal overgrowth), they often have SIBO as well so I ordered a breath test to see if I have it. Holding off on this one though because it uses different types of sugars for the testing process. Yay 🤪\r\nhttps://www.triosmartbreath.com/orderonline\n\r\nI did manage to do all of these tests (aside from the SIBO breath test), the at-home tests I ordered, as well as the in-person ones. Once the bulk of my results start coming back, I will update you all in another post. \n\r\n(I can’t wait until the troll comments start flooding in. These tests are “snake oil”!!! That’s what a lot of doctors want you to believe. These tests that I provided are detailed, comprehensive tests that help people get to the cause of their issues and help them recover completely. What does a complete recovery mean for mainstream doctors? Patients recover = less patients to treat = less money. That’s exactly what a lot of big companies DON’T want. They need constant profit to stay in business. Can’t do so if everyone is getting better and not needing treatment!) Think about it--- do you usually see the same people stick around on the Candida subreddit? Not usually, no. People who end up ordering in-depth tests like the organic acids test discover important information they didn’t know before and are able to correct their candida issues and put it in remission. Why hang around the candida subreddit if you’re better? Some food for thought. \n\r\nAgain, I can’t stress enough how important it is to test. Once you know what the root cause of your candida is, you can attack the problem directly, recognize your symptoms, and prevent relapse. Remember, candida cannot be cured because it naturally resides in its yeast form in our gut. When there is something that is unbalanced in our bodies, that is when the yeast converts to its fungal form and attacks the host.\n\r\nI am a little over beyond 1 month into my protocol and have seen good results. Not because I went in “guns blazing”, mind you, but because I based my protocol around things I could correct to prevent my candida from getting worse – correcting my nutritional deficiencies, stopping PPI/birth control/alcohol use, reducing stress, removing myself from that moldy school building, etc. I have seen my candida infection reduce significantly. While I am not completely better yet, I am feeling so much better than I did seven months ago. \n\r\nThings like diet are SO important in keeping the overgrowth at bay. The candida diet eliminates one important item from your day-to-day eating habits – sugar – the one ingredient that candida loves. It’s no surprise a lot of people lose weight on this diet. If you are wanting to gain weight back, focus on eating a diet high in fats and proteins. However, do not rely on the candida diet alone to put your overgrowth into remission. No. \n\nYour protocol will also NOT be as effective without biofilm busters. What is a biofilm buster, you ask? A biofilm is a slimy-like substance that microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi use to protect themselves whenever they perceive that a threat is attacking them. Biofilm busters do exactly as their namesake says… they break through these biofilms to kill the fungi. I’ve had great success using biofilm busters such as NAC, Biocidin by Biocidin Botanicals (they also make a liposomal version, which is great for the body infected by systemic candida- i.e. candida that infects multiple organs), apolactoferrin from Jarrow Formulas, and SFI Health’s Interfase Plus. Apolactoferrin helps break down iron stored by these biofilms and allows the host to reabsorb the much-needed iron, which was initially depleted by the candida. Interfase Plus DOES deplete the body of essential electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and magnesium, so make sure you’re hydrating with these if you decide to take that biofilm buster. I don’t believe that fungi develop a true “resistance” to antifungal meds. I just think it’s a matter of taking enough biofilm busters, especially as many as you can tolerate at once, to break through the hard-to-reach biofilms. I recommend following a diet is high in protein and contains low-starchy vegetables - this way will allow you to prevent you from making your infection worse. Make sure the meat/eggs you get are PASTURE-RAISED, grass-fed animals!!! This kind of meat is the purest form of meat you can get; you do NOT want to put more toxins in your body!\n\r\nI think it’s understated how important it is to hydrate too, especially when you take your herbal and/or prescription antifungals. When you keep yourself hydrated, the candida do not thrive as much, and you are able to constantly flush out the very toxins that it releases and prevent your liver from kicking into overdrive. It’s completely okay to take breaks in between detox sessions. If you can, try taking a day or two off from the antifungal usage and stay hydrated and well-nourished. Your body will thank you. \n\r\nWhen you experience die-off symptoms, do you know why you feel drunk? It’s because candida, when it dies, releases acetaldehyde, which is the very same neurotoxin that the liver releases when you’re hungover. That’s maybe why you may feel tingling/numbness in your extremities too. Candida releases about 60-70 other toxins into the body as well, and that can cause worsening symptoms like hair loss, heightened anxiety, teeth pain, muscle pain, kidney and liver pain, light sensitivity, floaters in eyes, etc. It's completely normal to experience worsening symptoms before they get better. However, this is where the importance of hydrating or sweating those toxins out, comes in. Doing either one of those things will help your body flush out the toxins a lot faster and make your die-off symptoms less severe. Supplements like milk thistle and molybdenum can help your liver detox more effectively while antioxidants like NAC, acetyl l-carnitine, CoQ10, etc, can help your body create white blood cells to fight off the free radicals released by the candida and give you more energy. Glutathione is another great antioxidant. Don’t forget to use binders like zeolite, spirulina, activated charcoal, etc, to help your body “sweep” up the toxins. I would use these about 2 hours after your dose of antifungals so that the antifungals don’t get absorbed by the binders. Be sure to drink plenty of water so that you don’t end up constipated as well. \n\r\nDo I recommend certain supplements? Heck yes I do. I had GREAT results with Metagenics’ Candibactin AR + BR. I got intense die-off for the first couple of weeks and passed so much impacted stool and biofilm. No joke. They’re pricy supplements but they have been my go-to supplements since pairing them with the itraconazole and nystatin tablets I’ve been using. By the way, you can get the nystatin tablets from either Apo Health in Germany (as long as it’s a 90 day supply/90 count of the tablets – nothing more) or request a nystatin prescription off of sites like Push Health here in the U.S. I also had great results from neem supplements, Thorne’s undecylenic acid/SF22, and AllicinMax/high potency garlic supplements. There are plenty of other effective antifungals – I highly recommend checking out the different threads in this community about them. A lot of people’s testimonials, about what supplements worked for them, are worth the read. Want to know what I used as part of my protocol? See here: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/s/RBRfmxX6pn\n\r\nAlso, I have some techniques you can use to keep SIBO at bay during your candida protocol. See here: \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/s/K5W55JHQDJ\n\r\n3)\tRebuilding the Microbiome \n\r\nNow, this is another important step in the protocol – rebuilding the microbiome/repairing leaky gut. If you have oral thrush, you likely have it in your throat and in your stomach. The stomach is connected to the esophagus and mouth, after all. That’s what a lot of people on here forget. If you notice that your stomach is distended, especially the lower half of your body, there’s a possibility that you could have SIFO, or small intestinal fungal overgrowth. Yes, it is a real phenomenon, despite a lot of modern medicine doctors claiming it to be “pseudoscience”. When candida takes over the intestine, it burrows into its fat, permeable walls, creating small holes. This why it is so important to kill most of the candida in the intestine before you start to rebuild the microbiome, because, otherwise, the candida will just keep growing back and making your leaky gut worse. I would not recommend starting this part of the protocol until your die-off symptoms are not as severe. This could take weeks or months, depending on the severity of your infection. Here are some great supplements I recommend for healing your leaky gut: \n\r\nL-glutamine: helps repair the stomach and intestinal lining \n\r\nSlippery elm: helps repair the intestinal lining\n\r\nGinger: is considered a prokinetic and helps with digestion \n\r\nArtichoke: is considered a prokinetic and helps with digestion\n\r\nCollagen: can be found in bone broth and helps rebuild the stomach lining. It’s also found in various supplements, often with biotin. (If you have hair loss, you are likely biotin-deficient, so it would be worth supplementing both collagen and biotin once you’re far along in your protocol.) \n\r\nI highly recommend you have, at least, 2-3 bowel movements a day. Or at least one. Otherwise, your stool is just going to sit in your stomach and lead to more potential candida overgrowth. Slow motility, or the passing of stool through the intestine, can also cause SIBO, or small bacterial intestinal overgrowth. Often times, SIBO and SIFO go hand-in-hand. Don’t forget go include probiotics once you are far along your protocol! The following bacteria strains have antifungal qualities, supposedly, so be sure to pick a probiotic with the following strains mentioned in this article: \n\r\nhttps://www.mygenefood.com/blog/which-probiotic-strains-get-rid-of-candida/\r\n\nIf you’re in need of a pick-me-up, I did find a video of a gentleman who was able to put his systemic candida into remission by taking 3 five-day rounds of fluconazole: \n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/0Unvey-XGj8?si=gtB-7yKZT-nC5PS\n\nI included a link that has 10 different supplements that can heal a leaky gut, here: \n\nhttps://www.brightlifeclinic.com/10-supplements-that-provide-health-and-healing-for-leaky-gut/#:~:text=It's%20probably%20not%20a%20supplement,acts%20as%20a%20preventative%20barrier.\n\r\n4)\tMoving Forward\n\r\nIf I were to summarize this post, I would tell you the four most important things to do: 1) Test, 2) treat, 3) hydrate/sweat, and 4) rebuild the microbiome. Doing so will help revert the candida back into beneficial yeast form, help your organs recover faster and more effectively, prevent your fungal infection from coming back, and make your die-off symptoms less severe. I am looking over this document, and it’s currently sitting at 10 pages here in Microsoft Word. This is all lf the information that I’ve spent hours, even days, researching myself. I had to become my own doctor when my own medical professionals failed me, blowing me off, saying it was just “anxiety” or that it was “all-in-my-head”. I had a rough talk with my primary care provider two days ago, and he even told me that he wouldn’t be surprised if I went and got a new doctor because he’s exhausted almost every possible avenue/means of testing, diagnosing, etc. This is where I’m at right now. He has done a lot for me, I can’t emphasize that enough, but on par for the course, he went into the usual spiel of “it’s mostly just anxiety”. He didn’t doubt that I likely contracted mold poisoning from my former place of work. But it’s the constant overreliance on the anxiety angle that is super frustrating to me. Candida can CAUSE ANXIETY!!!!! Medical professionals, especially those who take on a large clientele/patient base, are often only concerned about dollar signs, not in the well-being of their patients. Having a doctor who truly cares or one who wants to get the root cause, with you, is rare in today’s day and age. One has to truly wonder if doctors are there to keep you in a vicious cycle – to keep you on a fine line of being either healthy or sick. Not to help you fully recover. Before all of this shit went down, I believed in our health care system (aside from the outrageous cost of drugs, high deductibles, etc – boy was I ignorant before), but, going through all of this has really opened my eyes. It’s no wonder people have to resort to functional medicine doctors. I have been to specialist after specialist – everyone from a pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, gastroenterologist, rheumatologist, ENT doctor, to dentists and oral surgeons. Not ONE specialist was able to tell me, definitively, that I had thrush or some kind of fungal overgrowth. Not one. Functional medicine doctors take a more progressive approach to their patient care, and it’s a shame that many insurance companies don’t cover them. I never thought I’d see the other “side of the coin”, so to speak. But, reading all of your testimonials, here and on Facebook, and living with this day-to-day, you begin to see things from a different perspective. This stuff changes you. \n\r\n…\n\r\nIf you made it to the end of this post, you are amazing. Thank you. I hope this post was enlightening for you all. I am trying my darndest to share with you all of the information I have gleaned from surfing this Reddit community, through various government-funded studies conducted in the U.S. and beyond, and testimonials found on Facebook and other social media websites. If this post helps just one of you, I’m beyond happy.\n \r\nHere are some last important tidbits/pieces of advice that I forgot to include in my post: \n\r\n-\tCandida supposedly steals iron from the host’s body. This is why a lot of people have success in managing their symptoms by sticking with the carnivore diet. DO NOT FORGET TO TAKE BIOFILM BUSTERS TO MAKE YOUR PROTOCOL MORE EFFECTIVE! REMEMBER TO DETOX YOUR BODY OF HEAVY METALS FIRST, AND THEN START THE BIOFILM BUSTERS! You don't want heavy metals and the acetaldehyde (produced by the candida), floating around your body! You'll just cause more damage in the long run! \n\r\n-\tRemember: candida overgrowth is your body’s way of protecting itself from something toxic – whether it’s mold, heavy metal exposure, etc. I noticed, when I was gone the last few days, that I have been having the most extreme reactions to things like iodine, activated charcoal, fulvic/humic acid, etc. What do these substances all have in common? THEY ARE ALL HEAVY METAL CHELATORS!!!! I am almost positive that my overgrowth was caused by heavy metals and/or mold, if not both. I did get tested for heavy metals via a blood sample, and the results came back normal. However, the gold standard for heavy metals testing is through hair testing, so I did purchase that test as well.\n \r\n-\tI highly recommend getting a portable sauna. That will help you sweat out the toxins in your body and make your die-off reactions less severe. I did initially recommend baths, and they are good if you don’t have any other alternative, however, tapwater can contain toxic chemicals such as heavy metals. Keep that in mind. That’s why buying a shower filter is so important. Don't forget to hydrate with electrolytes as well - you do lose those when you sweat!!!!\n\r\n-\tNow, there isn’t too much evidence to support this, but I believe the liver stores toxins in fat cells when it’s overburdened and cannot detox probably. I think that would explain why people lose weight when they sweat. \n\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6101675/\n\r\nhttps://www.liverdoctor.com/fat-cells-and-toxins/\n\r\n-\tCandida has supposedly been linked with various allergy conditions. \n\r\n-\tArabinogalactan, acacia fiber, and hydrolyzed guar gum contain prebiotic strains of good bacteria that help fight off fungal overgrowth. Florastor is a probiotic that contains a good yeast that helps fight off candida overgrowth. It’s sold at various grocery stores. \n\r\n-\tOzone gas supposedly kills candida albincans, which is the most common form of fungus found in the body. This may explain why I reacted to the ozone produced by my air purifiers last year. I have since been gifted another purifier that does not produce ozone, however. \n\r\n-\tEver been on a PPI and been told you have acid reflux? You most likely don’t. Contrary to popular belief, low stomach acid actually causes acid reflux because when you have low stomach acid, your esophagus does not close and tighten like it should – rather, it sits in a more relaxed state, causing acid to rise back up your throat. Try supplementing with betaine HCL (betaine hydrochloride), as well as zinc carnosine, to boost your stomach acid levels. I initially recommended digestive enzymes like Enzymedica's Digest Gold, however, I hesitate to now. Digest Gold, like other enzymes, contain ones that originate from various mold strains. No thanks! Candida will likely take control of a stomach with low acid levels, so that’s why it’s important to get your acid levels back up! If you have thrush and experience a heartburn-like feeling while taking it, don't fret - it's probably the digestive enzymes, betaine hydrochloride, and zinc carnosine attacking the candida and raising your stomach levels! Keep taking these supplements if you can, and the feeling should go away! It did for me! \n\r\n-\tSSRIs supposedly cause damage to the gut flora. This would explain why some people feel suicidal while on them. The gut microbiome has a HUGE impact on your mental health. A lot of people don’t know that. That’s why some people end up curing their depression by eating healthy and taking probiotics to restore the good bacteria in their GI tract!\n\r\n-\tChlorine can supposedly cause fungal overgrowth. This is why it’s important to use a shower filter that gets the “bad stuff out” and reduce swimming in a chlorinated pool as much as possible. \n\r\n-\tPeople who have fungal lung infections have supposedly had success using PURE, FOOD-GRADE hydrogen peroxide in their nebulizers. FOOD-GRADE hydrogen peroxide only contains three ingredients: hydrogen, oxygen, and deionized water. This type of peroxide does NOT contain the toxic crap that the other store hydrogen peroxide brands have. Food-grade peroxide supposedly has antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal properties. I tried nebulizing this with some saline the other day, and I INSTANTLY felt my lungs clear after an initial die-off reaction. People have had success treating long COVID with this, too. You may experience some throat irritation at first, but that means it’s working its magic and causing a die-off reaction! I recommend starting SLOW and only adding 1-2 drops in your saline nebulizing solution to start! If you have a skin infection caused by candida, you can also try bathing with food grade hydrogen peroxide, too! All you need is 1-2 cups of it in a warm bath (don't forget to buy a shower head filter if you can afford it)!\n\r\nHere is a testimonial about the efficacy of pure, food grade hydrogen peroxide: \r\nhttps://ibb.co/Cwv0WsV\n\nHere is a link on how to flush your sinuses out with PURE, food-grade hydrogen peroxide:\n\nhttps://www.jonkaiser.com/post/flushing-your-sinuses-with-hydrogen-peroxide?postId=9a821027-5b77-494f-9819-b97d24737f3d&utm_campaign=bdb4cd14-c039-49a7-8561-8c6f27afef0b&utm_source=so&utm_medium=mail&utm_content=8989d32c-78dd-44b7-8fdb-044421d402a5&cid=6ce26f30-abaf-4f2c-b998-0bde61e0ca9c&fbclid=IwAR3FugtOjMUAVYaTsV-oEHtSkyhtZpLbaWN1RXa1ny0D43UHk7ADhMGrXrE\n\r\n-\tSome people on CureZone supposedly put their candida overgrowth into remission by doing nystatin enemas or drinking pure grade turpentine (it doesn’t seem like it's harmful to the body in dosages of a teaspoon or less – it’s just resin from the pine tree, after all).  I would only do either one of those things if all else fails, however.\n\nHere is a study on the effectiveness of turpentine: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/41669083_The_essential_oil_of_turpentine_and_its_major_volatile_fraction_a-_and_b-pinenes_A_review\n\nDr. Jennifer Daniels developed a protocol for using turpentine and sugar to draw out and kill candida. You can read more about this protocol here: \n\nhttps://archive.org/stream/turp_candida_daniels/turp_candida_daniels_djvu.txt\n\r\n-\tWant to know what antifungal hygiene products that I use? See here: \n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/s/6OzWmhQFtQ\n\n- If your lymph nodes get swollen when you detox, you could have a hypothyroid, or underactive thyroid issues. Get your iodine levels checked! Iodine deficiencies can cause missed periods, hair loss, cold hands and feet, etc. And guess what? Iodine is responsible for maintaining gastric acid levels in the stomach! So if you're idiodine-deficient, you COULD have low stomach acid!!!!!! Remember to get your iodine and zinc levels checked and supplement with both to get your stomach acid levels up!!! \n\r\n-\tNOTE: Did your MMC, or migrating motility complex, stall, meaning you aren’t having any bowel movements? You probably have too much dead candida/biofilm in your intestines. Candida can cause temporary paralysis of the MMC. Try taking some laxatives to see if you can flush it out. Do NOT FORGET TO REPLENISH THE GOOD BACTERIA/YEAST BY TAKING PROBIOTICS AND FLORASTOR AFTER!!!!!\n\r\nRead more about the MMC here:\n https://www.goodnessme-nutrition.com/sibo/what-is-the-migrating-motor-complex-how-to-fix-it/\n\nApparently, taking vitamin B3 (niacin) can help your body detoxify everything from heavy metals to microplastics. See more here: \n\nhttps://higherdose.com/blogs/news/niacin-101-going-deeper-with-your-detox\n\r\nI hope this post helps, at least, just one person. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. That’s what I’m here for. \n\nREMEMBER: ATTACK THE ROOT CAUSE OF YOUR ISSUES - WHETHER IT IS HEAVY METALS, MOLD TOXICITY, ETC. YOUR CANDIDA PROTOCOL WILL BECOME A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE THAT WAY! CANDIDA IS YOUR BODY'S RESPONSE TO SOMETHING THAT IS-OUT-OF-BALANCE IN YOUR BODY.\n\nSome additional links you may find helpful: \n\nhttps://www.rupahealth.com/post/a-functional-medicine-approach-to-heavy-metal-detoxing\n\nhttp://cancerprogram.weebly.com/8-toxic-interference--candida--mold.html?fbclid=IwAR1HYwGs2EPo9OsbrsLgUSsrxmTKFXeGmDfxenCHZvKm44dtvrVK9kIC-W8\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/p8mmurcs1ss037vujmn6x/Chronic-Illness-Protocol-Latest-Revision-12-13-2023.pdf?rlkey=kvdj5m0ltcorj6n8gkbxvlbh4&dl=0\n\nhttps://mthfr.net/methylation-inhibited-by-candidas-toxin/2012/09/08/\n\nOne Redditor brought up a good point about detoxing your body of heavy metals and killing candida. Chelators like ETDA - found in SFI Health's Interfase Plus - can detox the body of heavy metals AND kill candida in its fungal form. It literally kills two birds with one stone. We don't want candida in its fungal form. We want it in its beneficial yeast form. \n\nIf you have heavy metals, try detoxing first and see if your issue goes away. If it doesn't, feel free to use a biofilm buster and knock that candida right out - don't forget to get to the root cause of the issue, though!\n\nALSO: REMEMBER THAT MOLDS ARE A TYPE OF FUNGUS! TREAT YOUR CAUSE IF IT INVOLVES MOLD - GET YOUR HOME REMIDIATED OR MOVE AWAY. AND DON'T FORGET TO DETOX YOUR BODY OF MOLDS AND TAKE ANTIFUNGALS! \n\nMORE IMPORTANT INFO: \n\nI SPENT THE NIGHT LOOK AT HEAVY METAL/MOLD DETOX POSTS AND I KEEP SEEING THIS EMPHASIZED:\n\nDetox the body of heavy metals/molds first and THEN ATTACK THE CANDIDA!!!!!\n\nADDITIONAL TESTS WORTH LOOKING INTO: \n\nSo I've been digging around the internet for more tests I can do. I found a couple of tests worth mentioning. I am pretty sure I have fungus in my sinuses and/or lungs. I've spit up some rather...interesting things so I thought a sputum/spit culture might be useful. A sputum culture may cultivate a fungi sample, who knows. \n\nhttps://www.labtestingapi.com/product/culture-sputumlower-respiratory\n\nSomeone else on here did a Candida/IBS panel by Vibrant Labs that showed that they had candida krusei in their system, which is a dangerous strain of candida. \n\nYou can order the test here: \n\nhttps://functionalmedicineshop.com/shop-category/functional-medicine-tests/?add-to-cart=17704\n\nSome people also have what is called the MFTHR gene, which makes them more suspecitible to infections like candida. \n\nYou can get the test here:\n\nhttps://empowerdxlab.com/products/product/mthfr-gene-test?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAwbitBhDIARIsABfFYIKm8l9wLjsl22oQRgT71O_7nGY5FmAF30rTUjOcF0KvgawJBqiKzv8aAm_AEALw_wcB\n\nAlso, some individuals with mold toxicity end up developing MACrON'S, which is a infection of the sinuses and/or lungs by a very, very antibiotic-resistant strain of staph bacteria. You can look into the test here:\n\nhttps://www.microbiologydx.com/order-collection-kits",

It’s been so beneficial for me to get away for awhile and it’s Emma for good reason until I can get the mold under control. It’s something I’ll worry about after I get healed.

I have been desperate for the past couple of around 5 years, yes you heard it right, it started with me noticing yellow patches on my tongue when I was 14 years old, and throughout the years I’ve started getting thinner hair, a fungal toe nail, and just being so depressed all the time. So I was convinced  I had candida. But I just can’t seem to find out why, my mother and sister have perfect red tongues, I don’t have a bad diet, I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, the last 2 months I have been on a low to 0 sugar diet, I haven’t been on antibiotics or had used an asthma breather, I’ve tried nystatin but it didn’t work, I’ve tried salt water rinses with baking soda, I’ve tried tongue scrapers, nothing works. And I’m tired of doctors telling me it’s normal and I shouldn’t worry about it, and them not having a single clue of how to treat is cause they know nothing about the subject. I exercise, I try to be healthy, I tried probiotics, I’ve tried probiotics foods, I don’t even know if I should cause one source says to eat probiotics food and the others says not too cause it will feed the bad bacteria again. I haven’t taken bio film busters yet but I don’t even know where to start, what’s the order of anti fungal, biobusters and probiotics. Where do I start? I am lost and desperate and depressed. Your post is very appreciative but it’s too much information for me too comprehend because I just don’t know where to start, and I also don’t have all the time and money to do all the tests you did and try to get to the deep deep bottom of everything. Can you help me? Or someone? Giving me a simple summerize of where to start and in what order. Please help, I’m disgusted by the idea there is a fungal inside of me, a bad bacteria overgrowing the good, I’m disgusted by the fungal nail, I’m disgusted that my hair is thinning, that my tongue is dirty and filled with filth that doesn’t want to go away, giving me a bad taste and a dry mouth and bad breath.

It's really heartwarming you shared all of this and wanted to just help others who are in the same position.\n\nI have had candida + hydrogen sulfide sibo for a while (candida was there for a long time, sulfur sibo caused y multiple rounds of antibiotics). My biggest symptom is a foul odour from my mouth and nose, and it can go the distance, so was very embarrassing. This odour comes out very strongly when it's in contact with dust (which I am allergic to). So i think MCAS cells are linked, I notice when I take antihistamines the smell is weakened. Thinking about doing allergy shots so the smell doesn't happen every time I'm in an airconditioned/carpeted room.\n\nI tried to treat sulfur sibo with rifaximin + flagyl, it helped but did not eradicate it completely. Did strict low fodmap/low sulfur which helped but did not eradicate, and as soon as I started eating normally again, symptoms are back and worse. Have sent off a microbiome  gut health test so I'm keen to find out whats actually going on.\n\nI'm interested to know more about the digestive enzyme comment and how they originate from mold. I notice everytime I take the enzymedica digest premium the smell tends to worsen because I believe the biofilms are being targeted.\n\nAnyways, I don't know why I wrote all this haha but I guess it's just to vent and relate in a way.

I don’t know what it is, but I just vibe with that brand so much (except their sunscreens, which fall a bit short for me personally). I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better! I’m finding that I absolutely love milky toners now.",

I bought a bottle of it cuz I was out of my Ordinary Glycolic Acid that I use on my body and also my Dr Dennis Gross Peel Pads for my face (was waiting for their sale to restock my big box. Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products.

        "body": "Review: After my surprisingly successful I had with the majority of the Skin1004 Madagascar Centella line promptly soothing a massive hives attack I had last week while  on a business trip, I was curious to try more  of their products.\n\nJust as I was leaving the conference venue, I happened to see a TJ/TK Maxx equivalent with a K-beauty display in the window. And there was this product, at a 20%-off introductory price. So I read the INCI, liked it, &  bought it.\n\nIt was a cloudy day with a stiff chill wind in Northern Europe, temperature 8° C/ 46° F. I definitely felt the cold wind on my face! My lips & cheeks took the brunt for sure. \n\nI rushed the 5 blocks to my hotel room & saw how the wind had affected my Jung Saem Mool Essential Nuder cushion foundation. So I took the plunge and gave my face the recommended 2 spritzes.\n\nFirst of all, the mist sprays in a wide soft, cloud, exceedingly fine & weightless. At first I wondered if any had hit my face at all! I didn't feel \"water\" or \"droplets.\"  Nor did I notice  any particular scent. \n\nThis is certainly unlike my other Western mists, such as the Nuxe Rose Mist, which offers medium size, wet  droplets; the Mario Badescu lavender mist, which sprays heavy and very wet, so wet it can run down your face!; and even the lovely Caudalie Grape Water, which has a fine mist, but can definitely be felt on the face.\n\nWell, the Skin1004 mist does in fact feel like walking into a gentle fog, so I get the \"cloudy\" description.\n\nAfter a minute I want to my bag to grab my Sisley Phyto-Rouge Shine (I love this highly moisturizing sheer balm/lipstick/gloss BTW) and as I put it on I notice the feeling of wind-dryness from my walk had vanished. \n\nMy face looked revived somehow, even though I'd been wearing the cushion for about 8 hours. I just suddenly looked a bit plumper & less tired? \n\nSo I've been using it the whole week now, several times a day. When the stuffy hotel room felt hot, the mist  felt somehow pleasantly cooling. When I felt red from the cold wind, I was soothed. I just love it. \n\nAnd even tho it's made for normal, sensitive & combo skin, it felt perfect on my sensitive & dry skin as well. \n\nMy big con so far is the size of the bottle I have.... not purse friendly!",

I was flaring my entire body and all the doctors forced dupixent on me but I refused because my eczema comes and goes but this past year I was at wits end. Worst it’s ever been.  It turned out that I was highly allergic to propylene glycol and neospirin as well as cocamidopropyl betaine. My dermatologist was useless and told me a patch test on my back would not work since it was all flared. My sweet allergist personally put the patches on, cutting the chemicals into jigsaw puzzles and found every bit of “non red” skin. All the products my dermalogist prescribed and recommended all had PG! No wonder I was flaring. The creams and steroids all had PG! My detergent, toothpaste, shampoo all had my allergens. \nTook two months for my body to heal. I now have real skin. I don’t use any creams to treat eczema anymore, just moisturizer. \n\nIf I have do have flare ups - Desonide ointment and tacromilus for face and neck . \n\n\nMy products I use. I hope this will help some of you. \n\nLaundry - seventh generation free and clear \n\nHand soap and face - vanicream facial cleanser \n\nBody soap - Cerave hydrating bar\n\nMoisturizer - Cerave moisturizing cream\n\nToothpaste - Tom of maines fluoride \n\nShampoo- desert essence tea tree (minimal sebderm.

    "body": "Hello. I think it is important to understand the relationship between histamine intolerance and methylation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHistamine is metabolized (broken down) in two ways. 1) HNMT 2) DAO. The HNMT enzyme is what makes histamine dependent on methylation because it uses s-adenosyl methionine (Sam-e) as its cofactor. Sam-e is the main methyl donor in the body. HNMT enzyme adds methyl group to histamine using Sam-e. If there is too much histamine in the body, too much Sam-e will be used and the methyl groups will be depleted. Also, because the increased histamine in the body leads to things like inflammation, oxidative stress, it indirectly wastes methyl groups. Once histamine enters the brain, the only way to metabolize it is by methylating it with the HNMT enzyme. DAO does not function in the brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reduction of methyl groups is disastrous. Histamine level will increase as the methyl groups decrease. If only it were limited to this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMethylation functions in very important functions for the body such as DNA and RNA synthesis, phosphatidylcholine synthesis, creatine production, gene regulation, energy production, myelin production, immune cell production, neurotransmitter production, and serotonin conversion to melatonin. If methylation is slowed down, these functions will be impaired. Let's find out how we can improve methylation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, search for \"methylation cycle\" on Google Images to better understand what I am saying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) It takes \"methionine\" to produce Sam-e. If you have enough methionine and magnesium in your body (90% of the world is magnesium deficient), you can convert methionine to sam-e.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Homocysteine ​​is required to produce methionine. If you have enough homocysteine, methylfolate, methylcobalamin and zinc in your body, you can convert homocysteine ​​to methionine. If you don't have enough methylfolate, methylcobalamin and zinc in your body, homocysteine ​​can be converted to methionine through betaine (trimethylglycine). However, this should not continue for a long time because betaine is produced from choline. Choline has the methyl group. It oxidizes and turns into betaine. If it continues for a long time, the choline will be depleted. Choline is transformed into phosphatidylcholine to participate in the structure of bile (if phosphatidylcholine is decreased, bile becomes sludge and this can lead to SIBO) and acetylcholine is involved in concentration and learning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) After Sam-e is used, it will be converted back into homocysteine. Thus, the methylation wheel continues to spin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) In summary, homocysteine ​​is methylated through methylfolate, methylcobalamin or betaine (choline) and turns into sam-e. Sam-e, on the other hand, turns into homocysteine ​​by giving methyl group to chemical reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) Cobalamin, methylfolate or Sam-e are needed to produce methylcobalamin. Cobalamin is methylated to methylcobalamin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6) Folate and R5P (the active form of vitamin B2) are needed to produce methylfolate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7) In summary, the only production site of methyl groups in the body is the enzyme called MTHFR. This enzyme gives folate the methyl group thanks to R5P and converts it into methylfolate. Methylfolate gives methyl to cobalamine and homocysteine. In this way, Sam-e and methylcobalamin are formed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8) 70% of the methyl groups in the body are spent converting phosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine (PEMT). I also wrote above. An easier way to create phosphatidylcholine is choline. Choline can convert into phosphatidylcholine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9) Most of the remaining methyl groups in the body are spent on creatine production.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10) Creatine, choline, and phosphatidylcholine may be decreased in someone with histamine intolerance. Supplementing these substances will both eliminate the deficiency and support methylation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n11) You cannot supplement these substances until the end of your life(  If your mthfr gene isn't running too slow.). At some point, you should consume them daily in your diet and keep your methylation working healthy by keeping adequate levels of B vitamins, zinc, and magnesium in your blood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12) Heavy metals, inflammation, unhealthy gut, oxidative stress, stress, and anything we know to be unhealthy for our body deplete our methyl groups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n13) Methylcobalamin and methylfolate supplementation can make things worse if there is inflammation or oxidative stress in the body. So initially, it is better to supplement the missing b12 with hydroxycobalamin instead of methylcobalamin and the missing folate by eating lots of fresh green leafy vegetables. R5P supplementation can make things worse as it produces methylfolate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n14)If you accelerate methylation with active B vitamins but you cannot completely remove histamine from your body, this can result in bad results.  Histamine acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain and high histamine disrupts the neurotransmitter balance in the brain.  Supplementing with B vitamins will also change the neurotransmitter balance.  If these two happen together, your brain may be overstimulated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n15) In summary, the simplest way to support methylation is to take supplements of creatine, choline, and phosphatidylcholine. After supplementing, your histamine intolerance may decrease or perhaps disappear altogether.",

After Sam-e donates a methyl group, it does not directly become homocysteine but rather s-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Elevated levels of adenosine will reduce the rate of the SAH->homocysteine reaction in a non-receptor-mediated way (e.g. not blocked by caffeine), leading to a build-up of SAH itself, which will in turn reduce the rate of SAMe usage, regardless of homocysteine levels or clearance rates. \n\nA speculative leap from this is the possibility that Caffeine may be a culprit in some people's methylation issues, as it opens the door for people to generally function with higher systemic adenosine levels.",

Question is I am intolerant to any form of B12 or folate, folic acid I've tried them all. When I take them I can tell in 24 hours my histamine is going off the chart and I feel Dreadful like I was hit by a truck -- overall body aches and pains head pressure zero energy. My doctor says as I get the mold out of my system, I will have less histamine in my system and eventually will tolerate the methyl donors.

    "body": "I've seen people use the characteristics of life as a checklist to determine whether the embryo or fetus is alive. They'll say something like, \"The fetus doesn't meet all the requirements for life, such as homeostasis, so it's not alive by definition.\" At first glance, we know this is mistaken because the unborn are capable of dying, and something must be alive at some point in order to die. It’s also based on a misunderstanding of the *characteristics of life*:\n\n>“Instead of trying to find a difference that separates living and nonliving things, scientists sometimes define life by listing what are often called characteristics of life. Lists of characteristics of life may differ from one physiologist to the next, depending on the type of organism being studied and the way in which life functions are grouped and defined.” (Kevin T. Patton, [*Anatomy and Physiology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko2bBgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false), 9th edition, Mosby, 2015, 6.)\n\nGenerally, the characteristics of life [includes processes like](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Biology):\n\n* homeostasis\n\n* cellular organization\n\n* metabolism\n\n* growth\n\n* adaptation\n\n* response to stimuli\n\n* and reproduction.\n\nHowever, individual living things are not expected to display all of the characteristics of life at any given moment. This is mentioned in biology textbooks:\n\n- “Although all of these characteristics are necessary to describe life fully, **not all of them apply to every living thing all the time.** Individual organisms do not evolve nor do they necessarily reproduce or always respond to their surroundings. **However, populations of similar organisms have the capacity to perform these functions.**” (Michael D. Johnson, *Human Biology: Concepts and Current Issues*, 8th edition, Pearson, 2016, 6.)\n\n- “The simple list of shared characteristics above, however, does not describe the incredible complexity and diversity of life. **Some forms of life may not even display all of these characteristics all of the time.** For example, the seed of a desert plant may exist for many years in a dormant state in which it doesn't extract energy from the environment, convert molecules, or reproduce. Yet the seed is alive.” (David M. Hillis, David E. Sadava, Richard W. Hill, and Mary V. Price, [*Principles of Life*](https://books.google.com/books?id=iVsZBgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false), 2nd edition, W. H. Freeman, 2013, 2.)  \n\n- “Although **not all of these processes are occurring in cells throughout the body all of the time**, when any one of the life processes ceases to occur properly, the result is the death of cells and tissues, which may lead to death of the organism.” (Gerard J. Tortora and Bryan H. Derrickson, [*Introduction to the Human Body*](https://books.google.com/books?id=BHpUDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false), 11th edition, Wiley, 2017, 6.)  \n\n- “Although there is no definition of life that suits all people, everyone has an idea of what being alive means. Generally, it is accepted that something is alive if it can grow and reproduce, **at least during some stage of its existence.** Thus, we still regard adults who are no longer growing and those individuals beyond reproductive age as being alive. We also regard sterile individuals, such as mules or worker bees as being alive, even though they lack the ability to reproduce.” (David P. Clark and Nanette J. Pazdernik, [*Molecular Biology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Mhs-P94d1R8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false), 2nd edition, Academic Cell, 2012, 3.)\n\nSo, individual things don't have to display all of the characteristics of life to be considered alive. That’s because the characteristics of life apply to livings things on a more general level, such as the species as a whole. Applying them to individual members of species will disqualify all sorts of things that we consider alive.\n\nWith that being said, I want to be thorough, so I'm still going to explain how the unborn display all the characteristics of life. All the following examples are present even in the early stages of the embryo.\n\n# 1. HOMEOSTASIS\n\n>“Homeostasis is the existence and maintenance of a relatively constant internal environment within the body. To achieve homeostasis, the body must actively regulate conditions that are constantly changing. As our bodies undergo their everyday processes, we are continuously exposed to new conditions. These conditions are called variables because their values can change. For example, a small amount of fluid surrounds each body cell; for cells to function normally, the volume, temperature, and chemical content of this fluid must be maintained within a narrow range.” (Cinnamon VanPutte, [*Seeley’s Anatomy and Physiology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=-CPnCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false), 11th edition, McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2016, 9.)\n\nEven individual cells maintain homeostasis:\n\n>“Single cells and unicellular organisms are surrounded by a membrane that allows the cell (or organism) to maintain internal homeostasis by providing a selective barrier to the entry and exit of various substances.” (Michael D. Johnson, *Human Biology: Concepts and Current Issues*, 8th edition, Pearson, 2016, 5.)  \n>  \n>“Homeostasis also occurs at the level of the single cell. Thus, cells regulate many of the same parameters that the body as a whole regulates: volume, the concentrations of small inorganic ions (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, H+), and energy levels (e.g., ATP).” (Walter F. Boron and Emile L. Boulpaep, [*Medical Physiology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=6QzhCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false), 3rd edition, Elsevier Health Sciences, 2016, 4.)\n\nOne of the most well-known examples of homeostasis is when we regulate our body temperature. However, not all living things need to regulate their body temperature (to the extent that you and me do) because the temperature of their surrounding environment is already optimal for survival. Aside from temperature, here’s a list of some other variables that can be regulated to maintain homeostasis:\n\n>“**Concentration of nutrients.** Cells need a constant supply of nutrient molecules for energy production. Energy, in turn, is needed to support life-sustaining and specialized cell activities.  \n>  \n>**Concentration of O2 and CO2.** Cells need O2 to carry out energy-yielding chemical reactions. The CO2 produced during these reactions must be removed so that acid-forming CO2 does not increase the acidity of the internal environment.  \n>  \n>**Concentration of waste products.** The end products of some chemical reactions have a toxic effect on body cells if these wastes are allowed to accumulate.  \n>  \n>**pH.** Changes in pH (relative amount of acid) of the ECF \\[extracellular fluid\\] adversely affect nerve cell function and wreak havoc with the enzyme activity of all cells.  \n>  \n>**Concentrations of water, salt, and other electrolytes.** Because the relative concentrations of salt (NaCl) and water in the ECF influence how much water enters or leaves the cells, these concentrations are carefully regulated to maintain the proper volume of cells. Cells do not function normally when they are swollen or shrunken. Other electrolytes (chemicals that form ions in solution and conduct electricity) perform a variety of vital functions. For example, the rhythmic beating of the heart depends on a relatively constant concentration of potassium (K+) in the ECF.  \n>  \n>**Volume and pressure.** The circulating component of the internal environment, the plasma, must be maintained at adequate volume and blood pressure to ensure bodywide distribution of this important link between the external environment and the cells.  \n>  \n>**Temperature.** Body cells function best within a narrow temperature range. If cells are too cold, their functions slow down too much; if they get too hot, their structural and enzymatic proteins are impaired or destroyed.”  \n>  \n>(Lauralee Sherwood, [*Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems*](https://books.google.com/books?id=_i5BBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PT44#v=onepage&q&f=false), 9th edition, Cengage Learning, 2015, 12.)\n\nThe embryo maintains homeostasis by regulating its cell volume, various ions, and other substances:\n\n>“Very early embryos are particularly sensitive to perturbations that cause decreased volume. To counter this, they have evolved unique mechanisms of cell volume **homeostasis.** The major such mechanism before compaction depends on accumulation of glycine as an organic osmolyte via the GLYT1 transporter. An additional system, which depends on betaine or proline transport, may also operate in parallel with the glycine-dependent mechanism for a short period after fertilization.” ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19825850/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19825850/))  \n>  \n>“The essential metals copper, zinc, and iron play key roles in embryonic, fetal, and postnatal development in higher eukaryotes. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecules involved in the intricate control of the homeostasis of these metals and the availability of natural mutations and targeted mutations in many of the genes involved have allowed for elucidation of the diverse roles of these metals during development. Evidence suggests that the ability of the embryo to control the **homeostasis** of these metals becomes essential at the blastocyst stage and during early morphogenesis. However, these metals play unique roles throughout development and exert pleiotropic, metal-specific, and often cell-specific effects on morphogenesis, growth, and differentiation.” ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18395838/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18395838/))  \n>  \n>“Regulation of ionic **homeostasis** by mammalian embryos” ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11256169/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11256169/))\n\n# 2. CELLULAR ORGANIZATION\n\nLiving things are made up of cells, and cells are the smallest things that are considered alive:\n\n>“Organization refers to the specific interrelationships among the parts of an organism and how those parts interact to perform specific functions. Living things are highly organized. All organisms are composed of one or more cells. Some cells in turn are composed of highly specialized organelles, which depend on the precise organization of large molecules. Disruption of this organized state can result in loss of functions, or even death.” (Cinnamon VanPutte, [*Seeley’s Anatomy and Physiology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=-CPnCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false), 11th edition, McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2016, 6.)\n\nEmbryos are made up of cells.\n\n# 3. METABOLISM\n\n>“Metabolism encompasses all the chemical reactions in the body's cells, necessary to sustain life. These chemical processes allow the body to grow, reproduce, maintain structure, and respond to changes in its environment. These processes can be anabolic, in which energy is used in the formation of substances such as proteins or nucleic acids, or catabolic, in which organic substances are broken down during cellular respiration to harvest energy to support cellular processes such as biosynthesis, transport of molecules or ions across cell membranes, or locomotion.” (Walter F. Boron and Emile L. Boulpaep, [*Medical Physiology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=6QzhCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1170#v=onepage&q&f=false), 3rd edition, Elsevier Health Sciences, 2016, 1170.)\n\nEmbryos have a metabolism:\n\n>“Before compaction, the embryo has a **metabolism** based on low levels of oxidation of pyruvate, lactate, and specific amino acids. . . . After compaction, the embryo exhibits greatly increased oxygen consumption and an increased capacity to use glucose as an energy source. The increase in oxygen consumption possibly reflects the considerable energy required for the formation and maintenance of the blastocele, and the increase in glucose utilization reflects an increased demand for biosynthetic precursors.” ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23312219/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23312219/))\n\n# 4. GROWTH\n\nBiological growth involves cells:\n\n>“Growth is an increase in body size. It may be due to an increase in (1) the size of existing cells, (2) the number of cells, or (3) the amount of material surrounding cells.” (Gerard J. Tortora and Bryan H. Derrickson, [*Introduction to the Human Body*](https://books.google.com/books?id=BHpUDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false), 11th edition, Wiley, 2017, 6.)\n\nEmbryos grow by cell division.\n\n# 5. ADAPTATION\n\nBiology is composed of various fields of study, and some of them use terms differently. For example, \"adaptation\" has different meanings in evolutionary biology and physiology.\n\nIn evolutionary biology, adaptation is used in two ways:\n\n1. “Adaptation (as a process). Evolution of a population by natural selection in which hereditary variants most favorable to organismal survival and reproduction are accumulated and less advantageous forms discarded; includes character adaptation and expiation.” (David A. Baum, Douglas J. Futuyma, Hopi E. Hoekstra, et al., [*The Princeton Guide to Evolution*](https://books.google.com/books?id=_XitAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false), 1st edition, Princeton University Press, 2013, 89.)\n2. “Adaptation (as a [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_evolution)) An organismal trait that evolved gradually by natural selection for a biological role retained by its possessors, and superior to contrasting traits present in the evolutionary history of the population.” (Richard M. Kliman, [*Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Biology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=_r4OCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false), 1st edition, Academic Press, 2016, 1.)\n\nAdaptation (in the first sense) is an evolutionary process that applies to populations and examines changes made over generations, not within individual lifetimes. So we can’t apply it to an individual embryo.\n\nAn adaptation (in the second sense) is a trait that was inherited by natural selection and has a biological role. For example, gills are an adaptation for breathing underwater. Another example of an adaptation is the embryo's mechanisms for obtaining nutrients:\n\n>“The mammalian embryo obtains nutrients directly from its mother and does not rely on stored yolk. This **adaptation** has entailed a dramatic restructuring of the maternal anatomy (such as expansion of the oviduct to form the uterus) as well as the development of a fetal organ capable of absorbing maternal nutrients. This fetal organ—the chorion—is derived primarily from embryonic trophoblast cells, supplemented with mesodermal cells derived from the inner cell mass. The chorion forms the fetal portion of the placenta. It will induce the uterine cells to form the maternal portion of the placenta, the decidua. The decidua becomes rich in the blood vessels that will provide oxygen and nutrients to the embryo.” ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10052/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10052/))\n\nWe just discussed adaptation in the context of evolutionary biology. However, in physiology, the term adaptation is used more generically to discuss the adjustments that individual organisms make to changes in their environments:\n\n>“The adaptability of an organism depends on its ability to alter its response. Indeed, flexible feedback loops are at the root of many forms of physiological adaptation. For instance, at sea level, experimentally lowering the level of oxygen (the sensory stimulus) in the inspired air causes an increase in breathing (the response). However, after acclimatization at high altitude to low oxygen levels, the same low level of oxygen (the same sensory stimulus) causes one to breath much faster (a greater response). Thus, the response may depend on the previous history and therefore the ‘state’ of the system” (Walter F. Boron and Emile L. Boulpaep, [*Medical Physiology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=6QzhCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false), 3rd edition, Elsevier Health Sciences, 2016, 4.)\n\nThe proper term for physiological adaptation is [acclimatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization):\n\n>“The adaptation of physiological processes to a given set of environmental conditions is known as acclimatization when it occurs naturally. If the process takes place artificially in a laboratory setting, it is called acclimation.” (Dee Unglaub Silverthorn, *Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach*, 7th edition, Pearson, 2015, 18.)\n\nEmbryos can acclimatize/acclimate to changing environmental conditions:\n\n>“. . . in vivo or in vitro gametes and embryos face and must **adjust** to multiple microenvironments especially at preimplantation stages. Moreover, the embryo has to be able to further **adapt** to environmental cues in utero to result in the birth of live and healthy offspring. Enormous strides have been made in understanding and meeting stage-specific requirements of preimplantation embryos \\[during IVF\\], but interpretation of the data is made difficult due to the complexity of the wide array of culture systems and the remarkable plasticity of developing embryos **that seem able to develop under a variety of conditions.**” ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24682781/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24682781/))\n\n# 6. RESPONSE TO STIMULI\n\n>“All forms of life respond to stimuli, physical or chemical changes in their internal or external environment. Stimuli that evoke a response in most organisms are changes in the color, intensity, or direction of light; changes in temperature, pressure, or sound; and changes in the chemical composition of the surrounding soil, air, or water. Responding to stimuli involves movement, although not always locomotion (moving from one place to another).” (Eldra Solomon, Charles Martin, Diana W. Martin, and Linda R. Berg, [*Biology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0rAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PT38#v=onepage&q&f=false), 10th edition, Cengage Learning, 2014, 4.)\n\nThe response to a stimulus can take many forms. We usually think of obvious examples, like a shark moving toward the smell of blood. But even bacteria can respond to stimuli, albeit in more subtle ways:\n\n>“When exposed to osmotic stress from the environment, bacteria act to maintain cell turgor and hydration by responding both on the level of gene transcription and protein activity.” ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20607761/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20607761/))\n\nOne example of the embryo responding to stimuli occurs during implantation, when it interacts with the mother through a series of chemical signals:\n\n>“The success of embryo implantation depends on the temporal and spatial synchronization of adequate cross-talk between the embryo and the uterine epithelium. In humans and other mammals, abundant cytokines and growth factors are involved in a complex sequence of signaling events during implantation. These signals converge around the actions of factors such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). These interactions lead to decidualization, receptive endometrial changes, successful embryo implantation and blastocyst differentiation.” ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26800213/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26800213/))\n\n# 7. REPRODUCTION\n\n>“Reproduction is the formation of new cells or new organisms. Without reproduction of cells, growth and development are not possible. Without reproduction of organisms, species become extinct.” (Cinnamon VanPutte, [*Seeley’s Anatomy and Physiology*](https://books.google.com/books?id=-CPnCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false), 11th edition, McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2016, 9.)\n\nLiving things don’t have to be able to reproduce at all times to be considered alive. Many organisms can’t reproduce until they reach a certain level of maturity, and some can’t reproduce at all due to being sterile.

    "body": "(Cross-posted from r/FODMAPS)\n\nI've been symptom-free for a year, so it's time to tentatively post a success story.\n\nWhen I contracted SIBO, I was forced to radically improve my lifestyle. The process took four years, but now I can happily eat the occasional high-FODMAP meal with no negative consequences. I still have erratic gut motility and need to live a healthy life, but I'm free of the misery, malnutrition, constipation and inflammation.\n\nThere wasn't a single magic bullet for me, although a few supplements really helped. These were the steps I took to fix my SIBO:\n\n1. I found an elimination diet (keto) that allowed me to be temporarily symptom-free. The low-FODMAP diet actually didn't help me: I suspect that it worsened my dysbiosis due to the lack of healthy fibers. Getting symptom-free was the only way to start isolating root causes.\n2. I worked on my overall nutrition using Cronometer. I tracked my macros and micros for a month, then started beefing up my nutrition until I was in the green for protein, healthy fat, and nutrients. This required...\n3. ...A big lifestyle shift. Drastically cutting back on alcohol, getting tons more sleep, exercising daily, and cutting my sugar intake to near-zero. This was hard for a while, and now it's easy. I feel like an athlete most days, and a few years ago I just wanted to die.\n4. Reintroducing non-keto foods and monitoring the results. At this point, I finally started figuring out my underlying cause: I had low stomach acid, which allowed bacteria to collect in my stomach and enter my small intestine, causing bloating, inflammation, and mixed diarrhea and constipation.\n5. On the suggestion of TC Hale (a great YouTube resouce for IBS), I did a three-week course of D-Limonene first thing in the morning. This cleared out my stomach.\n6. I then started improving my digestion using supplements. I added Betaine HCL capsules to each meal in order to increase my stomach acid, plus a broad-spectrum digestive enzyme. I still do this, as well as ox bile last thing at night and TUDCA to improve my bile flow.\n7. Finally, and very importantly, I began to reintroduce small but diverse sources of fiber into my diet. Not enough to clog up my recovering intestines, but enough to provide food for diverse beneficial bacteria.\n\nI'm feeling great now. My mental health is night-and-day. If I have a week of garbage eating then I'll notice the old problems creeping back, but they go away as soon as I switch back to a healthy diet. For reference, I have an egg bowl in the morning, a nutritious smoothie for lunch, and a hearty dinner with lots of vegetables. I also eat one or two indulgent meals per week, and I've never felt better.",

The intrusive thoughts are horrible and not to mention the brain fog that keeps me confused. I used to drink wine everyday and I think that was the root cause. I quit almost 3 months ago and have gotten better but the constant bloating looking 9 months pregnant has not gone away, maybe I look 7 months now but still there. My mental health symptoms have improved but I still feel that I’m not ok, I constantly crave sweets that I didn’t before (before I quit drinking) and that is holding me back. Keto works for me but it’s been a struggle to keep up without sugar. I’ll definitely give your steps a try and hope to get out of this mental agony I’ve been.

Pylori much sooner and allowed targeted treatment - and most of all, as it is as this stage, Pylori will still be in there draining resources and requiring this routine to manage it - and all it can take is one more health episode - a virus, grief, etc, for the thing to become dominant again.  \n\nAgain I am not 100% online diagnositng H. Pylori.  \nIt does strongly fit this picture - but more important is the total apparent lack of data driven testing to confirm any of this.

    "body": "Edits: Tried to fix some formatting issues. \n\n—\n\nHi everyone! \n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/?st=JIATDG0T&sh=d905c745), I talked at length about the skin condition of rosacea -- what it is, the subtypes, what the causes are, the foundations in treatment (cleansing and moisturizing), as well as treatments and beneficial ingredients. This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "**FROM DEATH’S DOOR TO HEALING: My Secret Weapon and Advice One Year Later**\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFirst off, many of you have already read this so I am going to include some updates real quick before the main article.\n\nIt's winter now and I think it's fair to say that for many of us, we spiral out of control in the winter. I believe this is mainly due to the darkness and here in the states, Daylight Savings Time messing with our circadian rhythms.\n\nMy advice on this one is DO NOT STAY UP LATE, wake up earlier, and buy a happy light. I always went to bed at like 3 or 4 am and woke up late and come Daylight Savings Time, it was always a disaster. But I started going to bed by midnight, waking up at 9, and when I wake up, I go sit in the window where the sunlight is with a happy light 10 inches from my face for about an hour. And if the sun is out, I take off my shirt and get direct sunlight. This changed everything for me. Also, get the free app called f.lux to control the blue light on your screens. It gradually removes blue light the later it gets and this helps control this issue of circadian rhythm.\n\nThe other issue I discovered lately had to do with the pomegranate juice and the berries I suggested. I have to monitor the pom juice, but ESPECIALLY the berries. I still have some every day, but in more moderation. I found that eating too many blueberries in particular has been taking me out. No more than a small handful a day in the salad.\n\nAlso, the coconut milk. You can't let it stay in your fridge for more than a few days or it will grow histamine.\n\nAnyway, here's the main article:\n\nSix months ago, I was on the brink of taking my own life because of this disease. My skin burned and itched and tickled like fire ants were crawling all over me, biting me constantly. I thought I would never sleep again, and I feared I was losing my mind. Nothing I tried was working. But now, I'm stable. I'm healing. And I’m ready to share what I’ve learned to help others who are suffering from this horrendous condition.\n\nAfter battling MCAD for a year, here are a few key takeaways. First, most doctors, even specialists, know shockingly little about the root cause of this disease. Far too many of them are DANGEROUSLY IGNORANT and also ARROGANT when it comes to this topic. In my case, and I stress IN MY CASE, it all came down to leaky gut—a breakdown in the intestinal lining that lets food particles pass into the bloodstream, where the immune system attacks them. You might have something else, like SIBO. But for leaky gut, to heal, you need to understand histamine, histamine liberators, oxalates, sugars, gluten, casein, and lectins. But, if you cut out all those foods, plus do Low FODMAP and low salicylate, you’re left with basically nothing except water and that's a death sentence. The stress of trying to navigate the endless contradictions on the internet was only making the disease worse. I was lost.\n\nBut then I realized something. I realized that, overall, the greatest tool to navigate it all, better than doctors, better than websites or reddit, was ChatGPT. I started using it to track every food, supplement, and medication I was on, and it gave me way better advice than any other source. I asked it to categorize foods by histamine levels, gut health impact, and other factors, and the results were eye-opening.\n\nFor example, I was reacting to apples and told ChatGPT. ChatGPT suggested peeling them. Removing the skin completely. That worked. Now I can eat apples. It’s not perfect, but it’s light years ahead of the brambles of contradictions out there. You just have to be thorough—explain everything and challenge any advice that seems off. Ask it to make sorted lists of things by most to least beneficial or dangerous under those parameters I mentioned earlier. \n\nJust say to ChatGPT “I have leaky gut and histamine intolerance or MCAD. Here are the foods and supplements and drugs I am on. Tell me about each one when it comes to histamine, histamine liberation, oxalates, lectins, gut inflammation, sugar, casein, and gluten. Make me a list of best to worst. Is this good or is this bad? What should I remove, what should I add? How much of this should I be taking? When should I take it?” and so forth. Tell it everything and ask a lot of questions. It’s way better than the websites. \n\n**Here's an example:**\n\nMe: \"ChatGPT. I have leaky gut and MCAD. In terms of histamine, histamine liberation, lectins, oxalates, casein, sugar, and overall gut inflammation, which is worse for me you think? Tortilla chips made with yellow corn, canola oil, and salt, or shredded mozzarella cheese in a bag?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Between shredded mozzarella cheese and tortilla chips made with yellow corn, here’s a comparative analysis based on your conditions (leaky gut and MCAD):\n\n# Shredded Mozzarella Cheese\n\n* **Histamine**: Cheese, especially aged varieties, can be high in histamine. Even shredded mozzarella can contain moderate levels due to the dairy fermentation process.\n* **Histamine Liberators**: Dairy is a known liberator of histamine, which may provoke symptoms in sensitive individuals.\n* **Lectins**: Cheese does not contain lectins.\n* **Oxalates**: Dairy products are low in oxalates, but some cheeses may have moderate levels.\n* **Casein**: Contains casein, which can be inflammatory for those with dairy sensitivities.\n* **Sugar**: Generally low in sugar.\n* **Gut Inflammation**: Dairy can contribute to gut inflammation in sensitive individuals, especially in those with leaky gut.\n\n# Tortilla Chips (Yellow Corn)\n\n* **Histamine**: Generally low in histamine.\n* **Histamine Liberators**: Corn is not known to be a liberator.\n* **Lectins**: Contains lectins, which can be problematic for some people, particularly with leaky gut.\n* **Oxalates**: Low in oxalates.\n* **Casein**: Does not contain casein.\n* **Sugar**: Generally low in sugar.\n* **Gut Inflammation**: Corn may cause gut inflammation in some individuals, especially those sensitive to it.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**For your specific conditions:**\n\n* **Cheese** is likely worse for you due to its histamine content, potential to liberate histamine, presence of casein, and inflammatory potential for those with leaky gut.\n* **Tortilla chips** are lower in histamine and do not contain casein, making them a better option, although they may still cause issues due to lectins.\n\nIf you’re managing histamine sensitivity, it would generally be safer to limit or avoid cheese in favor of the tortilla chips, while being mindful of how your body reacts to both. As always, individual responses can vary, so monitoring your symptoms after consumption can provide further clarity.\"\n\n***BTW, if you're really suffering, don't eat EITHER of these!***\n\n**Here's another one for ChatGPT:**\n\nMe: \"I have histamine intolerance/MCAD and leaky gut. I am taking these medications: Zyrtec, montelukast, famotidine, diclofenac. I am trying to figure out if any of these are hurting my gut. Please make a list from most harmful to least and tell me why.\"\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\"Here’s a list of the medications you're taking, from most to least likely to harm your gut, along with explanations:\n\n# 1. Diclofenac (NSAID)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: High\n* **Reason**: Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause irritation to the stomach lining, increase the risk of ulcers, and exacerbate leaky gut. Long-term use of NSAIDs is known to damage the gut barrier and impair healing, which can worsen leaky gut over time.\n\n# 2. Montelukast (Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Moderate\n* **Reason**: Montelukast is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause gastrointestinal side effects like stomach pain, indigestion, or nausea. While it's not known to directly harm the gut lining, its effects on the gastrointestinal system might still aggravate symptoms for those with sensitive digestion or leaky gut.\n\n# 3. Famotidine (H2 Blocker)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Low to Moderate\n* **Reason**: Famotidine reduces stomach acid, which can relieve symptoms like acid reflux but may disrupt the natural balance of gut flora over time. Reduced acid levels might also make it harder to digest food properly, which can negatively impact gut health. However, it’s generally safer for the gut compared to NSAIDs.\n\n# 4. Zyrtec (Cetirizine, Antihistamine)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Low\n* **Reason**: Zyrtec is an antihistamine that’s considered to have minimal impact on gut health. While it can cause mild gastrointestinal side effects (such as nausea or dry mouth), it's not known to cause significant damage to the gut lining.\n\n# Summary:\n\n* **Diclofenac** is the most harmful for your gut due to its potential to irritate the stomach lining and worsen leaky gut.\n* **Montelukast** could cause gastrointestinal issues but is less harmful.\n* **Famotidine** might alter gut flora, though its impact is moderate.\n* **Zyrtec** is the least harmful, with minimal effects on the gut.\n\nIf you're concerned about how these medications affect your gut, it might be worth discussing alternatives with your doctor, especially for diclofenac.\"\n\nI stopped taking Diclofenac because of this and that's a big part of how I began healing.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you shouldn't look at any websites ever, or Reddit, or go to a doctor, but just know that if you do that, you will likely enter a very confusing maze of truth mixed with contradictions, ignorance, and overwhelming information. You can learn a lot that way, but you can also just become instantly lost. Try incorporating ChatGPT to help out.\n\nThe secret to using ChatGPT correctly is to KEEP IT FOCUSED. If you ask \"Make me a low histamine recipe,\" it will possibly make mistakes like telling you to use lemon juice, avocado, or banana. But if you say \"Analyze these specific foods in terms of histamine, histamine liberation, lectins, oxalates, and gut inflammation,\" it generally becomes INCREDIBLY accurate and useful.\n\n# My Healing Process\n\nI was given antibiotics that destroyed my gut biome, and I took diclofenac, which put literal holes in my intestines. I didn’t realize these things were part of the problem. ChatGPT helped me figure that out, and from there, I could work on rebuilding.\n\nI will state that I don't do low salicylate or low FODMAP along with my diets. If I did, like I said, there would only be water left. If you are doing those, tell ChatGPT.\n\nNow, here’s what worked for me, and while everyone’s different, maybe this will help you, too.\n\n# Drugs\n\nWhat I take before bed:\n\n* Zyrtec (Aller-Tec from Amazon or Costco, 365 pills for 20 bucks) (4)\n* Famotidine (2)\n* Montelukast (1) (this one you do need a prescription for)\n* Quercetin with Bromelain (I'm so unsure about this one; if it is good or bad or does nothing at all)\n* Viagra (Sildenafil) No seriously, this one opens the blood vessels and prevents histamine from pooling in certain parts of the body like my hands and head and causing them to burn and itch. When I was at my worst, the pooling was my number one problem. If you have this problem, go to your doctor and ask for sildenafil, the generic for Viagra, which unlike Viagra, is incredibly inexpensive.\n\nI was on Xolair, but it didn’t help me. If it works for you, great, but don’t believe doctors who say Xolair is the “end of the line.” It’s about healing the gut, and doctors just don’t seem to get that in the slightest. I went to three specialists, and all they offered were antihistamines and “avoid tomatoes.” When I asked them about the connection between my gut and the reactions, they looked at me like I was talking about the Loch Ness Monster coming out of my bathtub.\n\n# Supplements\n\nHere's the deal on supplements. **Don't use multivitamins.** Do one thing at a time. And read the ingredients before you buy them. Most vitamin C for example is hard on the gut and is high in histamine and a histamine liberator. And even if you find one that isn't, they will often have extra ingredients like \"citrus bioflavonoids\" or rose hips or sunflower oil or something. Those are also histamine liberators. You have to work to eliminate any little thing that might cause a reaction.\n\nHere’s what worked for me. Remember, introduce supplements ***ONE AT A TIME***\\*\\*.\\*\\* And take them 10-15 minutes before the meal (except for the probiotic, take after as it could be broken down by the betaine HCl). Also, don't buy all of these all at once. Buy the first phase and then work on that for a few weeks and then move on to the next phase.\n\n1. **NatraDAO DAO** (blue box)\n2. **Pure Encapsulations Digestive Enzymes Ultra with Betaine HCl** (if your gut is really hurting, it might be best to start with the one without Betaine HCl and then move up like a month later. I think this supplement is extremely important.)\n3. **Allergy Research Group Magnesium Ascorbate (plain version)** (a safe form of **vitamin C** without histamine-liberating ingredients like rose hip or citrus bioflavonoids)\n4. **Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Glycinate**\n5. **Pure Encapsulations Calcium Citrate** (to break down oxalates. Take this one with anything higher oxalate like the sweet potato chips I'll mention in a moment.)\n\nThese next two could take time to add, but they’re crucial:\n\n* **Zinc L-Carnosine**\n* **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**, **B2 (Riboflavin)**, and **Copper**\n\nFor this next phase, take your time, and monitor your body's reaction to determine if these are worth it for you right now:\n\n* **PE L-Glutamine (switch to powder form after you build up, something like Naked brand)** (slowly build up from say .5 to 5–10 g daily, taking some on an empty stomach. Although be careful. When I got to 10 grams I started negatively reacting to it and went back to 5 where I still currently am. Everyone is going to be different with this. Ideally you should apparently be taking even higher doses like 20 or 30 or 40 grams, but many of us might not be able to handle that. I kind of use it for a few weeks and then don't for a few. My safe spot is now between 0 and 5 grams.)\n* **Seeking Health ProBiota HistaminX** (Build up to two but I wouldn't go beyond that for a while if you are really struggling overall. I'm still trying to figure this one out. Sometimes I take it, sometimes I don't.)\n\n# Food and Drink\n\nAs far as this stuff goes, if you are REALLY struggling, like you think you might go insane or die, do a reset, **TAKE AWAY ALL YOUR FOOD** and start here.\n\n* **Water** is your best friend. I prefer sparkling water, and no, the carbon dioxide won’t hurt your gut. Stomach acid converts it back to gas and it leaves via your esophagus. I have a SodaStream. I don't use flavorings.\n* **Coconut milk** (hopefully you can find one WITHOUT additives like B12, a possible histamine liberator). I drink Real Coco. **Do NOT let it remain opened in your fridge for more than a few days or it will mess you up!**\n* **Straight Rooibos Tea** (no additional ingredients besides perhaps grated fresh ginger. This tea is a mast cell stabilizer. I drink it with every meal.)\n* **Whatever you do, DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL!**\n* If you are REALLY craving alcohol, like at a party, use **kava from a tincture** in its place.\n* **Don't smoke.** Quit, using nicotine replacement therapy. If you are having cravings, use **nicotine gum** in place of smoking, like at a party or on a trip.\n\nWe'll talk about each of these section as a Phase. Each Phase will likely take several months before adding in the food from the next one.\n\n**PHASE ONE:**\n\nStart simple:\n\n* **White rice** (NON-ENRICHED, the one WITHOUT added vitamins like b12)\n* **Rice noodles** are also a fantastic starch.\n* **Ghee** is amazing for gut health—LOTS of it, especially the refrigerated grass-fed kind. Put it on the rice, the rice noodles, zucchini, veggies, meat, put it on everything.\n* **Zucchini** (But don't let it or any other food cook to the point that it has color or char. At least not for awhile. That makes histamine.\n* **Sea Salt** is a good tool to have. Maybe use the kind WITHOUT iodine, as it may be a histamine liberator for some. Although some people might NEED the iodine.\n\nSlowly add:\n\n* **Asparagus, squash, pumpkin, bok choy, and arugula.**\n* **Gluten-free oatmeal** (Bob's Red Mill)\n* **Fresh herbs** like rosemary, thyme, basil, and tarragon. No marjoram. Double-check each one with ChatGPT.\n\nAnd while leftovers are generally dangerous as they are higher in histamine, leftover cooked veggies seem to take longer for that to happen. You should be okay to eat them for a few days.\n\n**PHASE TWO:**\n\nAdd in gradually:\n\n* **Coconut Oil** (Good, but ghee is probably better. Use sparingly.)\n* **Avocado Oil** works well too.\n* **Fresh-frozen lamb** (I recommend **Wild Fork’s lamb stew meat** from their website) For this one, start with one small chunk, and the next day try two and so forth. I can still only eat like 6 or 7 pieces a day but it's a LOT better than nothing. **MEAT MUST BE FRESH-FROZEN, NEVER THAWED, NOT FROM THE GROCERY STORE. AND NO LEFTOVERS ON MEAT. If it's thawed, it will grow histamine.**\n* **Broccoli, cauliflower, red cabbage, and Brussels sprouts** (These never bothered me, but they do have sulfur so don't overdo it.)\n* **Lesser Evil Brand Paleo Puffs** (straight Himalayan Pink Salt variety made with cassava (THIS ONE IS INCREDIBLE!)\n\nFor salads:\n\n* **Arugula, fresh herbs** (rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, tarragon, etc), olive oil, and a blend of blueberries, blackberries, and pomegranate juice. **(Be very moderate with the berries and pom. Don't eat more than a few berries a day. I made the mistake of starting to eat entire cartons of them and had reactions).** Also, as you cut your vegetables, combine some of each in tupperware and put this mix on your salad. That way, you are also getting some of the uncooked versions with their microbes into your gut. \n* **About pomegranate juice** \\- Pomegranate juice serves as a substitute for vinegar and salad dressing, ESPECIALLY when combined with the berries. Use POM Wonderful. Just make sure it's JUST the straight pomegranate juice version, not a mixture of two juices. You can also make pickles this way. Pomegranate juice with a lot of salt, and a small amount of **fresh** dill *(warning, this may be a liberator so you might want to forego the dill for a while!)* Soak sliced cucumber in it overnight in the fridge. But here's a **WARNING: buy the smallest container of the juice and use it within just a few days. If you get a big one and let it sit for weeks at a time, it will grow histamine. Also, don't overdo the pom juice. And monitor your body for reactions to it.**\n\n**PHASE THREE:**\n\n* **Jackson’s avocado oil (or coconut oil) Sweet Potato Chips (wavy is way better)** (mix with the calcium to handle oxalates). The sweet potato chips are great, but don't overdo them. And yes, even though avocados are an issue, the oil is fine. This stuff is all on Amazon (hopefully.)\n* **Apples (peeled)** (don't eat more than one a day because of sugar content)\n* These snacks will save you from going insane!\n\n**PHASE FOUR:**\n\n* **Fresh frozen chicken** (I buy the Wild Fork cubes from their website) This one I can eat less of than the lamb. Two cubes a day tops for me. Again, **MEAT MUST BE FRESH-FROZEN, NEVER THAWED, NOT FROM THE GROCERY STORE. AND NO LEFTOVERS ON MEAT. If it's thawed, it will grow histamine.**\n* **Brown rice-based gluten free pasta** (Hooray!)\n* **Sweet potatoes** (PEELED. NEVER eat the peel, and combine with calcium to break down oxalates)\n* **Carrot**\n* **Unsweetened, natural, dried coconut chips**\n\n**BAKING:**\n\nAt some point, you should be able to go to the store and buy **GLUTEN FREE BREAD,** the bread that has the least iffy ingredients. Let's see what I'm eating currently.\n\n\"Canyon Bakehouse Gluten Free Country White.\"\n\nIngredients: Water, brown rice flour, tapioca, whole grain sorghum flour, cane sugar, potato starch, whole grain oat flour, expeller pressed canola oil, xanthan gum, and 2 percent or less of egg whites, yeast, sea salt, vinegar.\n\nNow this has some stuff that if you are really struggling might be too much. Eggs and yeast and vinegar. But they are in such small amounts here. I'm tolerating eating two slices quite well currently. I use them to make a **sandwich.** Ghee on toast with rice noodles, lamb and chicken, vegetables like zucchini, arugula, and sesame oil. DELICIOUS!\n\nBut if you CAN'T tolerate this, you'll need to make your own bread.\n\nTo make **BREAD,** you will need these things:\n\n* **Cassava Flour**\n* **White Rice Flour**\n* **Arrowroot Flour**\n* **Sorghum Flour**\n* **Potato Starch**\n\nTell ChatGPT your situation, tell it you have these ingredients and ask for a safe recipe using them.\n\n**PHASE FIVE:**\n\nFor starters, up the **DIGESTIVE ENZYMES WITH BETAINE HCL.** Slowly try to get to where you are taking two with **EVERY MEAL.** Back off if you get nauseous.  \nThen, start trying these things:\n\n* **Egg yolk** (1 to start).\n* **Cinnamon** (seems to be fine)\n* And if you simply must have dessert beyond an apple, try making **rice pudding,** but instead of using regular sugar, always use **monk fruit sweetener with allulose.**\n* And for something with more weight, try **tempura veggies** using rice flour, potato starch, egg yolk and cooked in corn oil. So far, this one hasn't bothered me, but I probably wouldn't do it every day.\n* Small amounts of **garlic, pepper, onion powder.**\n* **Cauliflower Soup**\n* **Pistachios**\n* **Macadamia Nuts**\n* **Turkish Macadamia Butter**\n* **Unsulphured Dried Mangos**\n* **Occasional A2 Milk** (drink a small amount with the sweet potato chips to break down oxalates)\n* **Occasional organic grass-fed butter**.\n* **Rice Chex and regular Cheerios** (These have a small amount of things like molasses that may be triggering so don't overdo it)\n* **Sesame Oil** (Hooray!)\n* **One single corn tortilla** (preferably the rare, refrigerated kind that doesn't have a bunch of other weird ingredients, but any corn one might be okay.) You can use this to put rice, veggies, some sesame oil, arugula, and meat into to make a **taco.** \n* **Start microdosing.** A Pringle. A bite of casserole. Just one per day, and no not one bite of something you know it going to definitely mess you up like tomatoes or spinach. This may or may not be worth it.\n* When you are having a meal with a more advanced thing like dairy or corn or the meat, that's the meal that you should use the most Digestive Enzymes Ultra with Betaine HCl on.\n\nAt this point, you might hit kind of a wall where your histamine bucket overflows. You'll have to really work with ChatGPT and figure out which of the things you recently added is doing it. You might have to slow down or backtrack. It's also why you want to add each one of these gradually, one at a time. Don't have multiple question marks happening at the same time. Just one. Try one, wait several days, then try another. Same thing with supplements. **Do NOT add more than one thing at a time.**\n\nAt this point, I would recommend something that might sound strange.\n\n**Stop taking most of your supplements.** Not the DAO and not the Digestive Enzymes, but everything else. For a week. See how your body likes it. And from then on experiment with taking time off from them. A week, a month, and then back.\n\nIf you have gotten this far, try **vitamin B6 in the form of P-5-P,** although this one might cause reactions. See if you can get one that isn't like \"20 thousand percent daily value,\" but much lower. And for **vitamin b12**, try methylcobalamin.\n\nThis process took me at least six months, but it was worth it. I went from barely eating anything to now having enough variety in my diet that I'm no longer going insane. But the most important thing is that I’m **sleeping through the night again.** The scariest part of this disease is when it starts to look like you'll never be able to sleep again.\n\nDrink **LOTS of water** throughout the day to rid the body of histamine via urination.\n\nEat slowly and chew your food well!\n\nGet lots of sleep. And if you're REALLY struggling, don't exercise much, as it releases histamine. When you start healing, then start adding in exercise.\n\nAnother thing I’d recommend is to ditch any perfumes, colognes, incense and such or at least pay attention to them as they might be liberators. \n\nI CANNOT STRESS THIS NEXT ONE ENOUGH: If you are having serious skin issues like itching, **TAKE A SHOWER RIGHT BEFORE BED!** (not just in the morning, also not too hot) and then put lotion all over yourself immediately when you get out. This helps a lot.\n\nIf your scalp burns and itches, use **Jamaican Mango and Lime No More Itch Gro Spray (mentholated).** Soak it in the stuff and if it's really bad, put a shower cap over that and keep it on in bed. I used to have to sleep that way, but it saved my life. The stuff really helps a lot.\n\nMy hands were really bad too at night. **Cortisone cream** for this one. And try adding **Sarna** to it too. If your scalp is too much for even the spray, put this stuff on your head as well. Maybe everywhere. If all else fails, for itching, use cortisone cream.\n\n# Leaky Gut\n\nAlso, I think one of the most important things I did on my road to healing, and I also can't stress this enough, was watch the documentary **“Hack Your Health: Secrets to Your Gut”** on Netflix. I found that it really helped me understand how this all works, why I developed this disease in the first place, and what to do about it. Understanding more about the gut micro biome is extremely important to healing. Please, for the love of God, watch that one.\n\n# One Last Piece of Advice\n\nIt’s scientifically proven that trauma and stress are literally stored in the body and can manifest as physical diseases, especially autoimmune disorders and gut issues. If you have trauma, it's time to deal with it. Go to therapy. Meditate. Try reiki. Work with a shaman. Listen to solar plexus chakra healing frequencies on YouTube. Study PTSD. Read **The Body Keeps the Score** by Bessel van der Kolk. That one brings it all into crystal clear focus.\n\nI have CPTSD. I wasn’t facing it. I thought if I could just ignore it, I would be okay. But it doesn't work like that. When I reached my lowest point with the histamine disease, it became clear that I had to start healing emotionally in order to heal physically. The moment I began addressing my trauma, my histamine disease started to improve. I think this is a huge part of understanding how to heal from this illness.\n\nTake care of your gut. Address your mental health. Use ChatGPT. And don’t give up.\n\nAlso, if you have any suggestions about how I could personally go further in my own healing or make this better, please let me know.\n\nGood luck to all of you on this journey. You’re not alone.",

But my dermatologist has diagnosed me with chronic urticaria which I have been having it since the pandemic started but very mild and then got COVID in October of last year, and ever since then my symptoms worsened. In retrospect, I know I overdid it eating high histamine foods; in fact most of those foods are considered healthy like avocados, fermented foods, nuts etc; I had never had any issues before; but my doc says that COViD also contributed.

Thank you for sharing it. \nHow much of the Probiota HistaminX do you take? I just started taking it. I will try to get the App. Thanks again",

    "body": "My Long Covid Recovery Story\n\nTL;DR:  got Omicron twice in 6 months, started long hauling and tested positive for 3 tick-borne illnesses. This is my recovery story.  As of today Oct 15 2022, I have no symptoms.\n\nMore details and resources that helped me here: \nhttps://survivinglongcovid.com/my-long-covid-recovery-story/ \n\n\nFirst Infection – Omicron\nIn January 2022, I attended an event in NYC and shortly afterward developed flu-like symptoms. A PCR test at my local CVS came back positive for COVID-19, and I started treating my acute symptoms with the recommended aspirin, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, melatonin and a few other anti-inflammatory supplements. My blood oxygen levels never dropped below 94, and about 18 days later, I considered myself fully recovered.  \n\nAbout a month later, I started to feel ankle stiffness and pain in my left ankle that I had sprained 10 years ago. I though maybe it was from lower body workout intensity, so I went low-impact for my exercise routine. The pain persisted and worsened into May. It got bad enough that I went to a podiatrist who gave me a cortisone injection in my ankle and a 10-day course of meloxicam (pain killer).  I felt there had to be something more to this continuing health issue, so I went to a sports medicine doctor for a second opinion. He sent me for a non-weight bearing X-ray which came back with no issues visible, so recommended physical therapy. I did physical therapy (mostly stretches and theraband exercises) through June with modest results. The pain had now spread up from my ankle to the left side of my shin and I started to feel tingling neuropathy along the outside of my left leg and into my foot. \n\nSecond Infection – Omicron B4/B5 Variant?\nIn early July, after visiting friends (who I discovered later were positive for COVID) I came down with an upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, headache, fever, sore throat… the works.  So, I went into complete bed rest for three days with all the usual supplements + aspirin to treat what I assumed was round two of COVID for me. On the fourth day, I felt better, so I went out to a car show with friends and then out to dinner that evening. The following day, the pain in my left leg suddenly became excruciating and swelling in both feet developed. I also started to have intense brain fog, memory loss, personality changes, suicidal thoughts, and general malaise. I lost all appetite over this week and stopped eating. I experienced extreme anxiety and couldn’t sleep for any reasonable length of time for several days. \n\nAcute Long COVID Symptoms\nAt this point, things took a rapid turn for the worst. I experienced the whole package of Long COVID symptoms that included full body histamine flush, severe edema in both legs, adrenaline dumps, panic attacks, “air hunger” shortness of breath, feeling like I was forgetting to breath, chills, full body tremors, heart palpitations, left side numbness and neuropathy from head to toe, swollen blue visible veins, gastrointestinal pain, liver and gallbladder pain, shortness of breath, visual disturbances and “floaters”, fluctuating body temperature, extreme sensitivity to sound and light, dizziness, vertigo, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), left side weakness when walking, electrical shock feelings in my brain, random “smell memories” (where I’d experience strong nicotine smoke or other strong smells from prior life experiences), severe PTSD from negative childhood experiences, derealization, depersonalization, tooth nerve pain, trigeminal neuralgia, muscle spasms, and other symptoms that I’m probably forgetting at this point (the brain has a way of “blanking out” the worst of life’s negative experiences).\n\nMultiple ER Visits – I Am Dying, Right?\nMost of this severe period of Long COVID was a blur, but I ended up having 5 ER visits in as many days, trying to find answers for these symptoms. Labs and imaging came back fine for the most part. Bilirubin levels were significantly elevated at 2.6 (likely viral hepatitis), but everything else appeared normal. One doctor scratched his head and just told me point blank he had no idea what it was, but would give me a 5-day course of steroids and see if it cleared up.  Another doctor thought I had Lyme disease, so gave me a 14-day course of doxycycline (antibiotic). The steroid gave me extreme psychosis and clinical mania symptoms. My primary doctor gave me a referral to a psychiatrist, but I wasn’t interested in that approach, as I knew the ultimate cause was physiological, not psychological. The antibiotic seemed to have the most rapid positive effect. The night after I started taking it, I woke up during the night drenched in sweat feeling the same way you might after a high fever breaks; exhausted but with significantly improved symptoms. The day after taking the doxycycline, I felt well enough to climb on my bike and ride around the neighborhood. My vision, smell and mental processing had a clarity that I hadn’t experienced in months. Later, my tick-panel came back with positive titer for Anaplasmosis, a severe tick-borne co-infection of Lyme disease. My working theory is I probably had Lyme+co-infections, but my immune system had fought them off until COVID nuked it into total dysfunction which activated this underlying illness.  \n\nLong COVID + Co-infections Recovery Begins\nI felt better for several weeks until mid August when I over-exerted myself attending a family reunion and crashed hard with a flare up of symptoms. At this point, I had seen my primary doctor who found via testing that I was deficient in Vitamin B1, B12, D and several other vitamins and minerals. I was taking supplements recommended by her and a functional medicine doctor I’d seen, as well as some of the recommendations from the CovidLongHaulers subreddit. I had also discovered Tom Bunker’s Facebook group for curing Long Covid via Fasting/Autophagy and had struggled through my first 42 hour water fast, consuming nothing but water and electrolytes. The day after the fast, I felt terrible. However, I felt significantly better over the next few days. It was enough of an improvement that I decided to try it again every two weeks going forward. \n\nI went into ‘try everything’ mode. It was all fair game.  I tried vagus nerve exercises, meditation, breath work, binaural music, “ohm” humming, transcendental meditation, infrared sauna, grounding, red light therapy, cold showers, hot epsom salt baths, massage therapy, foam rolling, an alpha stem device (CES), a low histamine diet, an acupressure mat, sleeping at an incline for silent reflux, cervical neck traction, physical therapy exercises for cervical spine instability (all my joints and neck were cracking and popping and felt extremely weak and loose), extended prayers of thankfulness and requests for healing to God along with Bible reading (mostly the Psalms), a carefully curated supplement stack, a religiously kept bedtime and routine for sleep hygiene, 16/8 intermittent fasting, monitoring my glucose with a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) and more. \n\nSupplements and Drugs I took for Long COVID:\nI’ve linked to the brands/products that worked for me.\n\nLoratadine / Claritin to reduce full body histamine response early in illness\nFamotidine / Pepsid AC to reduce severe neurological and vagus nerve related symptoms early in illness\nMagnesium to help nerve pain and muscle spasms\nBenfothiamine (B1) as I was severely deficient\nB-complex (all the B’s)\nVitamin D + K2\nZinc\nLow-Histamine Probiotics\nNattokinase and Serrapeptase initially, followed by Lumbrokinase as micro-clot busting agents\nD-Ribose (big energy boost early on)\nNAC for NAD+\nBetaine HCI for low stomach acid (my PCP tried to give me PPI’s… I didn’t take them)\nPeppermint pills to calm IBS-C symptoms\nLicorice root to heal GI and antiviral, anti-parasitic, antibacterial properties\nSlippery elm bark powder in smoothies to heal GI\nL-glutamine to heal GI\nMastic gum to heal stomach lining and what felt like ulcers, though H.Pylori test was negative\nQuercetin for autophagy and potential mast cell stabilization (MCAS)\nResveratrol\nIvermectin (for Babesia blood cell parasites, prescription required in the US)\nFish Oil pills for Omega 3’s\nDHEA taken sublingually to fix my hormonal imbalances related to the HPA axis including adrenal insufficiency\nCBD for sleep and anxiety reduction\nAdaptogenic Mushrooms (no, not psilocybin): lion’s mane, cordyceps militaris, reishi, chaga, maitake, shiitake, and turkey tail\nSlow-release melatonin for sleep\nA toxins binder including bentonite clay, activated charcoal and chlorella\nCistus Incanus tea with stevia, a potential antiviral combination (persistent viral spike-protein theory)\nTurmeric / Curcumin for anti-inflammatory\nGrass fed beef organ meat supplements: pancreas, stomach, intestines, adrenal glands, thymus, liver, etc\nD L-Phenylalanine for cognitive restoration\nBeet root supplement to increase nitric oxide and support liver and gallbladder function\nCustom tick-borne illness herb formula: Japanese Knotweed, Dokudami, Cats Claw, Gou-Teng, Andrographis Paniculata, Sida Acuta, Alchornea cordifolia, Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, Sarsaparilla\nDiamine Oxidase (DAO) supplement to block histamines\nAntiviral Herbs: oregano oil, red sage, holy basil, fennel, garlic, rosemary, echinacea, elderberry, astragalus, ginger, dandelion root and leaves\nBy September, some extensive labs from my functional medicine doctor came back showing I had Babesia, a tick-borne parasitic infection of red blood cells that can cause anemia.  I also had a low CD4/CD8 ratio indicating I had an immunocompromised state. Rather than throw more high-test antibiotics and antimalarials at my shattered body, I decided to start the herbal antibiotics recommended by the functional medicine doctor, as well as Ivermectin (a powerful anti parasitic treatment effective against Babesia, that has become quite infamous during the pandemic). At this point, I was into my third extended fast and seeing some small daily improvements in symptoms and energy. \n\nAs October rolled around, I completed my fourth extended water fast. My bloodwork had also shown low potassium levels and an imbalanced sodium:potassium ratio. I started supplementing with potassium daily and the combination of these two actions ushered in an incredible boost of energy with a complete disappearance of most of the symptoms. Feeling great, I took a risk and did a full body strength training workout for the first time in months, followed by an infrared sauna session. I waited for the PEM crash.  It never came. I woke up the next morning feeling energetic with almost no soreness in my muscles. \n\nThis is where I am today. I decided to create a website sharing what I feel made the most difference in my Long COVID recovery journey as well as the Lyme+co-infections I am recovering from. The treatments for both post-viral chronic illness and Lyme+co-infections are virtually the same, though the specifics may have some variables mixed in.\n\nIf I had to rank the top 5 things that made a difference for me. They would be:\n\nMindset – once I knew I wasn’t imminently dying, I started fighting to survive with a positive outlook.\nTime – the human body is a miraculous living machine, but it takes time to heal from serious trauma of any kind.\nFasting / Autophagy – the level of improvement I saw after each extended fasting session was absolutely incredible!\nHPA Axis Homeostasis Support – The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has a mind-blowing level of complexity and is still not fully understood by the world’s brightest immunologists. There are enough clues though, that with extensive lab testing, supplements, hormone therapies, physical therapies, breath-work, sleep hygiene and ‘doing all the things’ that it IS POSSIBLE to rebalance this vital part of healthy human existence.\nHuman Connections Giving Hope – I can’t tell you how validating it was to find people on Reddit and Facebook groups who were going through the exact experiences as me, having rude doctors telling us it is all in our heads, and worse. We are nothing without community and human connections. Hearing others’ stories of survival, successful treatments, and a return to health is what gave me HOPE in the darkest moments when suicide was a real consideration. I am also thankful for the incredible support from my wife and friends in my life who stepped in to help with all sorts of practical things during the worst of my disability.\nI hope my Long COVID recovery story encourages those still in the thick of debilitating symptoms. And may we all find healing from the deep psychological trauma of this illness.\n\nAll the Love, all the Joy, all the Peace to each of you!\n\n— Josh Champagne, October 2022",

I haven’t actually tripped out yet and I take 1oz at a time. Cannabis also stopped working. THIS IS A CLUE! I didn’t over look it and started to find out why they weren’t working, which led me to begin neurotransmitter testing. I have found my serotonin levels a few ticks above triggering the “too low” alarm. I found in the microclot theory- those insoluble microclots cause neuro inflammation everywhere. That actives the kynurenine pathways, increasing quinolinic acid, and ultimately depleting your main neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine) from near constant activation. \n\nI believe that is where the feeling of the epic loss of self and soul comes from. To test this, I added 5HTP*, a form of tryptophan (the precursor to serotonin) to my supplements. A month later I recognized a glimmer of myself in the mirror one day. Then I started to care for a plant. Then I didn’t watch another one die right before my eyes, day after day. (I used to be an avid gardener) then I started feeling a little more connected to my family. That was at a 200mg/day dose. There is a 400mg/day dose that I am going to try after the neurotransmitter testing! I am very excited to try that! I’ve also noticed that cannabis and psilocybin were more effective (not as much as they should be) when I was taking a combination of 5HTP and complete amino acids WITH tryptophan.  \n\n*MEGA IMPORTANT:* You CANNOT take 5HTP while taking an SSRI anti depressant (like Lexapro). It will result in a dangerous and potentially deadly thing called Serotonin Syndrome. (I inched into this territory on accident and at one point was driving in town and didn’t recognize anywhere. I didn’t know where I was or have any sense of familiarity. I thought “OMFG I need a permanent person with me at all times now?!?!” Thank goodness I caught it quick and corrected it… no permanent damage.) \n\nI think 5HTP and complete amino acids are going to be an integral part of healing in Long COVID, but as we all know… I think anti depressants are the first thing the doctor puts you on when you try to get help. So there’s a very high likelihood that most people are on SSRI anti depressants and would need to work with their doctor/medication specialist to slowly taper off the SSRI in favor of 5HTP. I suspect people will get pushback from their doctors/psychiatrists but the anti depressant isn’t going to work with a serotonin deficiency.",

    "body": "\nHi all,\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I had extreme and sudden swelling in both knees.  After a series of blood tests, acute infection, gout, and Lyme disease were ruled out but inflammatory markers were high.  My rheumatologist’s first take was likely a combination of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, both autoimmune conditions. They rarely know what “triggers” sudden outbreaks like this in seemingly healthy people with no other risk factors— the only things I could point to were a recent sickness that felt Covid-esque (but didn’t test since I’m sick a lot in fall and winter with a 21 month old in daycare) and more drinking and revelry than usual over the preceding 3 weeks (weddings, reunions etc.)\n\nThe swelling was so bad that it didn’t respond to oral steroids or injected cortisone to any meaningful degree.  It was very hard to walk, especially down the stairs… especially with a 33 lb baby.  The fatigue was also completely debilitating for three weeks.  I received methotrexate (the standard RA symptom management treatment) but most people don’t find it super effective particularly for severe RA… and it also has significant long term side effects as an immuno suppressant.  They also put me on a 3 week (!) course of heavy antibiotics to rule out a bacterial infection as a cause (it wasn’t).  I was desperate to figure out the *root cause* of this and drastically changed things up.  I will admit that I didn’t / don’t have the patience for an “elimination” approach so I decided to throw the kitchen sink at it.  Here is what my “protocol” consisted of, in roughly chronological order:\n\n- I stopped taking the longtime supplements I’d been taking to see if maybe that would help.  These were high quality fish oil, glucosamine chondroitin MSM, Thorne ResveraCel (contains Betaine Anhydrous (Trimethylglycine) 85mg,\nNicotinamide Riboside 415mg, Quercetin Phytosome 250mg, Trans-Resveratrol\t150mg) green tea extract and protein bars that have ashwaganda in them (200 mg).\n\n- I cut out gluten and sugar at the suggestion of my rheumatologist to see if that would help.  I already was intermittent fasting (typically 9/15) and continued that.\n\n- I cut out alcohol with the exception of two occasions where I drank only a small amount of gin with soda water.  I would normally drink twice a week and have 6-8 drinks per occasion in a social setting (just being honest and yes I know it’s bad for you)\n\n- after some deep dives into the root cause, some believe that fungal overgrowth of the gut is a probable cause (and mycotoxins they produce) so I began with the following, an antifungal protocol:\n1) Oregano Oil pills (high % carvacol) twice per day\n2) NAC, 2 400 mg pills in the am and 1 in at night\n3) Black seed oil, high quality cold pressed, 1 tsp in the am and 1 in at night\n4) I added back the Thorne ResveraCel\n\n- There is also a strong suspicion that latent viral infections (or even residual spike proteins from cases of Covid and/or the vaccine) could be causing many of these autoimmune issues which are becoming more common.  After some research I decided to try the following:\n1) monolaurin / lauricidin in pellet form, starting at a very low dose.  For those unfamiliar it is apparently very similar to the colostrum that is so vital to babies’ health in the early weeks of their life and is claimed to be effective at rooting out latent viral and bacterial infections (EBV especially).  \n2) Thorne Quercetin Bromelain \n\n- After I went heavy into the world of anti-inflammatories (many of which also seem to have antifungal and antibacterial properties), I also layered in the following.  I’ll admit at this point I felt like a supplement “junkie” but I will say when you are experiencing a sense of desperation about your health and need to function as a parent, you will leave no stone unturned:\n1) Thorne Curcumin Phytosome\n2) Homemade concoction of ginger root, turmeric root, pineapple, orange, pomegranate (whole seeds), honey.  Frozen into cupcake tins to use over weeks. \n\nAfter 2 months of some combination of these, I’m happy to report that I am feeling as good or better than my old self in many ways.  I’m skinnier than I’ve been in years (even though I was fit before), have regained energy, am sleeping better, and have much less brain fog (I’m assuming alcohol was probably the biggest culprit here but hard to tell since I eliminated so much).  My knees are good enough to walk about 35 minutes every other day on the treadmill at 15 degree incline but not good enough to run on (there was a lot of damage done to the knees in only 6 weeks of severe RA based on an MRI I had somewhat recently…). \n\nI will keep updating my determined journey to full health if anyone is interested, particularly if I find anything that really helps other with similar conditions.  I was in a very dark place 6 weeks ago and I feel very fortunate to be on the other side now!",

I use thewor remission  carefully since most of society has decided that using the word remission is considered a very foul and bad word. Don't get me started on using the word cure. \n\nI wouldn't say necessarily that I biohacked my RA but rather gave my body nutrients it badly needed. I had a crappy diet and no interest in nutrition my whole childhood and teenage life. Something I'm now regretting a lot. \n\nI started on methotrexate and prednisone. My body accepted those things just fine and my doctor monitored me closely. Living in a rural area though,  made me financially unable to continue on the medications and seeing the RA doctor. So I ventured into the holistic  and natural world of medicine and started on several different nutrients. \n\nSome of those nutrients were Turmeric, proteolytic enzymes (probably spelled it wrong), essential fatty acids, and antioxidant rich fruits and vegetables. I worked with my doctor on incorporating these things and told him I can't afford to keep seeing him every month as well as taking the medications since methotrexate isn't the best for your health in my opinion. I had to be careful who I was around and stuff. Thankfully my doctor didn't take it wrong and worked with me on my new regimen of supplements that used natural ingredients and things. Over years of taking the new regimen now, I had managed to finally be off meds all together and into remission. \n\n\nNow I don't mean to give anyone false hope on this subject or discussion. I didn't cure RA and I still have RA. I still experience pain and inflammation all the time but at a very reduced rate compared to before.  I now only experience about 10 percent of RA symptoms and things. Plus what works for me doesn't mean it'll work for others. Everyone's body is made differently and works differently. Especially when it comes to absorbing nutrients and even allergies to some nutrients. I suggest working with your doctor so they can monitor the progress or lack thereof of using nutrients that are included in your regimen.",

    "body": "At this point, I'm sure you've come across all of the information for what causes TMAU smell (inability to effectively convert TMA -> TMAO due to reduced activity of FMO3 enzyme in liver). I've put together a step-by-step process that \"cured\" my TMAU based on all of the relevant scientific research on the topic and decided to share because I want the best for all you dudes.  \n\n\n* **Reducing Acute TMA Production**\n\nThe first step to inhibiting smell is to stop the immediate production of high levels of TMA, as it's your inability to oxidize it that is the problem. In those without TMAU, levels of TMAO can give us an indicator for what would elevate levels of TMA in TMAU populations.  \n\n\n\\- [Research shows that seafood consumption is the ONLY thing that significantly raises acute levels of TMA/TMAO when compared to a control (water)](https://33q47o1cmnk34cvwth15pbvt120l-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/TMA1-267x300.jpg) or even other high choline foods such as eggs, liver, milk etc. FWIW, they tested almost 50 different foods that fell under the categories: fruits/veggies/legumes, breads/cereals, meat/poultry, dairy/eggs and seafood. The only non-seafoods that rose levels of TMA above the control (water) baseline were: peas, cauliflower (brassica veggies tend to increase TMA), liver, mushrooms, although none of them hit the mark for statistical significance. (Zhang et al., 1999). Research also shows that, even when eating extremely high doses of TMA precursors (choline; 6 whole eggs), [TMA/TMAO levels peak around 8 hours after consumption and return to baseline in 24 hours](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4135488/).  \n\n\n**Solution:** Remove ALL fish/seafood (this includes kelp/seaweed) from your diet, if you intend to be in public within the next 24 hours, as they increase ACUTE (immediate) levels of TMA. No other food *needs* to be eliminated to reduce **acute** production, although limiting the quantity of certain high choline foods, as well as those listed above may be useful. Should you consume any of those foods in high doses (e.g. 6+ eggs), ensure it is not within 24 hours of a time you intend to be in public. (i.e. eat a TMA/TMA precursor containing meal by 8 PM Friday, at the latest, if you know you have a date at 8 PM on Saturday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Reducing Chronic TMA Production**\n\nAfter reducing the levels of acute TMA produced, the second most important thing: controlling the systemic levels of TMA production. Long story short: short of seafood consumption, TMA is produced when we consume things like choline or carnitine. Our gut bacteria break down these compounds and produce TMA as a byproduct. It is important to understand this because WE do not produce TMA, it's merely our gut bacteria that do. Remove the gut bacteria responsible for this and you remove the TMA production. [Research shows that when vegans/vegetarians consume the same products as omnivorous humans, they do not produce TMA](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/red-meat-tmao-and-your-heart), because they lack the gut bacteria for it. Simply put, eat a low carnitine diet, the bacteria that consume it to live will die. When those bacteria die off, you can eat the same foods and **you won't produce TMA**. This is something that many people have read before. Stories of people \"curing\" their TMAU by becoming vegan/vegetarian. The problem is it's extremely hard for many people to give up meat.  \n\n\nGood news! [Recent research within the past year has shown that the bacteria that produce TMA and, thus, chronic TMA/TMAO levels are ONLY increased in those who consume red meat (beef/pork/lamb etc.) but NOT white meat (poultry)](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/40/7/583/5232723). TMA/TMAO production was equivalent (virtually no TMA/TMAO production) in people who consumed no meat as well as those who consumed poultry. When the groups consumed red meat, levels of systemic TMA/TMAO production skyrocketed, as well as acute TMA/TMAO production even when consuming the same foods. The study also found that a maximum of 4 weeks of removing red meat from the diet was enough to completely change the gut microbiome to inhibit TMA/TMAO production. All groups (vegetarian, chicken, red meat) consumed eggs/dairy as well, so the positive news is that those foods have no effect on chronic TMA/TMAO levels. (Wang et al., 2019)  \n\n\n**Solution:** No need to eat a completely restricted diet to alter gut microbiome and reduce chronic TMA/TMAO production. *Red meat is the only food you'll need to remove from your diet*. Eggs, dairy and chicken have no effect on the long-term production. [Research also shows that vegetarian meat products, such as Beyond Meat Burgers, also do not increase TMA/TMAO](https://www.healio.com/news/cardiology/20200820/plantbased-meat-products-reduce-trimethylaminenoxide-other-cvd-risk-factors), so those can act as an alternative, if you're missing red meat. Also, the alteration of your microbiome isn't a short-term process. This doesn't mean you can never eat red meat again. As a matter of fact, eating red meat will result in no increase in TMA/TMAO levels if your gut isn't adapted to it. Having red meat once a month or so will be completely fine. Just don't do it consistently or you will begin to produce more TMA producing bacteria.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Improving FMO3 Activity**\n\nHonestly, this might be the biggest thing right here. As, although the focus of the first two was reducing TMA production, the problem that those with TMAU suffer from isn't TMA production, but the inability to effectively convert said TMA into TMAO, an action that the FMO3 enzyme is responsible for in \"healthy\" populations. If you increase the activity of the FMO3 gene, you increase the amount of TMA that gets oxidized into the odourless TMAO and thus reduce body odour. The most effective way to do this: Vitamin B^(2) (Riboflavin). Vitamin B^(2) enhances liver function, including that of the FMO3 enzyme. Multiple studies on people suffering from TMAU have shown that Vitamin B^(2) supplementation drastically reduces or even completely eliminates all body odour linked to TMAU, even in the absence of changes to the diet. Populations who were [born with inherited TMAU (defective FMO3)](https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-019-1174-6) as well those who had [diet-obtained TMAU](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509925/) all saw a drastic, or even complete inhibition of their body odour/TMAU due to improved TMA -> TMAO oxidation. The dose seems to be supplementation of approximately 100mg/day, although ranges of 50-200mg have all proved successful. Also, Brassica vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower etc.) may reduce FMO3 activity as well as increase TMA production, so limit/avoid such foods.\n\n**Solution:** Take 100mg of Vitamin B^(2) (Riboflavin) once a day, every day. There's a long-term saturation effect meaning you must take it every day (however don't be OCD, you won't die/set yourself back if you miss a day, of course) and the longer you take it, the better the results will be. i.e. symptoms will be better after 4 weeks on riboflavin than they were after 2 weeks, and so on, with a \"peak\" after 6-12 months or so. Timing doesn't matter as it has no acute effects (you won't smell better immediately after taking it, it's a cumulative process that takes weeks of consistent supplementation). Take it in the morning, noon, or night, doesn't matter. Just take it. Also limit/avoid brassicas (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, brussel sprouts).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Get Rid of TMA on Skin**\n\nThe reason TMAU results in body odour is excess TMA that cannot be converted to odourless TMAO gets excreted, primarily through sweat glands. This means you must wash away/remove TMA from the skin. TMA has very high pH. The problem is most body washes also have a high pH (as higher pH's cut through grease, dirt and skin oils better). In order to optimally break down/remove TMA from the skin, you should add a low pH body wash to your arsenal. This does NOT mean ditch the high pH body washes because, as previously mentioned, they do a great job of removing other, non-TMAU-related odour-causing compounds from the skin. But finishing a shower with a low pH body wash to both wash away TMA as well as lower pH of the skin to reduce the ability of TMA to form on it will be extremely beneficial. Any body-wash that says \"pH skin-balanced\" will work fine. You can Google/Amazon search for low pH body washes. Some are great and extremely low in pH, but most will just destroy your pockets. You're better off going with affordable body washes that are pH skin balanced, as they're still on the acidic side and will get the job done. Nivea & Sanex are probably the easiest ones to get your hands on.\n\n**Solution:** Take a normal shower with regular shower products. Wash hair, face, body etc. After all of that, finish your shower by washing again with a low pH body wash, such as Nivea or Sanex. Nivea also makes pH Balanced 3-in-1 products that you can use for your hair, face and body, if that interests you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  ***Should you use Chlorophyll/Activated Charcoal?***\n\nShort answer: It may help at times, but is not necessary, provided you did all of the above. Especially not regularly.  \n\n\nI have seen anecdotes of people saying the supplements removed their symptoms, and there is also research proving [both charcoal and copper chlorophyllin (chlorophyll) supplements can inhibit smell/urinary TMA excretion in populations suffering from TMAU](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15043988/), when taken individually (One or the other works. It's not necessary to take both supplements together). The problem with this is both likely have drawbacks. Chlorophyll contains high levels of copper, which can be toxic if taken in excess and activated charcoal absorbs not only TMA, but also important vitamins/minerals from the foods you eat.   \n\n\nFor this reason, I wouldn't recommend taking either supplements daily, BUT should you want to control **acute** TMA production, taking them either independently, or together along with the meal you want to reduce TMA production from, can be a useful tool. E.g. You're out for breakfast with friends and want an omelette, but would prefer not to smell later on in the day as you have important plans. Taking chlorophyll tablets/activated charcoal tablet (one or the other will work, but both in accordance may work better) WITH your meal, will improve symptoms. Use this sparingly, however. And if you do use it often, give yourself a brief detox, at least.  \n\n\nAs stated earlier, however, if you're doing all of the above tips, chlorophyll/charcoal won't be necessary, anyway.  \n\n\n*  ***Should you use antibiotics/probiotics?***\n\nAntibiotics: Fuck no. Antibiotics work to reduce TMA production/TMAU symptoms through the same pathway as dietary red-meat removal. Difference being, removing red meat from your diet won't screw your immune system up, ruin your healthy gut bacteria, give you GI distress, increase likelihood of candida infections and reduce the efficacy of antibiotics in your future. Just remove red meat from your diet. As stated earlier you can still have it on occasion, anyway.  \n\n\nProbiotics: Haven't seen enough research to prove it has any effect, positive or negative, on TMAU. I'd say only take them for non-TMAU-related reasons.\n\n**TL;DR Summary:**\n\nI highly recommend reading the above because understanding the whys are just as important as understanding the whats, but in case you're too lazy to read:\n\nDon't eat fish/seafood, red meat and brassica vegetables. Don't eat high-choline/carnitine/betaine meals within 24 hours of going out. Take Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) every day. Include pH balanced body washes to your showers. Charcoal/Chlorophyll are unnecessary but may help to control acute TMA production - just use them periodically. Antibiotics are a no-no.\n\nEDIT: (07/21) 1. Avoid Dairy-Based Protein Shakes. Whey/Casein protein is a culprit of elevated chronic TMA levels through the same pathway as carnitine. Vegan protein shakes are a fine substitute.\n\n2. Remove other “sneaky” sources of carnitine from your diet, as well. Energy drinks and some exercise supplements are sometimes high in carnitine. Remove all energy drinks from your diet and check the info on any pre-workout before buying it.",

I think a more vegetarian/vegan diet has worked for me, although it was more coincidence that I did it, rather than doing for tmau reasons. I'm not exactly vegan now and eat a reasonable amount of meat, but we've had a few months here and there of mostly vegan foods. What you've said about red meat makes sense and maybe that's why I'm doing better.\n\nThings I'm not so sure about: cutting out brassica? Broccoli/cauliflower etc are fairly staple veges in my diet. I think eating a lot more spinach helped (natural additional chlorophyll) but in general the more veges and more green you include the less crap you're going to be eating, which can only be good.\n\nAlso, riboflavin has been a 'thing' for 30 years, it makes your pee turn orange but if it worked there'd be more concrete studies/ success stories by now. I'd maybe recommend a few months of drinkable chlorophyll, it didn't hurt when I did it.\n\nThe one thing I'd additionally recommend (my own personal conspiracy) is cutting out is whey. For context, my parents noticed my condition as a baby, from odd smelling nappies. No fish, no meat or egg in my diet then, just breast milk. I usually don't have too many issues with dairy, but breast milk is high in whey, and other foods I've had with high whey (icecream, protein powders) don't work well for me.",

probably not gonna use their serum since I have serums for that. has mild fragrance so be careful!\n\n**status** : still in use and will always beee\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**emulsion** time!\n\n**Etude House Soonjung 10 Free Moist Emulsion**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. : 1250 for 120ml (Bought for Rs. 1000) from nykka\n\n**humectant** : glycerin, propanediol , butylene glycol and  panthenol\n\n**for skin type** : all! sensitive, dry, combination, oily and acne prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thin white lotion . unscented . takes a bit time to absorb fully.\n\na subreddit recommendation! really lotion like and not that hydrating. to me, it felt a bit heavy and sticky and for some reason, takes way too much time to sink in. once that's done, applying any serum feels heavy on my skin. on the hydration its moderate for me . haven't been using for that long (2 months) so lets see if the verdict changes!\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**essences**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TONYMOLY  The Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Essence**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1500 for 55ml ( bought for Rs. 750) from nykka\n\n**humectant** : cyclomethicone , propanediol and glycerin\n\n**for skin types** : all!

I tried the snail mucin from earth rhythm before this (simply, no and also coming up) and this is miles better than that. makes my skin very plumpy and soft . of course top it off with a gel and completes the routine on a lazy day lol. soothes all acne irritation and dryness . not sure how it will work on oily skin but a goody for all sensitive ,acne prone and dry bishes.\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Earth Rhythm Renew Overnight Gel with 70% Snail Mucin**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 900 for 50ml (bought for Rs. 600) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : snail mucin , hyaluronic acid, aloe vera juice and acetamido ethoxyethanol\n\n**for skin types** : normal and oily\n\n**texture and appearance** : cloudy thin gel . feels kind of watery . unscented.\n\nwhat a waste of money. 1 out of 2 earth rhythm products I tried and both of them broke me out and are clown realness  🤡. it feels like thin coat of Vaseline on the face and even though its a sleeping mask its not hydrating (thought id mention it in essences since its the only sleeping mask w/ humectants I have lol) and sure as hell doesn't calm the skin. made my acne worse and just doesn't fulfill its purpose. wouldn't recommend to anyone .\n\n**status** :  not in use\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**serums**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nget ready for a bandwagon of hyaluronic acid variations XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**minimalist hyaluronic acid 2% + vitamin B4**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 500) from beminimalist\n\n**humectant**: hyaluronic acid, aloe vera juice, panthenol, propanediol and ethoxydiglycol.\n\n**for skin types** ; all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick clear liquid . unscented .\n\nhydrating goodness! first was using it on dry skin but works the best on damp skin. absorbs really quickly and was my first hyaluronic acid serum. used more than required so ran out of it pretty quickly but around  5 drops are enough for the whole face. great for anyone really , so versatile!\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**deconstruct hydrating serum**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 500) from amazon\n\n**humectants** : hyaluronic acid , butylene glycol, anhydroxylitol , xylitol , xylitylglucoside  and sodium gluconate\n\n**for skin types** : all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick clear liquid kind of like cosrx snail mucin . unscented but mine somehow had a cardboard like smell .\n\ngood! overall I had a better experience with minimalist . this serum was just a bit too heavy and greasy for me . it took a really long time for it to absorb and sometimes just sat on the skin. and plus the smell was a bit nauseating . but al in all , it gave good hydration . stinged a bit when skin was irritated so not the biggest fan of this.\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neutrogena hydro boost capsule in serum**\n\n**Mrp :** Rs. 800 for 30 ml (bought for Rs. 720) from nykka\n\n**humectants :** glycerin, propanediol, butylene glycol, caprylyl glycol, panthenol, hyaluronic acid , sucrose and pca.\n\n**for skin types** : all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thin gel like . capsules are powdery but when mixed with gel , they disappear. heavily scented so wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin.\n\nliteral money-bait. did absolutely nothing. and felt so guilty after buying it ! its alternative hydro boost gel was so much better! (also coming up) don't even remember this one clearly, but much expected difference wasn't seen , sadly.\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**L'Oréal  Revitalift 1.5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 999 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 550) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, hyaluronic acid and pentalene glycol\n\n**for skin types** : all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : clear liquid . unscented.\n\nHG HA acid forever!! finally found it! tried the 15ml variant first and loved it instantly . super hydrating and soothing. not sticky and absorbs within 2-3 minutes. great base for the whole routine and still going on after 3 months ! not irritating or stingy on sensitive skin at all as well as good for oily skin too since its a lower concentration! loveeee\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NEW!*** **minimalist lactic acid 10% + HA 1%**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 570)\n\n**humectants** : lactic acid , aloe vera juice, hyaluronic acid, propanediol, ethoxydiglycol, glycerin.\n\n**for skin types** : TBD\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale-clear yellow . sour scent but no added perfume. really thin and watery.\n\njust got this . will update in a few months !\n\n**status** : TBD\n\n**rating** : TBD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NEW!*** **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Water Essence Serum**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1790 for 50ml (bought for Rs. 1253) from maccaron\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, hyaluronic acid , betaine, sodium pca, trehalose, panthenol, pentalene glycol, butylene glycol, beta-glucan and polyquaternium-51 .\n\n**for skin types** : TBD\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid . unscented.\n\njust got this , so verdict is coming soon!\n\n**status** : TBD\n\n**rating** : TBD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**gels**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pond's Super Light Gel**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 430 for 247gm (bought for Rs. 365) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, butylene glycol, sodium pca, hyaluronic acid, pentylene glycol\n\n**for skin types** : dry, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : light blue liquidy-gel . heavily scented  ( has different citrus extracts) .\n\ngood! really lightweight and hydrating. has a very heavy citrus like smell and definitely wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin. isn't greasy at all and absorbs well. great for both winters and summers and even use it on my body!\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neutrogena hydro boost water gel**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1000 for 50 ml ( bought for Rs. 855) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, butylene glycol, dimethiconol , hyaluronic acid\n\n**for skin types** : dry , oily, combination and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : light blue liquidy-gel . scented .\n\namazingggg! could've been my HG if it wasn't for the price 🤡. still really hydrating and light. best gel for acne-prone skin as it really decreased the no. of outbreaks and soothes all aggravation. again is scented, so not the best choice for sensitive skin. prefer this over ponds but the cost sis 🥲\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**moisturizers**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 400 for 45ml (bought for Rs. 360) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : glycerin, pentylene glycol , xylitol, caprylyl glycol, mannitol , rhamnose and fructooligosachharides.\n\n**for skin types** : dry , sensitive and acne-prone.\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. unscented.\n\ngodsent. literally. HG moisturizer besides Cetaphil DAM (cheaper alternative) . boon for sensitive and dehydrated skin. skin saver during my whole tretinoin journey. extremely hydrating and soothing. works similar to boroline on dry patches around nose and mouth . and non-pore clogging! admittedly a little heavy and non-absorbing which is why I might not use it in summers.\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all from my side !!also I did not use all of these products at the same time. I'm writing everything from memory since some products were used +3 years ago . even those still in use, I alternate between them on days since I don't need to apply them everyday and all. so most of my products last for a very long time since I combined them and alternate between them. of course, patch test first and thankfully, none of them reacted in a bad way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsuggestions from the subreddit \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfollowing products were subreddit recs and I haven't used them at all , so ya'll can search more about them an maybe give them a try!\n\n* irem hyaluronic acid serum (HA)\n* pyungkang yul mist toner\n* inkey list polyglutamic acid\n* herbivore cloud jelly serum\n* the ordinary NMF moisturizer\n\nthere are a lot more but I'm too lazy to read all of them . do mention your HG in the comments!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthere are many other humectants that I haven't mentioned , like niacinamide which is present in trace amounts in almost all products. personally, never tried any products with honey extract in it (I figured snail mucin does a better job , but who knows) . for newer products, ill update them one I'm done trying them for at least 2 months (or let me know if you guys want it any earlier , I got no issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway I hope this list helps out ! I didn't have any knowledge about humectants while my skin was being tortured by over-exfoliation and I was looking like a baboon's ass so take care of your skin so it doesn't look like this 🥵 also this took a long time , so leaving an upvote will feel nice 🥰",

    "body": "## \n\n## Hey all, Welcome to another deep dive into supplements often flogged by supplement companies. Today we are going to be going to Carnitine, what does, what it doesn't do and how good it is at doing it. \n\n## \n\n## What is L-Carnitine.\n\nCarnitine is a conditionally essential natural chemical derived from amino acids, though we can make it within our bodies and gain it from our diet some people may not be getting enough. Since Carnitine is formed from lysine and methionine as long as you are eating a complete protein source at a high enough level there shouldn't be any issue here. \n\n  \n**What does it do.**\n\n  \nCarnitine has two main roles within the body. A part of its structure carries long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria of cell to be used as fuel, the second role is in waste removal from the mitochondria preventing toxic build up within the cell. For this reaoson Carnitine is concentrated within the skeletal and cardiac muscles \\[[1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Carnitine-HealthProfessional/#en1),[2](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Carnitine-HealthProfessional/#en2)\\].Beyond simple nutrient shuttling Carnitine has been shown to play a role in androgen receptor uptake after resistance training and feeding \\[[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826026/),[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12930169/)\\].  \n**Forms of Carnitine.**  \n\n\n* **Acetyl L-carnitine:** Sometimes refereed to as ALCAR, this form is bound to acetyl acid as it more readily allows Carnitine to pass the blood brain barrier as well as the gut [\\[5\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742407500127) \n* **D-carnitine:** This type is the optical isomer (mirror image) of L-carnitine. It is toxic to the body, as it may inhibit the absorption of other forms of Carnitine. [\\[6\\]](https://www.caymanchem.com/product/16749/d-carnitine)\n* **L-carnitine L-tartrate:** This form of Carnitine is bound to Tartrate acid which is essentially an inert acid used only to stabilise the Carnitine allowing to to be more bio available and not break down as fast in the gut. This is the form that this analysis will focus on, as it is most widely used in the research I have read.\n* **Propionyl-L-carnitine:** This form, while similar to the Acetyl form can pass the blood brain easier than plain Carnitine, however research suggests that it may be more effect  at what it does [\\[8\\]](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/69/5/279/1935071#112305826) \n* **L-carnitine:** This Carnitine is what is produced in the body, though taking orally it will break down with poor absorption rates, which is what the bound compounds seek to avoid. [\\[9\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15591001/) \n\nBefore we continue I would like to reiterate that this analysis will focus on the **L-carnitine L-tartrate (LCLT)** and not the other compounds. This is because they have slightly differing mechanisms of action that are beyond the scope of this breakdown, if there is appetite further breakdowns on individual forms then I may go into those as well.  \n\n\n## Practical application\n\n### Androgen Receptor up-regulation.\n\nRelatively recent research has shown LCTL supplementation has been able to increase the amount of androgen receptors in muscles at rest before exercise as well as increasing AR count post exercise with the addition of a post workout meal consisting of all three macro nutrients against placebo. \\[[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826026/)\\] The increased number and density of androgen receptors in muscles allows Testosterone to then bind to the AR pathing the way to faster recovery [\\[10\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12930169/).   \n**Speculation**\n\n  \nIt isn't clear how effective this is in the long term for muscle building and strength as these studies simply do not exist. Though we do know for certain that AR expression plays a fundamental role in resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy. [\\[11\\]](https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12986-020-00446-y) Because we know the association between AR content and muscle size it would stand to reason that LCTL AR upregulating ability should promote muscle hypertrophy in resistance trained individuals. There is of-course the caveat that again we don't know much about the ratio of free Testosterone binding to these new free ARs, which would directly effect how effective this supplement is in building muscle. \n\n  \n**Note**  \nInterestingly one study measuring IGF-1 (growth hormone) post exercise with LCTL supplementation showed a marked increase against control [\\[4\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12930169/) The study suggests this is another mechanism of action to explain the increased recovery seen with LCTL.   \n\n\n### Fat loss.\n\nAs LCTL shuttles fats into the cell to be used as energy over sugars it has been long suggested and advertised as a fat burning agent but the research here has been sketchy and a bit light on the ground. The best argument for LCTL as a fat burning agent is when used in conjunction with some form of medium to low exertion cardio [\\[11\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099008/) through its lipid oxidisation and glycogen sparing abilities. As a stand alone agent though, it is pretty much worthless as a fat burner. [\\[12\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12378044/) [\\[13\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15929637/) [\\[14\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31743774/)   \npotential application: If you want take LCTL 30 mins before low intensity steady state (LISS) cardio, for example, walking. Though LCTL supplementation alone will not be as effective or at all without a calorie deficit.  \n\n\n### Endurance.\n\nSupplementing at 3-4g of LCTL researchers found 26 candidate professional American footballers had a significant increase in exercise performance that titrated up in intensity before exhaustion [\\[15\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24263659/), however another study on endurance trained athletes running marathon showed no benefit at all [\\[16\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8803503/). \n\npotential application: \n\nTake LCTL for HIT style workouts, but forget it for endurance style training.   \n\n\n### Recovery\n\nSupplementing LCTL at 3-4g again has showed that immediately after exercise blood markers indicated decrease oxidative stress post exercise [\\[17\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25289711/). The reenforces the idea that LCTL promotes recovery post resistance or high intensity style workouts. Another study supplementing at 2g with resistance trained individuals showed similar results in muscle soreness and stress [\\[18\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049509004879)   \npotential application: Again take LCTL for HIT style workouts, but forget it for endurance style training.  \n\n\n### Cardiovascular health\n\nIt has been shown that supplementing with Carnitine has had some positive effect in all cause mortality, decreasing it by 27% as well as positive outcomes for those who have gone through heart attacks.[\\[19\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23597877/) Another study reenforces with showing supplementation may decrease early death from heart related issues [\\[20\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16685128/) \n\n  \n**Note**  \nDoses where not stated in these studies and they report that further testing on the efficacy and safety of LCTL supplementation is needed. If you decide to take LCTL for cardiovascular health for existing conditions I would advice first consulting with your Doctor.  \n\n\n### Mental Health\n\nMental decline in the elderly has been shown to be alleviated in one studying showing all markers from, mental fatigue to physical fatigue to be reduced in this supplementing with 2g of LCTL. [\\[21\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18065594/) Another again conducted on the elderly reduced symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia. [\\[22\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2178869/) It is suggested that due to the nutrient shuttling capability of LCTL the energy efficiency is increased thus reducing the mental fatigue and other symptoms.  \nPractical application:It is impossible to say at this time if LCTL is effective as a nootropic for otherwise cognitively healthy people wanting a cognitive boost. This meta analysis suggests that until better research is conducted LCTL is probably not worth perusing as a cognitive enhancer [\\[23\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28349514/)   \n\n\n### Infertility in males\n\nThe Carnitine content in seminal fluid is directly correlated to the amount and mobility of sperm \\[[24](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6430725/),[25](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10929687/)\\] suggesting that it may be beneficial in treating infertility in men. Several studies have been shown to increase sperm count, mobility and quality on men treated for infertility. I will link 4 studies that all dosed between 2-3g for several months, each of these showed positive markers on the mens sperm quality \\[[26](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8085668/),[27](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8529529/),[28](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11679516/),[29](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12568837/)\\] Thankfully the quality of evidence here is pretty compelling and for once, isn't clouded in poor, or lack of, research.\n\n### Dosing\n\nDosing is all over the shot in the litriture for LCTL, ranging from .5g to 6g per day. This can be explained by its poor bioavailability when taken orally and lack of consistently clear research.Based on there studies I have linked here showing LCTL to be beneficial taking 2-6g per day before some form of exercise seems to be the most efficacious.   \n\n\n### Side effects \n\nIt has been reported that doses up to 3g has the potential to cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, and a “fishy” body odour. though these finings are very inconsistent and very poorly understood.   \nIt has been reported that LCTL causes an increase in TMAO in the gut that has been linked to cardiovascular disease. [\\[30\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23563705/) \n\n  \n**Note**  \nGut TMAO production can be decreased though the supplementation of allicin [\\[31\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464615001735) which can either be supplemented with raw, crushed garlic or as a extracted powder. There is also the potential of DMB from Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil to reduce TMAO levels [\\[32\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4871610/)  \nCarnitine can also be injected IM which will bypass the gut and TMAO production. However, at least in my country it is not possible to get injectable Carnitine for recreational use.   \n\n\n  \n**The bottom line**  \nLCTL has been around the block for a long time with research covering many different avenues, unfortunately a lot of it is inconstant and not particularly clear. This is a painfully consistent message with many compounds in the fitness industry. Regardless, the initial research is promising and may well end up being an effective compound for muscle growth.  \nAnecdotally I have recently been supplementing with 4g of LCTL for the past 8 weeks alongside the rest of my supplement stack and have noticed fairly significant trend in relation to my body weight and gym performance while on a 250-500 cal deficit, I still have a few months supply left but if the trend continues I will be replacing my stock and continuing. Personally I would recommend the product to those wanting to make the most out of their training.\n\n  \n**Parting Words**\n\nThis breakdown was a fairly research intense one, so I do hope you enjoyed it. to reiterate if further analysis on the other forms of Carnitine is wanted then I can go into detail on those in a later breakdown. As always I am open to suggestions in what you want to see next, if non are forth coming then I will default to Betaine. I will happily answer any questions you may have below.",

I barely sweat when I'm not taking that supplement. \n\nI've only used this supplement with advanced level bodybuilding, in a HIIT style.\n\nBased on your review, I'll restart using it, the Tartrate bound version.\n\nWould be great if you looked into Phosphatidic Acid at some point!",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin.

I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( .

I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet.

I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation.

I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "\n\n\n**Background**\n\n\nI was a pretty normal guy until shortly after my 3rd year in college hit (2016). In that year, I soon noticed myself becoming apathetic to stuff everyone cared about like the popular movies or hanging out with friends/family. At the time I thought it was a phase, but that apathy kept expanding and within a few years (2019) it encompassed my entire life. I'll break it down below (all the symptoms are chronic):\n\n\n**Symptoms**\n\n*Apathy* - I still feel emotions, but they're 1/10 as strong as they once were. Like they're frozen or trapped in deep ice. Life is basically flat, and compared to the average person I don't feel emotions at all - to the extent of letting my life fall apart because nothing feels important. Any emotion I do feel occurs only once, as a response to new stimuli. Even if I do that same thing again after that, it goes back to feeling like nothing.\n\n\n*Anhedonia* - Nothing is enjoyable. When I get home from work, I watch youtube or sleep. Doing anything else is expending energy for no return. Everything that used to feel good (talking with people, watching movies, listening to falling rain) is just empty. \n\n\n*Reduced sensitivity* - My hearing is like that of an old man. Often people standing right next to me address me and I don't notice because it's so soft I assume they're far away. My sense of smell doesn't work unless I put something right under my nose and inhale very hard. Food tastes like cardboard. Sex feels like always wearing a condom. And strangely I think my eyes see less color than before. This also extends to various drugs - alcohol no longer gives me a buzz (though I still get the lowered inhibitions + spinny room thing). Day and night feel the same.\n\n\n*Memory loss* - Nearly all my past memories are gone. Details of shows I watched, people I hung out with, games I played, my childhood, it's all gone. Putting new things into memory is also extremely hard (a nightmare for studying).\n\n\n*Irritability* - This one is weird. I'm just irritable at random times every day. Certain pitches of sound agitate now in a way they never did. This happens with certain speaking voices a lot, and they become really painful to listen to.\n\n\n*Weight loss* - I was 230 lbs./104 kg. at the start of 2014. By the end, I was 160-170 lbs. or 72-75 kg. This occurred the same time my other symptoms were worsening. The strange part of this I recall is that I put no major effort into losing weight - it simply happened by eating and acting the way I always did. Right now, I think there's some barrier that prevents me from gaining more weight. When I eat more than usual, my stomach is simply totally full and it can stay that way for days.\n\n\n*Physical irritation* - My stomach feels tight and irritated all the time, and I can only defecate 1-2 times per week, sometimes not at all. When I do it's always painful and difficult, even when I make sure to eat fiber. Also, oddly the temple of my head feels weird and \"blocked\" all the time, like a stone. This is the same region that feels activated when you actually do feel emotions and pleasure, so I'm sure this is important.\n\n\n*Sleep deprivation* - Any time I get stressed, I lose the ability to sleep altogether. Even small stressors, like college exams, usually cause this. My circadian rhythm also slips quite easily and I've \"inverted\" it by accident many times, waking up at dusk and sleeping at dawn. This never happened before the illness.\n\n\n*Derealization* - Not to be confused with depersonalization. It's feeling totally removed from your environment. When out in public, I feel like a self-driving car with no driver at the wheel, my body is there but I'm not. \n\n\n**Attempted Treatments**\n\n*Counseling* - I saw a church counselor as a teenager, but as you can imagine, it didn't help anything. He kept saying I was in a \"funk\" whereas I thought the problem must be physiological, and since talking about my (mostly nonexistent) emotions didn't do anything, I stopped going and swore off the idea of therapy.\n\n\n*Antidepressants* - I've taken Sertraline, Bupropion, Nortriptyline, Tranylcypromine, and a host of others (5-6) that I regrettably didn't keep track of. I took all for 4+ weeks and yet none had -any- effects positive or negative save for the Nortriptyline and Tranylcypromine (The NTP gave me dry mouth, the TCP gave me hypotension, but both oddly made me enjoy music more for a week before pooping out). Due to a limited budget and feeling like ADs were a waste of time for me, I've lost hope with them too.\n\n\n*Supplements* - Lots of vitamins, a multi-vitamin, Betaine HCL, Sarcosine + NAC, NSI-189, Ashwagandha, probably forgetting some others. As you could have predicted, no effect.\n\n\n*Meditation* - This is an odd one. When all my other emotions stopped working, I started meditating and was shocked that the \"calmness\" accompanying meditation still worked in me, and I thought there was some meaning in that. But a few months later I tried it again and that sensation was gone too, with no return. So I gave up.\n\n\n*Exercise* - I took up jogging for a few weeks, it seemed to do absolutely nothing so I gave it up. \n\n\n*Diet* - I have tried eating healthier on and off but it didn't help. Also, certain healthy foods like chicken upset my stomach on occasion and I have no clue why. My stomach seems to dislike fruit as well - especially bananas. I have no clue why. I often resort to junk food specifically because it feels like it won't upset my stomach. I visited a G.E. who had my bloodwork done but she said everything looked normal.\n\n\n*Improving my life* - Tried making friends, going to college, getting a job, getting a car, getting a girlfriend. I did all of it. And still felt like crap. \n\n\n**Possible Origins**\n\n*#1) Trauma* - When all this disease stuff started, I was 13. By the time it hit rock bottom, I was 17. During that timespan, my family collapsed, and there were awful shouting matches going for hours every day at points. Sadly, the most likely explanation for the disease is that it's a latent problem that was triggered as a result of the stressor: The lasting damage is not due to the \"trauma\" though - it's not PTSD - it merely used the stress as a trigger. Mental illness (particularly addiction) runs through my family too.\n\n\n*#2) Some weird stomach problem* - There's evidence for this as well. For one, most people in the Anhedonia subreddit never mention stomach problems (they largely get anhedonia from meds -- I never tried an antidepressant until the disease was severe), while stomach issues are a huge factor in my illness. Two, sometimes I'll eat a specific way and have a brief \"window\" where my sense of smell starts working again. For example, last Winter I quit sugar for a month and my sense of smell improved (and went back to baseline soon after). And a month or two ago, I had it again after eating some European chocolates from the store. But again, couldn't replicate it.\n\n\n*#3) Something dopamine related* - I drink coffee obsessively, because it keeps me from being a complete zombie. Nortriptyline and Tranylcypromine also act on dopamine AFAIK, and they had a positive effect on me, so I believe this is relevant. But it's likely just one facet of the problem - i.e. not the direct cause.\n\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nNothing really makes sense. There are no ups or downs like you see in most depression cases, nor feelings of guilt or worthlessness, nor suicidal ideation. So I'm really tempted to reject the depression idea. It feels like there's just some biological trigger I'm missing that's causing all this, but it's too obscure for me to grasp.\n\n\nIf you have any ideas or things that jump out at you, please let me know! This disease has stolen almost half my time on earth now, and will continue stealing more until it is solved. There are a lot of bright minds here, perhaps one of you can spot something. Thanks.",

This is, unfortunately, all too often the case.\n\nThe problem is that everyone responds differently to anti-depressant medications, as you have seen. Furthermore, it often takes SEVERAL WEEKS to just get up to a therapeutic level of drugs in your system. Some people require several different medications at the same time.\n\nA lot of times, doctors when prescribing these drugs also start you off on a low dose with the plan to increase the dose slowly over several weeks/months. But then patients like yourself will get frustrated by a perceived lack of improvement and stop the medication before the doctors even get a chance to do the dose increase. \n\nThe fact that you had some improvement with the nortriptyline (an older anti-depression medication) seems to suggest that you DO respond to these meds, you just need to stick with them for longer and probably with higher doses.",

Exercise helps mild/moderate depression, but has limited benefit in severe illness. If you can, then do it, but honestly I think you should prioritize basic things like showering and brushing your teeth regularly, and trying to get outside the house each day (even just for 5-10 minutes) if you're not doing that. It won't feel as good as it normally would, but it's important to do those things in order to start to get better.\n\nGiven your weight loss, you need to be seen by a family doctor if you can (within two weeks ideally) to make sure you're physically okay. Some medical problems like  thyroid issues can cause these symptoms.\n\nI also strongly recommend seeing a psychiatrist if that's available to you. They will hopefully offer you a combination of a medication, as well as therapy (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Depression if it's available) in this case\n\nIf thinking of acting on suicidal thoughts, get to an emergency room immediately.",

I recommend asking your psychiatrist if they would order a genetic panel that can help predict your response to different psychiatric medications. Many of the genes which code for enzymes that metabolize these meds vary from individual to individual. The panel can help predict the likelihood of experiencing side effects, which meds to avoid, which you are likely to respond well to, and if you might require a higher or lower dose. Please don’t give up. It can be so disheartening to try something for a month and be disappointed. I’m confident that there’s a treatment out there for you, we just haven’t nailed it yet <3",

        "body": "I am really sorry for what you have been experiencing the past 9 years. I think it would be helpful to include some of the information in your past posts, such as being on antipsychotics (paliperidone monthly, if I am correct, are you on any other medications still like antidepressants?), past diagnoses such as schizophrenia / schizoaffective disorder, OCD, and your past hospitalisation and ECT. I only say this because it might help you get more helpful answers. \n\nI have read some of your past posts (but not all) - I wonder what your symptoms were for which you were diagnosed with psychosis and how you feel the medication has affected you, and how you feel about the diagnosis. What were your symptoms of the psychosis? (You mentioned this was in the context of the benzo overdose, I am wondering why you ended up overdosing at the time for relief). Have you ever taken recreational drugs? \n\nAnhedonia like you describe may be related to certain medications, but I believe you describe it happening before that. ECT can affect memory and cognition as well, was it once that had this done (but I believe you also had symptoms prior to this). \n\nSchizophrenia can occur with negative symptoms such as some of yours (anhedonia, being withdrawn, difficulty with motivation), which can be more difficult to treat than positive symptoms and can happen before the positive symptoms. It also happens, though rarely, that people end up having another condition. I do wonder about OCD symptoms with your posts about worries about your body and health. (People can of course have more than one condition, which it sounds like your doctors think is the case). \n\nDo you have a good general doctor and psychiatrist that you see? Have you seen them recently? Do you feel you can talk to them? Have you seen a therapist other than briefly someone from church (I wouldn’t feel they would have much training related to your concerns). \n\nYou also describe traumas in childhood (though it seems you feel they weren’t that bad - you did describe a lot of yelling and difficulties at home, being pushed into a career you did not want and feel you could do, feeling shamed). If it is possible for you I would seek out a good therapist (psychologist) and support group of others with similar symptoms. In Scandinavia (I believe) psychotherapy (as well as talking in a group in front of the patient about them) is considered an integral part of treatment of schizophrenia. For OCD also, I believe this may be more difficult to treat only with medications. I also wonder if you are spending time with friends and family, exercising, getting good nutrition etc and seeing a doctor for the possible side effects on your metabolism/ sugars / cholesterol etc. (I believe you did say you were doing these things, or trying to, but with not much help). \n\nYou mentioned the possibility of long COVID, it is possible that it is playing a part if some of your symptoms worsened after. Have you spoken to your doctor about this? I am wondering this because of the loss of sense of smell. Have you ever seen a neurologist? \n\nYou also mentioned some digestive symptoms which may well be related to anxiety and depression, however I wonder if your  gastroenterologist has tested you for celiac disease. There is a link between celiac disease as well as non celiac gluten sensitivity, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms, even schizophrenia. I am also concerned given that most people gain weight rather than lose weight on antipsychotics. What tests did your gastroenterologist do, what are your typical meals like?",

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

    "body": "**FROM DEATH’S DOOR TO HEALING: My Secret Weapon and Advice One Year Later**\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFirst off, many of you have already read this so I am going to include some updates real quick before the main article.\n\nIt's winter now and I think it's fair to say that for many of us, we spiral out of control in the winter. I believe this is mainly due to the darkness and here in the states, Daylight Savings Time messing with our circadian rhythms.\n\nMy advice on this one is DO NOT STAY UP LATE, wake up earlier, and buy a happy light. I always went to bed at like 3 or 4 am and woke up late and come Daylight Savings Time, it was always a disaster. But I started going to bed by midnight, waking up at 9, and when I wake up, I go sit in the window where the sunlight is with a happy light 10 inches from my face for about an hour. And if the sun is out, I take off my shirt and get direct sunlight. This changed everything for me. Also, get the free app called f.lux to control the blue light on your screens. It gradually removes blue light the later it gets and this helps control this issue of circadian rhythm.\n\nThe other issue I discovered lately had to do with the pomegranate juice and the berries I suggested. I have to monitor the pom juice, but ESPECIALLY the berries. I still have some every day, but in more moderation. I found that eating too many blueberries in particular has been taking me out. No more than a small handful a day in the salad.\n\nAlso, the coconut milk. You can't let it stay in your fridge for more than a few days or it will grow histamine.\n\nAnyway, here's the main article:\n\nSix months ago, I was on the brink of taking my own life because of this disease. My skin burned and itched and tickled like fire ants were crawling all over me, biting me constantly. I thought I would never sleep again, and I feared I was losing my mind. Nothing I tried was working. But now, I'm stable. I'm healing. And I’m ready to share what I’ve learned to help others who are suffering from this horrendous condition.\n\nAfter battling MCAD for a year, here are a few key takeaways. First, most doctors, even specialists, know shockingly little about the root cause of this disease. Far too many of them are DANGEROUSLY IGNORANT and also ARROGANT when it comes to this topic. In my case, and I stress IN MY CASE, it all came down to leaky gut—a breakdown in the intestinal lining that lets food particles pass into the bloodstream, where the immune system attacks them. You might have something else, like SIBO. But for leaky gut, to heal, you need to understand histamine, histamine liberators, oxalates, sugars, gluten, casein, and lectins. But, if you cut out all those foods, plus do Low FODMAP and low salicylate, you’re left with basically nothing except water and that's a death sentence. The stress of trying to navigate the endless contradictions on the internet was only making the disease worse. I was lost.\n\nBut then I realized something. I realized that, overall, the greatest tool to navigate it all, better than doctors, better than websites or reddit, was ChatGPT. I started using it to track every food, supplement, and medication I was on, and it gave me way better advice than any other source. I asked it to categorize foods by histamine levels, gut health impact, and other factors, and the results were eye-opening.\n\nFor example, I was reacting to apples and told ChatGPT. ChatGPT suggested peeling them. Removing the skin completely. That worked. Now I can eat apples. It’s not perfect, but it’s light years ahead of the brambles of contradictions out there. You just have to be thorough—explain everything and challenge any advice that seems off. Ask it to make sorted lists of things by most to least beneficial or dangerous under those parameters I mentioned earlier. \n\nJust say to ChatGPT “I have leaky gut and histamine intolerance or MCAD. Here are the foods and supplements and drugs I am on. Tell me about each one when it comes to histamine, histamine liberation, oxalates, lectins, gut inflammation, sugar, casein, and gluten. Make me a list of best to worst. Is this good or is this bad? What should I remove, what should I add? How much of this should I be taking? When should I take it?” and so forth. Tell it everything and ask a lot of questions. It’s way better than the websites. \n\n**Here's an example:**\n\nMe: \"ChatGPT. I have leaky gut and MCAD. In terms of histamine, histamine liberation, lectins, oxalates, casein, sugar, and overall gut inflammation, which is worse for me you think? Tortilla chips made with yellow corn, canola oil, and salt, or shredded mozzarella cheese in a bag?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Between shredded mozzarella cheese and tortilla chips made with yellow corn, here’s a comparative analysis based on your conditions (leaky gut and MCAD):\n\n# Shredded Mozzarella Cheese\n\n* **Histamine**: Cheese, especially aged varieties, can be high in histamine. Even shredded mozzarella can contain moderate levels due to the dairy fermentation process.\n* **Histamine Liberators**: Dairy is a known liberator of histamine, which may provoke symptoms in sensitive individuals.\n* **Lectins**: Cheese does not contain lectins.\n* **Oxalates**: Dairy products are low in oxalates, but some cheeses may have moderate levels.\n* **Casein**: Contains casein, which can be inflammatory for those with dairy sensitivities.\n* **Sugar**: Generally low in sugar.\n* **Gut Inflammation**: Dairy can contribute to gut inflammation in sensitive individuals, especially in those with leaky gut.\n\n# Tortilla Chips (Yellow Corn)\n\n* **Histamine**: Generally low in histamine.\n* **Histamine Liberators**: Corn is not known to be a liberator.\n* **Lectins**: Contains lectins, which can be problematic for some people, particularly with leaky gut.\n* **Oxalates**: Low in oxalates.\n* **Casein**: Does not contain casein.\n* **Sugar**: Generally low in sugar.\n* **Gut Inflammation**: Corn may cause gut inflammation in some individuals, especially those sensitive to it.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**For your specific conditions:**\n\n* **Cheese** is likely worse for you due to its histamine content, potential to liberate histamine, presence of casein, and inflammatory potential for those with leaky gut.\n* **Tortilla chips** are lower in histamine and do not contain casein, making them a better option, although they may still cause issues due to lectins.\n\nIf you’re managing histamine sensitivity, it would generally be safer to limit or avoid cheese in favor of the tortilla chips, while being mindful of how your body reacts to both. As always, individual responses can vary, so monitoring your symptoms after consumption can provide further clarity.\"\n\n***BTW, if you're really suffering, don't eat EITHER of these!***\n\n**Here's another one for ChatGPT:**\n\nMe: \"I have histamine intolerance/MCAD and leaky gut. I am taking these medications: Zyrtec, montelukast, famotidine, diclofenac. I am trying to figure out if any of these are hurting my gut. Please make a list from most harmful to least and tell me why.\"\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\"Here’s a list of the medications you're taking, from most to least likely to harm your gut, along with explanations:\n\n# 1. Diclofenac (NSAID)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: High\n* **Reason**: Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause irritation to the stomach lining, increase the risk of ulcers, and exacerbate leaky gut. Long-term use of NSAIDs is known to damage the gut barrier and impair healing, which can worsen leaky gut over time.\n\n# 2. Montelukast (Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Moderate\n* **Reason**: Montelukast is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause gastrointestinal side effects like stomach pain, indigestion, or nausea. While it's not known to directly harm the gut lining, its effects on the gastrointestinal system might still aggravate symptoms for those with sensitive digestion or leaky gut.\n\n# 3. Famotidine (H2 Blocker)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Low to Moderate\n* **Reason**: Famotidine reduces stomach acid, which can relieve symptoms like acid reflux but may disrupt the natural balance of gut flora over time. Reduced acid levels might also make it harder to digest food properly, which can negatively impact gut health. However, it’s generally safer for the gut compared to NSAIDs.\n\n# 4. Zyrtec (Cetirizine, Antihistamine)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Low\n* **Reason**: Zyrtec is an antihistamine that’s considered to have minimal impact on gut health. While it can cause mild gastrointestinal side effects (such as nausea or dry mouth), it's not known to cause significant damage to the gut lining.\n\n# Summary:\n\n* **Diclofenac** is the most harmful for your gut due to its potential to irritate the stomach lining and worsen leaky gut.\n* **Montelukast** could cause gastrointestinal issues but is less harmful.\n* **Famotidine** might alter gut flora, though its impact is moderate.\n* **Zyrtec** is the least harmful, with minimal effects on the gut.\n\nIf you're concerned about how these medications affect your gut, it might be worth discussing alternatives with your doctor, especially for diclofenac.\"\n\nI stopped taking Diclofenac because of this and that's a big part of how I began healing.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you shouldn't look at any websites ever, or Reddit, or go to a doctor, but just know that if you do that, you will likely enter a very confusing maze of truth mixed with contradictions, ignorance, and overwhelming information. You can learn a lot that way, but you can also just become instantly lost. Try incorporating ChatGPT to help out.\n\nThe secret to using ChatGPT correctly is to KEEP IT FOCUSED. If you ask \"Make me a low histamine recipe,\" it will possibly make mistakes like telling you to use lemon juice, avocado, or banana. But if you say \"Analyze these specific foods in terms of histamine, histamine liberation, lectins, oxalates, and gut inflammation,\" it generally becomes INCREDIBLY accurate and useful.\n\n# My Healing Process\n\nI was given antibiotics that destroyed my gut biome, and I took diclofenac, which put literal holes in my intestines. I didn’t realize these things were part of the problem. ChatGPT helped me figure that out, and from there, I could work on rebuilding.\n\nI will state that I don't do low salicylate or low FODMAP along with my diets. If I did, like I said, there would only be water left. If you are doing those, tell ChatGPT.\n\nNow, here’s what worked for me, and while everyone’s different, maybe this will help you, too.\n\n# Drugs\n\nWhat I take before bed:\n\n* Zyrtec (Aller-Tec from Amazon or Costco, 365 pills for 20 bucks) (4)\n* Famotidine (2)\n* Montelukast (1) (this one you do need a prescription for)\n* Quercetin with Bromelain (I'm so unsure about this one; if it is good or bad or does nothing at all)\n* Viagra (Sildenafil) No seriously, this one opens the blood vessels and prevents histamine from pooling in certain parts of the body like my hands and head and causing them to burn and itch. When I was at my worst, the pooling was my number one problem. If you have this problem, go to your doctor and ask for sildenafil, the generic for Viagra, which unlike Viagra, is incredibly inexpensive.\n\nI was on Xolair, but it didn’t help me. If it works for you, great, but don’t believe doctors who say Xolair is the “end of the line.” It’s about healing the gut, and doctors just don’t seem to get that in the slightest. I went to three specialists, and all they offered were antihistamines and “avoid tomatoes.” When I asked them about the connection between my gut and the reactions, they looked at me like I was talking about the Loch Ness Monster coming out of my bathtub.\n\n# Supplements\n\nHere's the deal on supplements. **Don't use multivitamins.** Do one thing at a time. And read the ingredients before you buy them. Most vitamin C for example is hard on the gut and is high in histamine and a histamine liberator. And even if you find one that isn't, they will often have extra ingredients like \"citrus bioflavonoids\" or rose hips or sunflower oil or something. Those are also histamine liberators. You have to work to eliminate any little thing that might cause a reaction.\n\nHere’s what worked for me. Remember, introduce supplements ***ONE AT A TIME***\\*\\*.\\*\\* And take them 10-15 minutes before the meal (except for the probiotic, take after as it could be broken down by the betaine HCl). Also, don't buy all of these all at once. Buy the first phase and then work on that for a few weeks and then move on to the next phase.\n\n1. **NatraDAO DAO** (blue box)\n2. **Pure Encapsulations Digestive Enzymes Ultra with Betaine HCl** (if your gut is really hurting, it might be best to start with the one without Betaine HCl and then move up like a month later. I think this supplement is extremely important.)\n3. **Allergy Research Group Magnesium Ascorbate (plain version)** (a safe form of **vitamin C** without histamine-liberating ingredients like rose hip or citrus bioflavonoids)\n4. **Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Glycinate**\n5. **Pure Encapsulations Calcium Citrate** (to break down oxalates. Take this one with anything higher oxalate like the sweet potato chips I'll mention in a moment.)\n\nThese next two could take time to add, but they’re crucial:\n\n* **Zinc L-Carnosine**\n* **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**, **B2 (Riboflavin)**, and **Copper**\n\nFor this next phase, take your time, and monitor your body's reaction to determine if these are worth it for you right now:\n\n* **PE L-Glutamine (switch to powder form after you build up, something like Naked brand)** (slowly build up from say .5 to 5–10 g daily, taking some on an empty stomach. Although be careful. When I got to 10 grams I started negatively reacting to it and went back to 5 where I still currently am. Everyone is going to be different with this. Ideally you should apparently be taking even higher doses like 20 or 30 or 40 grams, but many of us might not be able to handle that. I kind of use it for a few weeks and then don't for a few. My safe spot is now between 0 and 5 grams.)\n* **Seeking Health ProBiota HistaminX** (Build up to two but I wouldn't go beyond that for a while if you are really struggling overall. I'm still trying to figure this one out. Sometimes I take it, sometimes I don't.)\n\n# Food and Drink\n\nAs far as this stuff goes, if you are REALLY struggling, like you think you might go insane or die, do a reset, **TAKE AWAY ALL YOUR FOOD** and start here.\n\n* **Water** is your best friend. I prefer sparkling water, and no, the carbon dioxide won’t hurt your gut. Stomach acid converts it back to gas and it leaves via your esophagus. I have a SodaStream. I don't use flavorings.\n* **Coconut milk** (hopefully you can find one WITHOUT additives like B12, a possible histamine liberator). I drink Real Coco. **Do NOT let it remain opened in your fridge for more than a few days or it will mess you up!**\n* **Straight Rooibos Tea** (no additional ingredients besides perhaps grated fresh ginger. This tea is a mast cell stabilizer. I drink it with every meal.)\n* **Whatever you do, DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL!**\n* If you are REALLY craving alcohol, like at a party, use **kava from a tincture** in its place.\n* **Don't smoke.** Quit, using nicotine replacement therapy. If you are having cravings, use **nicotine gum** in place of smoking, like at a party or on a trip.\n\nWe'll talk about each of these section as a Phase. Each Phase will likely take several months before adding in the food from the next one.\n\n**PHASE ONE:**\n\nStart simple:\n\n* **White rice** (NON-ENRICHED, the one WITHOUT added vitamins like b12)\n* **Rice noodles** are also a fantastic starch.\n* **Ghee** is amazing for gut health—LOTS of it, especially the refrigerated grass-fed kind. Put it on the rice, the rice noodles, zucchini, veggies, meat, put it on everything.\n* **Zucchini** (But don't let it or any other food cook to the point that it has color or char. At least not for awhile. That makes histamine.\n* **Sea Salt** is a good tool to have. Maybe use the kind WITHOUT iodine, as it may be a histamine liberator for some. Although some people might NEED the iodine.\n\nSlowly add:\n\n* **Asparagus, squash, pumpkin, bok choy, and arugula.**\n* **Gluten-free oatmeal** (Bob's Red Mill)\n* **Fresh herbs** like rosemary, thyme, basil, and tarragon. No marjoram. Double-check each one with ChatGPT.\n\nAnd while leftovers are generally dangerous as they are higher in histamine, leftover cooked veggies seem to take longer for that to happen. You should be okay to eat them for a few days.\n\n**PHASE TWO:**\n\nAdd in gradually:\n\n* **Coconut Oil** (Good, but ghee is probably better. Use sparingly.)\n* **Avocado Oil** works well too.\n* **Fresh-frozen lamb** (I recommend **Wild Fork’s lamb stew meat** from their website) For this one, start with one small chunk, and the next day try two and so forth. I can still only eat like 6 or 7 pieces a day but it's a LOT better than nothing. **MEAT MUST BE FRESH-FROZEN, NEVER THAWED, NOT FROM THE GROCERY STORE. AND NO LEFTOVERS ON MEAT. If it's thawed, it will grow histamine.**\n* **Broccoli, cauliflower, red cabbage, and Brussels sprouts** (These never bothered me, but they do have sulfur so don't overdo it.)\n* **Lesser Evil Brand Paleo Puffs** (straight Himalayan Pink Salt variety made with cassava (THIS ONE IS INCREDIBLE!)\n\nFor salads:\n\n* **Arugula, fresh herbs** (rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, tarragon, etc), olive oil, and a blend of blueberries, blackberries, and pomegranate juice. **(Be very moderate with the berries and pom. Don't eat more than a few berries a day. I made the mistake of starting to eat entire cartons of them and had reactions).** Also, as you cut your vegetables, combine some of each in tupperware and put this mix on your salad. That way, you are also getting some of the uncooked versions with their microbes into your gut. \n* **About pomegranate juice** \\- Pomegranate juice serves as a substitute for vinegar and salad dressing, ESPECIALLY when combined with the berries. Use POM Wonderful. Just make sure it's JUST the straight pomegranate juice version, not a mixture of two juices. You can also make pickles this way. Pomegranate juice with a lot of salt, and a small amount of **fresh** dill *(warning, this may be a liberator so you might want to forego the dill for a while!)* Soak sliced cucumber in it overnight in the fridge. But here's a **WARNING: buy the smallest container of the juice and use it within just a few days. If you get a big one and let it sit for weeks at a time, it will grow histamine. Also, don't overdo the pom juice. And monitor your body for reactions to it.**\n\n**PHASE THREE:**\n\n* **Jackson’s avocado oil (or coconut oil) Sweet Potato Chips (wavy is way better)** (mix with the calcium to handle oxalates). The sweet potato chips are great, but don't overdo them. And yes, even though avocados are an issue, the oil is fine. This stuff is all on Amazon (hopefully.)\n* **Apples (peeled)** (don't eat more than one a day because of sugar content)\n* These snacks will save you from going insane!\n\n**PHASE FOUR:**\n\n* **Fresh frozen chicken** (I buy the Wild Fork cubes from their website) This one I can eat less of than the lamb. Two cubes a day tops for me. Again, **MEAT MUST BE FRESH-FROZEN, NEVER THAWED, NOT FROM THE GROCERY STORE. AND NO LEFTOVERS ON MEAT. If it's thawed, it will grow histamine.**\n* **Brown rice-based gluten free pasta** (Hooray!)\n* **Sweet potatoes** (PEELED. NEVER eat the peel, and combine with calcium to break down oxalates)\n* **Carrot**\n* **Unsweetened, natural, dried coconut chips**\n\n**BAKING:**\n\nAt some point, you should be able to go to the store and buy **GLUTEN FREE BREAD,** the bread that has the least iffy ingredients. Let's see what I'm eating currently.\n\n\"Canyon Bakehouse Gluten Free Country White.\"\n\nIngredients: Water, brown rice flour, tapioca, whole grain sorghum flour, cane sugar, potato starch, whole grain oat flour, expeller pressed canola oil, xanthan gum, and 2 percent or less of egg whites, yeast, sea salt, vinegar.\n\nNow this has some stuff that if you are really struggling might be too much. Eggs and yeast and vinegar. But they are in such small amounts here. I'm tolerating eating two slices quite well currently. I use them to make a **sandwich.** Ghee on toast with rice noodles, lamb and chicken, vegetables like zucchini, arugula, and sesame oil. DELICIOUS!\n\nBut if you CAN'T tolerate this, you'll need to make your own bread.\n\nTo make **BREAD,** you will need these things:\n\n* **Cassava Flour**\n* **White Rice Flour**\n* **Arrowroot Flour**\n* **Sorghum Flour**\n* **Potato Starch**\n\nTell ChatGPT your situation, tell it you have these ingredients and ask for a safe recipe using them.\n\n**PHASE FIVE:**\n\nFor starters, up the **DIGESTIVE ENZYMES WITH BETAINE HCL.** Slowly try to get to where you are taking two with **EVERY MEAL.** Back off if you get nauseous.  \nThen, start trying these things:\n\n* **Egg yolk** (1 to start).\n* **Cinnamon** (seems to be fine)\n* And if you simply must have dessert beyond an apple, try making **rice pudding,** but instead of using regular sugar, always use **monk fruit sweetener with allulose.**\n* And for something with more weight, try **tempura veggies** using rice flour, potato starch, egg yolk and cooked in corn oil. So far, this one hasn't bothered me, but I probably wouldn't do it every day.\n* Small amounts of **garlic, pepper, onion powder.**\n* **Cauliflower Soup**\n* **Pistachios**\n* **Macadamia Nuts**\n* **Turkish Macadamia Butter**\n* **Unsulphured Dried Mangos**\n* **Occasional A2 Milk** (drink a small amount with the sweet potato chips to break down oxalates)\n* **Occasional organic grass-fed butter**.\n* **Rice Chex and regular Cheerios** (These have a small amount of things like molasses that may be triggering so don't overdo it)\n* **Sesame Oil** (Hooray!)\n* **One single corn tortilla** (preferably the rare, refrigerated kind that doesn't have a bunch of other weird ingredients, but any corn one might be okay.) You can use this to put rice, veggies, some sesame oil, arugula, and meat into to make a **taco.** \n* **Start microdosing.** A Pringle. A bite of casserole. Just one per day, and no not one bite of something you know it going to definitely mess you up like tomatoes or spinach. This may or may not be worth it.\n* When you are having a meal with a more advanced thing like dairy or corn or the meat, that's the meal that you should use the most Digestive Enzymes Ultra with Betaine HCl on.\n\nAt this point, you might hit kind of a wall where your histamine bucket overflows. You'll have to really work with ChatGPT and figure out which of the things you recently added is doing it. You might have to slow down or backtrack. It's also why you want to add each one of these gradually, one at a time. Don't have multiple question marks happening at the same time. Just one. Try one, wait several days, then try another. Same thing with supplements. **Do NOT add more than one thing at a time.**\n\nAt this point, I would recommend something that might sound strange.\n\n**Stop taking most of your supplements.** Not the DAO and not the Digestive Enzymes, but everything else. For a week. See how your body likes it. And from then on experiment with taking time off from them. A week, a month, and then back.\n\nIf you have gotten this far, try **vitamin B6 in the form of P-5-P,** although this one might cause reactions. See if you can get one that isn't like \"20 thousand percent daily value,\" but much lower. And for **vitamin b12**, try methylcobalamin.\n\nThis process took me at least six months, but it was worth it. I went from barely eating anything to now having enough variety in my diet that I'm no longer going insane. But the most important thing is that I’m **sleeping through the night again.** The scariest part of this disease is when it starts to look like you'll never be able to sleep again.\n\nDrink **LOTS of water** throughout the day to rid the body of histamine via urination.\n\nEat slowly and chew your food well!\n\nGet lots of sleep. And if you're REALLY struggling, don't exercise much, as it releases histamine. When you start healing, then start adding in exercise.\n\nAnother thing I’d recommend is to ditch any perfumes, colognes, incense and such or at least pay attention to them as they might be liberators. \n\nI CANNOT STRESS THIS NEXT ONE ENOUGH: If you are having serious skin issues like itching, **TAKE A SHOWER RIGHT BEFORE BED!** (not just in the morning, also not too hot) and then put lotion all over yourself immediately when you get out. This helps a lot.\n\nIf your scalp burns and itches, use **Jamaican Mango and Lime No More Itch Gro Spray (mentholated).** Soak it in the stuff and if it's really bad, put a shower cap over that and keep it on in bed. I used to have to sleep that way, but it saved my life. The stuff really helps a lot.\n\nMy hands were really bad too at night. **Cortisone cream** for this one. And try adding **Sarna** to it too. If your scalp is too much for even the spray, put this stuff on your head as well. Maybe everywhere. If all else fails, for itching, use cortisone cream.\n\n# Leaky Gut\n\nAlso, I think one of the most important things I did on my road to healing, and I also can't stress this enough, was watch the documentary **“Hack Your Health: Secrets to Your Gut”** on Netflix. I found that it really helped me understand how this all works, why I developed this disease in the first place, and what to do about it. Understanding more about the gut micro biome is extremely important to healing. Please, for the love of God, watch that one.\n\n# One Last Piece of Advice\n\nIt’s scientifically proven that trauma and stress are literally stored in the body and can manifest as physical diseases, especially autoimmune disorders and gut issues. If you have trauma, it's time to deal with it. Go to therapy. Meditate. Try reiki. Work with a shaman. Listen to solar plexus chakra healing frequencies on YouTube. Study PTSD. Read **The Body Keeps the Score** by Bessel van der Kolk. That one brings it all into crystal clear focus.\n\nI have CPTSD. I wasn’t facing it. I thought if I could just ignore it, I would be okay. But it doesn't work like that. When I reached my lowest point with the histamine disease, it became clear that I had to start healing emotionally in order to heal physically. The moment I began addressing my trauma, my histamine disease started to improve. I think this is a huge part of understanding how to heal from this illness.\n\nTake care of your gut. Address your mental health. Use ChatGPT. And don’t give up.\n\nAlso, if you have any suggestions about how I could personally go further in my own healing or make this better, please let me know.\n\nGood luck to all of you on this journey. You’re not alone.",

        "body": "I love ChatGPT as a health tool.

        "body": "Oh my Thank you for posting this explanation and your journey. I'm 41 and never experienced anything as severe as this.  I knew I reacted to certain things like fermented foods, MSG, citrus, alcohol, bananas, tomatoes, avocados, etc so i avoided them mostly. I've been searching for answers the last 5 months after going to the ER for sudden anafalaxsis, abnormal sinus tachycardia, flushing, blood pressure drops, numbness & tingling of arms face & chest...was \"observed & released\" twice before finally admitted to the neurology wing where I stayed 3 days hooked to monitors and sent home with a 30 day holter moniter. I was told at the 3rd ER visit to not come back but learn how to manage these episodes on my own and \"rebuild my life brick by brick.\" That was May 1, 2024. Labs CT & ECHO were normal except for sodium and potasium too low. They couldn't account for what was going on but agreed I had physical symptoms of something. At first psychiatric was called because they wrote me off as anxiety/panic attack until abnormal sinus tachycardia was recorded and crash cart called one of the nights of my observation.  My ears were ringing day/night and got worse with the episodes or when I became overloaded. (I've since used my tinnitus as a sign I'm overdoing it or about to experience histamine dump.) I was given dicyclomine & tranzodone & buspar in the ER and it literally says on the bottle of tranzodone not to mix meds like buspar. I have apnea and was using my cpap but the nurses were waking me up because my blood pressure was 82/58 and dropping at night.   When I would have the flushing episodes and stand up, I would go to 148/90 and I would get dizzy with heartrate jumping to 135bpm. I tried taking the buspar and even 5mg made me so dizzy I couldn't walk.\n\n\nThe following month back home was terrible, feeling like I was going to die from my throat closing up, suddenly being allergic to everything I put in my mouth, the blood pressure drops jarring me awake every few hours at night, the stinging, burning & flushing of my skin...my friends and family hopeless to help and i didnt even know what to ask for except to not be alone in case I finally had a major episode and crashed. The panic this caused was terrifying as well but i did my best to keep cool and not succum to it. The 4th ER Dr gave me klonopin which helped the panic. I ended up taking benadryl (and stopped the trazodone) because of the food reactions and I felt like this was more of an allergy/histamine response. I started taking 25mg every 4 hours and stacking another 25mg if things got really bad. That was the only thing that helped me through the pain and episodes. At least took the edge off.  9 days after the last ER visit, I found a PCP who ordered me an epi pen just in case (thank the gods) and put me on omneprezole & Allegra, referred me to an allergist. The allergist ran every test and said I was fine and not allergic to anything, that it was nothing histamine related because histamine only lasts 15 minutes in the body before it gets absorbed and flushed out  (refused to give me the qualitative urine test even after I asked twice for it and my PCP couldn't order.) She said it was POTS and to see a cardiologist & neurologist. \n\n\nI went BACK to the allergist 2 weeks later  and told her I know something isn't right and I need H1/H2 blockers the the urine test. The urine test was within normal ranges so she advised zyrtec 10mg daily and famotidone 20mg twice daily, stopping the omneprezole & allegra.  These helped after the first week I noticed a little more relief in the histamine responses but nothing GI. I asked her about DAO enzymes & infections that would wipe it out, she referred me to GI because my guts were absolutely wretched. Yellow Diarreah and passing food without digesting, running to the bathroom after eating anything, bladder spasms, etc.  This was the first clue to me that something could be off in my gut flora...an infection or something and I started reading about enzymes (DAO, etc.) The only thing I could tolerate were organic apples, organic blueberries & plain white quinoa. 3 foods sustained me for 2 weeks. I couldn't add salt or olive oil without reacting and setting my whole nervous & digestive system into a tail-spin. Ghee helped but only tiny amounts at first. My mom came in from out of state to help me figure out how to eat again and do research, make lists, etc. While I was waiting on to hear lab results and to see specialists.  I was also tasting & smelling a chemical taste like hand sanitizer with the episodes. I still get that chemical sensation if I wait too long to eat or get jump scared. \n\n\nI have 4 kids and single parenting (my 2 youngest are on the spectrum) and I was reacting to stimulus like their yelling or outbursts...I couldn't even drive...even around the corner to their school. I wore wireless headphones and listened to zen music and tones on YouTube just to stay as calm as I could and stop the episodes. I was given hydroxyzine 50mg and klonopin .5mg up to 3x/day to help with the reactions. I found reddit posts on HiT & dysautonomia and started reading and trying to learn. My partner thought it was PTSD and honestly a lot of the symptoms sounded similar but the only thing that settled things down was low histamine diet...low heat cooking foods and immediately freezing them in portions to reheat at mealtime. I stopped eating at 6/6:30pm to see if it helped with the 10pm histamine dumps I experienced nightly and it did. I also read about MCAS and immune dysfunction. I had burning headaches immediately after eating, and pain in my lymph nodes down my neck and in my armpits.",

    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

    "body": "Hello! So 2020 was the year I finally really got into skincare, and especially AB skincare. My skin type is oily-combination and I mostly struggle with dehydration and CCs. I live in a tropical country, so it’s summer and hot/humid all year long, so most of the products I used were lightweight and focused on hydration and soothing. This review will be (almost) all of the skincare I tried this year, hopefully it is informative enough and can be beneficial!\n\n\n\n**PURITO** ***Defence Barrier pH Cleanser***: Gel cleanser with a pH of 5.5, contains tea tree (you can kind of smell it), centella and royal jelly. It’s a viscous, slightly runny thick clear gel that lathers but does not foam. I don’t know why though this broke me out :( My skin did not feel tight at all, but I think it does not cleanse enough so instead left a stubborn trail off CCs along my cheek, and after months I am still trying to heal from it. Heard really good things about it but maybe not for me :( **2/5 WNRP**\n\n**Hada Labo** ***Tamagohada AHA+BHA Mild Exfoliating Face Wash***: Tried this in an attempt to help my CCs since I can’t find other SA face washes where I live. Thick, white paste that lathers and does not foam that much. Honestly don’t think it exfoliates at all since it’s wash off, and the packaging indicates there is only 0.98% AHA (glycolic acid), and the BHA (salicylic acid) is even lower in the ingredients list. It’s a bit stripping, and although it did not break me out, it did not do anything either. **2/5 WNRP**\n\n**Senka** ***Perfect Whip Facial Cleansing Foam***: This was the cleanser I used before going into skincare. I heard it has high pH, and even though my face never felt tight it does always make that squeaky sound after cleansing if you rub your hands on your face? Haha. This foams a lot and the foam does keep up for a long time. Definitely does not recommend for sensitive skin, as it could be overly stripping, but since it does not break me out, I will have to keep using it until I find a better cleanser. **2.5/5 WRP**\n\n**COSRX** ***One Step Original Clear Pad***: This was first exfoliating pad. It contains willowbark water (a form of BHA), tea tree and betaine salicylate. The pads are textured with slightly raised dots so it physically exfoliates as well. It contains 70 sheets so sometimes I stick a few around my face and leave them like a sheet mask. It definitely helped a bit with managing breakouts and a bit on skin texture, though there is no huge difference as it is very mild chemical exfoliation. Definitely thankful I started chemical exfoliation with this as it is very gentle, but now I think I’d use a slightly stronger one. **4/5 WNRP**\n\n**Wishtrend** ***Mandelic Acid 5% Skin Prep Water***: This was my first sole AHA. It’s a runny and watery, has a slight like medicine smell. It contains centella, hottuynia cordata, licorice root extract, beta glucan, panthenol, and sodium hyaluronate in addition to the AHA, which I honestly feel more benefits from than the exfoliation itself haha. It is very hydrating, but from an exfoliation standpoint I think it is quite too mild (probably because the mandelic acid molecules are larger relative to other AHAs) so it did not seem to do much. **3.5/5 WNRP**\n\n**Benton** ***Snail Bee High Content Essence***: A thick, clear essence that looks more like a serum but it applies like water. This contains snail mucin, bee venom, willowbark extract, and a couple other plant extracts, and it has no scent. I had really high hopes since I saw many reviews saying the product tremendously helped their breakouts but aside from hydrating a bit it did not really do anything on my face. **3/5 WNRP**\n\n**COSRX** ***Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence***: The super hyped super popular essence with 96% snail mucin. This is the most hydrating product I’ve ever used, has a clear, slimy (sorry;-;) texture but once you apply it, the slimy feeling goes away. I think I have to go against the crowd here, honestly this product leaves like a oily(?) film for a long time and does not sink in well. Initially cleared some CCs on my forehead and had really positive results, though after three months of constant use, it broke me out on my cheeks, which is a huge pity. I will mourn for this forever. **3/5 WNRP**\n\n**PURITO** ***Centella Green Level Buffet Serum***: Accidentally bought the scented instead of the unscented but it was okay. This has a gel consistency similar to the Benton essence, contains 49% centella extract, peptides, niacinamide, green tea extract, panthenol and ceramides. It does not do anything to breakouts but is very hydrating and is incredible in relieving redness and soothing irritations. **4/5 MRP**\n\n**Dr Ceuracle** ***Royal Vita 33 Propolis Ampoule***: Okay for a broke student like me, this definitely broke the bank considering the tiny 15ml bottle that barely lasted over two months even when I use just a drop or two every day. It’s definitely a very concentrated, viscous ampoule, and it has a slight sweet scent, like honey. I think I put my expectations too high here reading the reviews haha- it’s definitely not a cure-all and did not help with acne/CCs. Though given the small amount I used, it was incredibly hydrating and I could see the “propolis glow” mentioned constantly, I was so scared my face would fall into a dehydrated, dull mess after I stopped using it. But honestly after months of not using it anymore, I don’t think it’s worth repurchasing if you’re short on budget like me🥲 **4/5 MRP**\n\n**Somethinc** ***AHA BHA PHA Peeling Solution***: Okay so this is a local brand from Indonesia, but they ship worldwide so I am including it here. So this is very similar to the TO AHA BHA solution, both also has the daucus carota sativa extract to make them red, but this one has a far lower percentage and therefore is more gentle. It contains 3% AHA, 1% BHA and 2% PHA, and is far more runny than the one from TO. Although it is advised to be used once a week and washed off, since it’s mild, I am able to use it 1x/3 days without washing it off. This + the dokdo lotion were game changers this year, cleared up a huge lot of my stubborn CCs without compromising my skin barrier at all. **5/5 WRP**\n\n**Round Lab** ***1025 Dokdo Lotion***: THIS. This is the dream moisturizer I do not deserve. It’s a very lightweight lotion similar to the Hada Labo Gokujyun Milk but with the sea water and more beneficial plant extracts (including centella, licorice root and chamomile) and squalane, that literally becomes water when you spread it. It sinks in quickly and is not sticky at all, is incredibly hydrating AND moisturizing (a bit more than the Soon Jung emulsion) that I don’t need to add any thicker moisturizer, and for some reason it somehow helped with skin texture issues. **10/5 oops, HG WRP**\n\n**Illiyoon** ***Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream***: A very thick cream that does not feel too heavy and sinks in relatively quickly. I bought the 200ml size and it lasts a very long time, even when I used it for both my body and face. Since my face is oily-combination, it is quite too heavy for me, so I apply this while my face is still damp with a toner. Its definitely soothing and moisturizing enough for dry skin, and I’ve heard people use this on babies, so I can easily recommend this for all skin types. **4.5/5 MRP**\n\n**KOSE** ***Suncut UV Protect Spray***: I love using spray sunscreen as it is super simple and trouble-free.   This one claims to have SPF 50+ PA++++. It does leave a slight shiny film on top of your face but is not really a huge bother as it did not break me out and will sink down after. It is transparent and does not leave any white cast, and is especially nice for touching up throughout the day, even if you are wearing make up. A con would be that its quite expensive for a 60gr bottle, and also there is a risk of not applying enough/evenly as it is sprayed. **4.5/5 MRP**\n\n**Innisfree** ***Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask 2x***: This 100ml tub honestly lasts a very long time. It’s a clay mask but it also contains AHA to help with skin texture. It has a thick but spreadable consistency and somehow feels cooling to the face when applied. I use this once every few days in a thin layer and most of the time there really were visible differences in minimizing the appearance of pores. **4/5 MRP**\n\n**Lululun** ***Facial Sheet Mask - White***: I got the pack of 7, which was a deal honestly. The sheets are thick but the face sizes are the smallest I’ve ever used. The amount of essence is moderate. It’s moisturizing so I sometimes skip my moisturizer and just use this for the night. But aside from that I did not see any brightening properties from this white version. **3/5 MRP**\n\n**Mediheal** ***Meience Sheet Masks***: The first and only mediheal masks I’ve ever gotten as the other types are quite more expensive :(, but I am hooked. The essences in these masks are very abundant, I ended up using the rest for my arms. The sheets are of different components for each of the four different masks. The morning after I used this my pores were far less visible, the texture on my face lessened a lot, and a growing pimple I had calmed down. I don’t know what sort of magic mediheal has, but I will definitely look into their other ones after this. **5/5 WRP**\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading, have a great day!",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chi00fdvc8731.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a191ba338f59eaa0c66ece19e1e3b5311c87dfa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. \\[SCINIC\\] First Treatment Essence - 4.16/5 (5,282 Reviews)**\n\n150ml/19,800 KRW\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Adenosine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Water, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b08iueb0d8731.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=163f45d2760c17dfc195db29d3e667246a7c272c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. \\[TORRIDEN\\] Dive-in Serum - 4.42/5 (1,127 Reviews)**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xantham Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract.\n\n*This looks like Hada Labo lotions tbh. :o Except with more skin soothing things like panthenol, witch hazel, madecassoside, allantoin and such.

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

    "body": "I have been doingcsome research on histamines and thought I should share my results so far. This is a work in progress but there are many potentially valuable things that might help others. If you have anything to add then please speak up and I will add that to my research and post again later. \n\nHistamine Lowering/Blocking\n\n# Blocking Histamine production\n\nHistidine decarboxylase is the enzyme that produces histamine in humans, and research[1] shows that it can be blocked to actually prevent the production of histamine. The enzymatic synthesis of human derived histamine can be blocked by two common types of natural molicules:\n\n***Eugenol*** - (CAS: 97-53-0)\nFrom Clove, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, and Basil and Bay leaf. Supplimental forms are avaliable as clove oil extract. \n\n- Reduces histamine levels: Eugenol can reduce the amount of histamine in the blood \n- Inhibits histamine release: Eugenol can prevent **mast cells** from releasing histamine. \n- Inhibits histamine-induced itch: Eugenol can reduce itching caused by histamine and atopic dermatitis. \n- Eugenol has anti-inflammatory properties.\n- Eugenol has antioxidant properties.\n- Eugenol has antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties.\n- Eugenol has been used in folk medicine for dental care, as an antiseptic, and as an analgesic.\n\n***Epicatechin Gallate***          (ECG)   (CAS: 1257-08-5)  \n***Epigallocatechin Gallate*** (EGCG)  (CAS: 989-51-5) [2]\nFrom Green Tea, buckwheat, and grapes. Supplimental forms are available as EGCg (green tea extract).\n\nInteracts with **mast cell** membranes, potentially affecting the signaling pathways involved in degranulation.\n\n- Cancer prevention: Studies suggest it may inhibit cancer cell growth and proliferation in various types of cancers. \n- Cardiovascular health: May help improve blood vessel function and lower cholesterol levels. \n- Anti-inflammatory effects: Potential to reduce inflammation in the body. \n- Weight management: Some studies suggest it may contribute to weight loss by promoting fat burning. \n- Neuroprotective effects: Research is exploring its potential role in neurodegenerative diseases due to its antioxidant activity. \nNote: high doses may cause gastrointestinal upset \n\n# Diamine Oxidaze (DAO) \nDAO is a natural enzyme that is ment to degrade the levels of histamine.  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamine_oxidase\n\n## Raising DAO Levels \n\n### Oleic Acid (CAS:112-80-1) \nOleic acid, the fatty acid of triolein, can actually ***increase serum levels of Diamine Oxidaze (DAO)***.  Olive oil is high in oleic acids, and  general purpose Oleic Acid is available on Amazon in various forms and purity.  \n\n- Take zinc, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamin B12 \n\n### blocking of DAO (Avoid List): \nalcohol, energy drinks, black tea, green tea\n\nNote:  Both ECG and EGCG will actually block the *production of histamines*, but here EGCg appears to also block *production of DAO*. More research is needed to see which is more benificial, but logically you don't even need to degrade something that does not exist. I therefor lean towards green tea extract EGCg being more benificial than not because it has many other beneficial purposes as well.  \n\n## Drugs that Inhibit DAO  Production or Processing (Avoid list) \nAmitriptyline, Cymbalta, Effexor, Prozac, Zoloft, Cardizem, Metoprolol, Norvasc, Propafenone, Dihyrdalazine, Enbrel, Humira, and Plaquenil, Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, and Indomethacin , Naproxen, Acetylcysteine, Metoclopramide\n\nEdit: Amitriptyline studies are somewhat mixed as to whether it helps or hurts. This obviously needs more research\n\n# N-methyltransferase (HNMT)  enzyme\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine_N-methyltransferase\nAn enzyme that inactivates histamine by transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to histamine. HNMT is expressed in the brain. Clinical studies suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms of the human HNMT gene are associated with several brain disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. \n\n## To increase HNMT:\n- B12\n- folate\n- S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe)\n\n## Inhibitors of HNMT (Avoid List):\n- ***Diphenhydramine***\n- Amodiaquine, Chloroquine, Dimaprit, Etoprine, Metoprine, Quinacrine, Tacrine\n\n## GUT Bacteria vs. DAO\n\n*Klebsiella aerogenes* elevates histamines. If you test positive for this strain, then perhaps consider talking to your doctor. \nhttps://www.lucymailing.com/the-gut-bacteria-that-produce-histamine-in-ibs-revealed/\n\nOther bacteria that produce histamines:\nProteus, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, Raoultella, Vibrio, Acinetobacter, Plesiomonas, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Photobacterium, Clostridium, Morganella, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella\n\n**Histamine degrading strains** - Look for probiotics containing these strains:\nLactobacillus Gasseri\nBacillus polymyxa\nLactobacillus plantarum\nVirgibacillus campisalis\n\n**DAO and Histamine burden**\nTaking DAO can help reduce your overall histamine burden, as it is an enzyme that destroys histamines coming from foods and bacteria before it can be absorbed into the bloodstream.  Those same histamines in the gut, before absorption, will cause inflammation of the intestional lining and thereby breach your immunological barrier. Your serum level production of DAO is inversely proportional to your intestional permeability, so fixing the inflammation source will often help correct your proper serum levels of DAO. \n\n# Products to consider taking \n\nDAO products by cost effectiveness \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1FJ7omUM6FPd_Patlg6xlCGaP3m1Sz0x7UeSOUit4Xuw/htmlview#gid=1795084428\n\n- Quercetin: A natural histamine 4 receptor antagonist, and may help offset the effects of bacterial histamine on mast cell accumulation in the gut and thus reduce gut hypersensitivity. \n\n- Butyrate – Suppresses mast cell activation.

So I actually think if that's the issue this is worth taking to heal it at the root cause, but you might need to be extreme in other measures to reduce histamine to allow enough room in the bucket for the histidine whle taking it.",

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

It's impossible to last without sulphates. Most CG shampoos also have milder sulphates because they're cleansing agents. Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

Not just the usual stuff — they looked at **multi-omics data**: proteins, genes, metabolites. The whole picture.\n\nWhat stood out to me?\n\nWith consistent exercise, the body doesn’t just get fitter — it actually starts **aging more slowly**.\n\n* Less inflammation\n* Fewer senescent (aging) cells\n* A boost in something called **betaine metabolism**\n\nThat last one surprised me.\n\nTurns out, betaine (a molecule we partly make in our kidneys when we move regularly) plays a big role in protecting cells from age-related decline. In mice, boosting it even reversed signs of aging.\n\nAnd here’s the wild part:  \nBetaine seems to bind to and inhibit a protein linked to aging (TBK1). That’s not just a fitness benefit — that’s a potential **longevity mechanism**.\n\nIt makes me think:  \nMaybe we’ve been underestimating just how powerful regular movement is. Not just for healthspan — but *lifespan*.\n\nLink:\n\n[https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00635-X?\\_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS009286742500635X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue](https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00635-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS009286742500635X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)",

Since then, I've experienced persistent diarrhea and abdominal bloating with excessive gas. It feels like there's an uncontrollable release of gas, and the diarrhea doesn't stop. This vicious cycle has continued until now.\n\nI'm afraid to eat because when I do, digestion issues start, and gas is released immediately. Even at the age of 26, excessive diarrhea weakened my anal sphincter, resulting in no gas passing. A colorectal surgeon has recommended surgery for me.\n\nI've made efforts to improve my condition, such as walking, drinking apple cider vinegar, taking betaine HCL, glutamine capsules, peppermint capsules, fennel seed capsules, and probiotics. I've also visited hospitals, but I haven't seen improvement. Now, I worry because gas doesn't get expelled, and there's concern it might leak.\n\nI genuinely feel like I want to die. If it weren't for my digestive issues, I could have led a normal and happy life. I've endured pain for the past 10 years and have never experienced happiness. Now, I don't see any hope of getting better. I spend every night in tears and have seriously considered death.\n\nI've heard that fecal transplant surgery is common in the United States. Are there people who have undergone this surgery? In Korea, it's not widespread yet, but if it becomes more accessible, I'm willing to consider it.\n\nPlease, I just want to get better.",

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

The texture is slightly thick and gooey(but not gross)\n\nApplication: I use 3-4 pumps for my whole face. I apply it on wet dripping face right after cleanser in the evening. On some days I layer it twice. My skin drinks it up as soon as I apply it. It spreads easily on wet skin. On dry skin it doesn't fully absorb and sits on the skin.\n\nI love it. I bought 9 bottles so far. And gifted three to my friends. You can see 4 in the photo. I gave away the old ones for recycling. I use it every day in my PM routine during winters. It helps keep my skin hydrated in dry weather. If i go a week without using it, I can feel the difference. Skin feels tight and not as glowy when i wake up. I always take it for travelling. It's helpful during flights and while staying in hotel rooms where my skin feels most dehydrated.\n\n***10/10 Will repurchase , Holy Grail!***\n\nSorry for any mistakes. This is my first review.

Please be nice.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the product, do ask.\n\nIngredient list:  Snail Secretion Filtrate, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Carbomer, Panthenol, Arginine\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kji0qunq126c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ce0d4f723574305d1432788265475e90018dca3",

    "body": " \n\n**Product**: Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid + Niacinamide Serum (bought from Cos de Baha store on Amazon)\n\n**Ingredients**: \\*Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Ext., Tranexamic Acid, Niacinamide, Glycereth-26, Betaine, Propanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid,\\*Camellia Sinensis Leaf Ext,\\*Sambucus Nigra Flower Ext,\\*Momordica Charantia Fruit Ext,\\*Leontopodium Alpinum Ext. \\*Mark: N.O.I.P 78%\n\n**Skin type**: Very dry and prone to hormonal acne (deeper pustules; reddish bumps that do not come to a head mainly below nose/chin area). Had an extreme breakout during a period of high stress in my early 30s which left my face full of PIH which are several shades darker than my skin tone and PIE. The active breakout got under control thanks to 10% benzoyl peroxide cream and mega-dosing with Vitamin B5. Current goals are to completely eliminate old existing scars and keep my skin hydrated.\n\n**Climate**: humid subtropical according to Wikipedia (I live in the DC area)\n\n**Current routine**: AM-cold water rinse, Hadolabo Gokujyun Premium lotion followed by Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum, then COSRX Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence OR Iunik Beta Glucan Power Moisture Serum followed by Vanicream daily moisturizer for sensitive skin at the end for additional moisture (If anyone has AB recs for something more hydrating/penetrating that leaves your skin feeling moisturized longer than the Vanicream feel free to let me know lol. I have been rebuying in the meantime because it actually absorbs into my skin and doesn't irritate at all instead of sitting on top and feeling itchy/stingy which is what Clinique Dramtically Different Moisturizing Lotion did). I use 10% benzoyl peroxide or Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion as a spot treatment for when I do get the occasional pimple here and there. Biore Watery Essence as my SPF. \n\nPM- B.LAB Matcha Hydrating Foam Cleanser (I do not cleanse every day but every other day or only on days I wear makeup because I'm trying to avoid stripping additional moisture from my skin), same moisturizing routine as AM\n\n**Verdict**: I have been using this product daily for 4 weeks now. First I want to say my PIH left over from my breakouts years ago are several shades darker than my skin tone and have been extremely stubborn and unresponsive to a bunch of products over the years. I tried so many treatments from lower end like Ambi cream, Palmer fade and Mederma scar gel (I was clueless and in the trenches those days lmao) to pure Licorice root extract and Lancome Visionnaire Crescendo night peel. I also tried several Vitamin C serums. To this day, the ONLY products that have noticeably faded my PIH are Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC and now.... Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum! \n\n**Review:** Now onto the review! First of all I like that packaging-wise it's in a plastic and not glass vial (like Iunik Beta Glucan) since glass can shatter in the mail or when dropped, however I would prefer a squeeze tube like Melano CC so you can ensure you get to the last drop and not leave behind any product. The dropper application unfortunately leaves product at the bottom which is pretty wasteful considering it's only a fluid ounce. Unlike Melano CC and other Vitamin C serums, the serum texture is not oily at all but more of a viscuous liquid like a moisturizing toner. I think it's best applied on wet skin after cleansing/toning or rinsing with water. I haven't detected any scent or chemical smell. It is moisturizing and absorbs well into the skin and doesn't feel like a treatment or something acidic at all.\n\nI started noticing results somewhere between 2 and 3 weeks which is incredibly fast especially  considering my skin history. I have a particularly stubborn dark spot on my left lower cheek and it has lightened several shades and shrunk to half its original size. I imagine within another week or two it'll be completely gone. There was another stubborn cluster of PIH along my left jawline that has faded to the point where I can go without concealer or foundation on top of it.  In comparison Melano CC, which was very effective for me as well, took much longer, somewhere around at least 7 or 8 weeks before I saw noticeable results. \n\n**Price**: I paid 11.99 (12.71 with tax) from Amazon for 1 fluid ounce. I bought this over a month ago, however while writing this review I checked the price again and now it's $15.49 for two fluid ounces which is a much better deal, go figure. It is kind of pricey considering the small amount of product you get but IMO very well worth it. I will be rebuying and plan on gifting this to friends who also struggle with PIH!",

I know people love raving about Tranexamic Acid and Niacinamide being amazing for PIE but after using 3 bottles up of this serum, the stubborn PIE left on my brow area doesn't really have much improvement. Sure, it looks a bit better now but that could also be because PIE fades by itself slowly overtime. Something that I love about this serum though is how soothing it is. My skin is very sensitive and whenever it's really red and burning, I find that applying this serum instantly calms my skin, probably because of the aloe. I don't like however that sometimes it goes on a bit foamy, which can happen with Niacinamide apparently, but it doesn't do that a lot. Also its so cheap, if you're looking to fade dark spots, Sun spots, age spots, and possibly help with existing PIE, spend the 12-15 dollars and see if you like it or not! :)",

    "body": "All this happened on the course of 3 years.\n\n* **CAUSES AND START OF SYMPTOMS**\n\n3 infections with COVID, poor eating habits (weird hours), poor diet (lots of fast food, soda, sugar), bad sleep schedule.\n\n* **SYMPTOMS**\n\nBad digestion (low motility), bloating, gas (burps and farts, foul smelling), nausea, dizziness, brain fog, insomnia, abdominal pain and distension, lack of appetite, weight loss, anxiety, depression, constipation (which led to anal injuries). Also Diarrhea. Also a seemingly unrelated constant upper neck (back of head) inflammation that was presumed due to poor posture but could also cause a dysfunctional vagus nerve (leading to bad motility, general bad parasympathetic function). Fainting sensation if hungry.\n\n* **DOCTOR's (WRONG) DIAGNOSES**\n\nGastritis, GERD, Crohn's or IBS due to suspicious marks inside the large intestines, stress. Pysch diagnoses: Depression and \"it's all in your head.\" Eating disorder.\n\n* **DOCTOR's (WRONG) TREATMENTS**\n\n1+ years of PPIs (this destroyed my stomach and made me very susceptible to infections), Budesonide and other remedies for IBS. OTC stomach antiacids. Psych meds: Benzodiazepine (ativan), escitalopram, rivotril, tradozone, mitrazapine, paxil, pregabalin, zopiclone.\n\n* **CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED BACTERIAL INFECTIONS**\n\nClostridium difficile (treated with vancomycin) and, after that, E-Coli (attempted to treat with a bunch of hard antibiotics that made me ill and also didn't work).\n\n* **PROCEDURES AND TESTS**\n\n4 endoscopies, 3 colonoscopies, abdominal CT scan, multiple bacteria-parasite-virus tests, microbiome test (result: big-time dysbiosis), multiple calprotectin tests (ranging from 150 to 6000), zonulin (high - indicator of Leaky Gut), low vitamin D, normal blood and thyroid values, no histamine intolerance, many IGG food intolerances (gluten, wheat, lactose, nuts, processed meats), multiple negative h-pylori. Official SIBO test was not performed because I was always on some kind of antibiotics and it could show inaccurate results.\n\n* **MY OWN (CORRECT) DIAGNOSIS**\n\nOnce ruling out everything else, I concluded I had dysbiosis and SIBO and proceeded to treat myself for it. Benzodiazepine addiction, eventually, that had to be stopped by withdrawing.\n\n* **THE SCHEDULE, DIET AND PILLS THAT CURED ME**\n\n>Mornings\n\nOn empty stomach: cup of ginger tea from root (natural biofilm disruptor), PHGG fiber, powder of artichoke, ginger, celery, apple, lemon, powders of Pro-Prabioma, Probiotic and Pro-Mucosa from TISSO, vitamin D3, Zenyth Leaky Gut powder mix, saccharomyces boulardii.\n\n>Between meals\n\nBentonite clay, activated charcoal (2 hours from any meal or pill). They're natural binders. Electrolytes or ginger nausea pills if needed.\n\n>Lunch\n\nCup of ginger tea before lunch, trimebutine and drops of Iberogast. Betaine HCL+enzymes, a mix of vegetable supplements, vitamin C, salmon oil.  Cinnamon, chromium, DGL licorice, plant aid for liver (Liv 52 - helps detox), magnesium citrate. 2 weeks of rifaximin and nystatin. Then, 3 weeks of natural antimicrobials pills: oregano oil, berberine, peppermint oil, allicin.\n\n>Evening / before bed\n \nGlycerin suppositories to help me poop if needed. Ambien 5-15mg, 0.5mg melatonin and some valerian for sleep. Activated charcoal.\n\n* **THE CORRECT DIET**\n\nNeedless to say, I had to stop all gluten, fresh dairy, processed foods, sugars, greasy foods. \n\nLiquids: 2+ liters of water, ginger tea, occasionally kefir and kombucha. Chicken broth soup with vegetables, 1-2 times a day, organic.\n\nSolids: gf bread, gf oats, gf milk, eggs, granola, gf sugar-free snacks, boiled chicken, rice, a variety of boiled or steamed veggies (kinda FODMAP but also some broccoli, potatoes and other stuff so not strict), gf pasta, white fish. Soy protein powder, no sugar.\n\nDesserts: 95% sugar-free chocolate, natural honey.\n\n* **AFTERMATH AND CONCLUSIONS**\n\nAfter 2 months of correct treatment, I'm almost back to my former self. I still take some natural antimicrobials some days, I find them to help maintain the microbiome and reduce symptoms. Charcoal is the best thing ever invented and I will probably take it forever, it's a natural antimicrobial and bloat remover, use it wisely. Doctors were mostly useless, my hospital stays were a total waste of time and money. I had to figure myself out. I will keep this diet for a long time, slowly introducing more diverse stuff in a way I feel comfortable. Now that I'm functional (maybe even healthy), I'm in no rush to go back to McDonalds or Coca Cola or other such bullshit. Lesson learned. Best of luck to everyone, and let me know if I can help you with advice.",

I kinda forgot about that, but had it too! Simply stretching my neck by tilting my head left & right sometimes helped to get a clearer head.

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Hello! So beplain initially caught my attention as I’ve heard the brand was made based on customer feedback in Korea. The ingredients list for these products are relatively simple so there was little worry for breakouts. It definitely did not disappoint!\n\nA little background: I live in a humid country with dehydrated, combination, acne-prone skin. My main concerns with my skin right now is CCs, calming and hydrating.\n\n-\n**Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam** ***4.5/5 MRP***\n\n*Glycerin, Mung Bean Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Lauryl Betaine, Betaine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Powder, Dextrin, Allantoin, Water, Ceramide NP, Green Tea Powder, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nCompared to all cleansers I’ve used so far, this was probably one of the best. It’s a pretty light green with a thick paste texture, and has small bits of what seems to be mung bean. In my opinion, you can smell mung bean, just slightly, but I didn’t mind it at all as it reminds me of those asian dessert places haha. The cleanser itself foams, but for me it wasn’t stripping at all. The cleanser contains lots of extracts which could be good for the skin, but honestly since it’s a wash-off product, I couldnt feel any of the benefits :”) The downside would be the price. In my country, it is sold for $12 for 80ml, which is more expensive than any other cleansers I’ve ever used :(\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Toner** ***3.5/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract (80.65%), Propanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Cellulose Gum, Disodium EDTA, Ceramide-NP, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nOkay so this was a 3.5 for me, just because of my skin type and the weather in my country. For oily-combo skin in humid weather, this toner felt slightly too moisturizing, so it felt kind of heavy for me. This would definitely be amazing for dry skin in the summer or oily skin in the winter. It’s a runny toner with a slight slip if you rub it against your hands. I could smell a bit of the chamomile as I apply it to my face but it wasn’t overpowering at all. It was soothing, but the main thing it did for my skin was honestly the moisturizing/hydrating component. If that was what you’re looking for in a runny toner, I’d definitely recommend this!\n\n-\n**Cicaful ampoule** ***4.5/5 WRP***\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract (81.44%), Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone*\n\nI understand you probably are sick with all the cica products dominating the market, but this ampoule was *really good* for me. This ampoule is clear and very viscous, almost like a gel but still relatively runny. As you rub it on your skin it becomes like water, and sinks in reaaally quick. I’ve heard people say this was hydrating for them, but it wasn’t *that* hydrating for me. The calming effect was *amazing* though—redness in my face can minimize as soon as a few hours after application. It felt cooling and very soothing to the skin. Though I would say I run out of the bottle relatively quicker than other serums haha. If you need a calming, no fuss ampoule with minimal ingredients and low breakout risk, this is definitely one to try out!\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Lotion** ***3/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Kelp Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Purified Water, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Squalane (Plant-derived), Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide-NP, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pentylene Glycol*\n\nCompared to other lotions/emulsions I’ve tried, I don’t think I prefer this one. This lotion was a bit thick and holds it’s shape better when you try making it run down. It has the chamomile smell similar to the toner, but far more minimal that you really can’t smell it unless you’re trying to. It’s very moisturizing, probably enough if you use this as a moisturizer in the summer. It spreads well and you don’t need a lot to cover your entire face, but it sinks in less quick, so after using it, it feels like you’ve put a legit cream moisturizer on your face. This was *not* a bad product, but it’s probably better geared towards those with dry skin.\n\n-\n**Hyaluronic Aqua Moisturizer** ***4/5 WRP***\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Methyl Trimethicone, Methylpropanediol, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP, Copolymer, Raffinose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate (100ppm), Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (100ppm), Allantoin, Madecassoide, Beta-glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ethylcellulose, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-51*\n\nRight off the bat, the texture surprised me. This came out as a translucent balm-like gel with no scent, like a less strong vaseline, so for those with dehydrated skin, this one is for you! I was kinda scared using it thinking it was going to be heavy, but I have been using it at night and it’s done wonders for my skin the next morning. Perhaps because my skin is dehydrated, but with this product, my skin texture really improved. As this also was not like a very emollient moisturizer, it felt like it was a layer sealing in all the serum and toner I used before and did not feel clogging at all. Honestly, this product turned out faaaaaar better than I expected!\n\n-\n\nOverall I am really impressed with the brand. None of their products broke me out, which is incredible! All in all I’d say I recommend the cleanser and the cica ampoule for all skin types, the chamomile line for dry skin types (or combo/oily in the winter) and the aqua moisturizer for dehydrated skin. I hope this review was helpful for you and have a great day!",

    "body": "**FROM DEATH’S DOOR TO HEALING: My Secret Weapon and Advice One Year Later**\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFirst off, many of you have already read this so I am going to include some updates real quick before the main article.\n\nIt's winter now and I think it's fair to say that for many of us, we spiral out of control in the winter. I believe this is mainly due to the darkness and here in the states, Daylight Savings Time messing with our circadian rhythms.\n\nMy advice on this one is DO NOT STAY UP LATE, wake up earlier, and buy a happy light. I always went to bed at like 3 or 4 am and woke up late and come Daylight Savings Time, it was always a disaster. But I started going to bed by midnight, waking up at 9, and when I wake up, I go sit in the window where the sunlight is with a happy light 10 inches from my face for about an hour. And if the sun is out, I take off my shirt and get direct sunlight. This changed everything for me. Also, get the free app called f.lux to control the blue light on your screens. It gradually removes blue light the later it gets and this helps control this issue of circadian rhythm.\n\nThe other issue I discovered lately had to do with the pomegranate juice and the berries I suggested. I have to monitor the pom juice, but ESPECIALLY the berries. I still have some every day, but in more moderation. I found that eating too many blueberries in particular has been taking me out. No more than a small handful a day in the salad.\n\nAlso, the coconut milk. You can't let it stay in your fridge for more than a few days or it will grow histamine.\n\nAnyway, here's the main article:\n\nSix months ago, I was on the brink of taking my own life because of this disease. My skin burned and itched and tickled like fire ants were crawling all over me, biting me constantly. I thought I would never sleep again, and I feared I was losing my mind. Nothing I tried was working. But now, I'm stable. I'm healing. And I’m ready to share what I’ve learned to help others who are suffering from this horrendous condition.\n\nAfter battling MCAD for a year, here are a few key takeaways. First, most doctors, even specialists, know shockingly little about the root cause of this disease. Far too many of them are DANGEROUSLY IGNORANT and also ARROGANT when it comes to this topic. In my case, and I stress IN MY CASE, it all came down to leaky gut—a breakdown in the intestinal lining that lets food particles pass into the bloodstream, where the immune system attacks them. You might have something else, like SIBO. But for leaky gut, to heal, you need to understand histamine, histamine liberators, oxalates, sugars, gluten, casein, and lectins. But, if you cut out all those foods, plus do Low FODMAP and low salicylate, you’re left with basically nothing except water and that's a death sentence. The stress of trying to navigate the endless contradictions on the internet was only making the disease worse. I was lost.\n\nBut then I realized something. I realized that, overall, the greatest tool to navigate it all, better than doctors, better than websites or reddit, was ChatGPT. I started using it to track every food, supplement, and medication I was on, and it gave me way better advice than any other source. I asked it to categorize foods by histamine levels, gut health impact, and other factors, and the results were eye-opening.\n\nFor example, I was reacting to apples and told ChatGPT. ChatGPT suggested peeling them. Removing the skin completely. That worked. Now I can eat apples. It’s not perfect, but it’s light years ahead of the brambles of contradictions out there. You just have to be thorough—explain everything and challenge any advice that seems off. Ask it to make sorted lists of things by most to least beneficial or dangerous under those parameters I mentioned earlier. \n\nJust say to ChatGPT “I have leaky gut and histamine intolerance or MCAD. Here are the foods and supplements and drugs I am on. Tell me about each one when it comes to histamine, histamine liberation, oxalates, lectins, gut inflammation, sugar, casein, and gluten. Make me a list of best to worst. Is this good or is this bad? What should I remove, what should I add? How much of this should I be taking? When should I take it?” and so forth. Tell it everything and ask a lot of questions. It’s way better than the websites. \n\n**Here's an example:**\n\nMe: \"ChatGPT. I have leaky gut and MCAD. In terms of histamine, histamine liberation, lectins, oxalates, casein, sugar, and overall gut inflammation, which is worse for me you think? Tortilla chips made with yellow corn, canola oil, and salt, or shredded mozzarella cheese in a bag?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Between shredded mozzarella cheese and tortilla chips made with yellow corn, here’s a comparative analysis based on your conditions (leaky gut and MCAD):\n\n# Shredded Mozzarella Cheese\n\n* **Histamine**: Cheese, especially aged varieties, can be high in histamine. Even shredded mozzarella can contain moderate levels due to the dairy fermentation process.\n* **Histamine Liberators**: Dairy is a known liberator of histamine, which may provoke symptoms in sensitive individuals.\n* **Lectins**: Cheese does not contain lectins.\n* **Oxalates**: Dairy products are low in oxalates, but some cheeses may have moderate levels.\n* **Casein**: Contains casein, which can be inflammatory for those with dairy sensitivities.\n* **Sugar**: Generally low in sugar.\n* **Gut Inflammation**: Dairy can contribute to gut inflammation in sensitive individuals, especially in those with leaky gut.\n\n# Tortilla Chips (Yellow Corn)\n\n* **Histamine**: Generally low in histamine.\n* **Histamine Liberators**: Corn is not known to be a liberator.\n* **Lectins**: Contains lectins, which can be problematic for some people, particularly with leaky gut.\n* **Oxalates**: Low in oxalates.\n* **Casein**: Does not contain casein.\n* **Sugar**: Generally low in sugar.\n* **Gut Inflammation**: Corn may cause gut inflammation in some individuals, especially those sensitive to it.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**For your specific conditions:**\n\n* **Cheese** is likely worse for you due to its histamine content, potential to liberate histamine, presence of casein, and inflammatory potential for those with leaky gut.\n* **Tortilla chips** are lower in histamine and do not contain casein, making them a better option, although they may still cause issues due to lectins.\n\nIf you’re managing histamine sensitivity, it would generally be safer to limit or avoid cheese in favor of the tortilla chips, while being mindful of how your body reacts to both. As always, individual responses can vary, so monitoring your symptoms after consumption can provide further clarity.\"\n\n***BTW, if you're really suffering, don't eat EITHER of these!***\n\n**Here's another one for ChatGPT:**\n\nMe: \"I have histamine intolerance/MCAD and leaky gut. I am taking these medications: Zyrtec, montelukast, famotidine, diclofenac. I am trying to figure out if any of these are hurting my gut. Please make a list from most harmful to least and tell me why.\"\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\"Here’s a list of the medications you're taking, from most to least likely to harm your gut, along with explanations:\n\n# 1. Diclofenac (NSAID)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: High\n* **Reason**: Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause irritation to the stomach lining, increase the risk of ulcers, and exacerbate leaky gut. Long-term use of NSAIDs is known to damage the gut barrier and impair healing, which can worsen leaky gut over time.\n\n# 2. Montelukast (Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Moderate\n* **Reason**: Montelukast is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause gastrointestinal side effects like stomach pain, indigestion, or nausea. While it's not known to directly harm the gut lining, its effects on the gastrointestinal system might still aggravate symptoms for those with sensitive digestion or leaky gut.\n\n# 3. Famotidine (H2 Blocker)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Low to Moderate\n* **Reason**: Famotidine reduces stomach acid, which can relieve symptoms like acid reflux but may disrupt the natural balance of gut flora over time. Reduced acid levels might also make it harder to digest food properly, which can negatively impact gut health. However, it’s generally safer for the gut compared to NSAIDs.\n\n# 4. Zyrtec (Cetirizine, Antihistamine)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Low\n* **Reason**: Zyrtec is an antihistamine that’s considered to have minimal impact on gut health. While it can cause mild gastrointestinal side effects (such as nausea or dry mouth), it's not known to cause significant damage to the gut lining.\n\n# Summary:\n\n* **Diclofenac** is the most harmful for your gut due to its potential to irritate the stomach lining and worsen leaky gut.\n* **Montelukast** could cause gastrointestinal issues but is less harmful.\n* **Famotidine** might alter gut flora, though its impact is moderate.\n* **Zyrtec** is the least harmful, with minimal effects on the gut.\n\nIf you're concerned about how these medications affect your gut, it might be worth discussing alternatives with your doctor, especially for diclofenac.\"\n\nI stopped taking Diclofenac because of this and that's a big part of how I began healing.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you shouldn't look at any websites ever, or Reddit, or go to a doctor, but just know that if you do that, you will likely enter a very confusing maze of truth mixed with contradictions, ignorance, and overwhelming information. You can learn a lot that way, but you can also just become instantly lost. Try incorporating ChatGPT to help out.\n\nThe secret to using ChatGPT correctly is to KEEP IT FOCUSED. If you ask \"Make me a low histamine recipe,\" it will possibly make mistakes like telling you to use lemon juice, avocado, or banana. But if you say \"Analyze these specific foods in terms of histamine, histamine liberation, lectins, oxalates, and gut inflammation,\" it generally becomes INCREDIBLY accurate and useful.\n\n# My Healing Process\n\nI was given antibiotics that destroyed my gut biome, and I took diclofenac, which put literal holes in my intestines. I didn’t realize these things were part of the problem. ChatGPT helped me figure that out, and from there, I could work on rebuilding.\n\nI will state that I don't do low salicylate or low FODMAP along with my diets. If I did, like I said, there would only be water left. If you are doing those, tell ChatGPT.\n\nNow, here’s what worked for me, and while everyone’s different, maybe this will help you, too.\n\n# Drugs\n\nWhat I take before bed:\n\n* Zyrtec (Aller-Tec from Amazon or Costco, 365 pills for 20 bucks) (4)\n* Famotidine (2)\n* Montelukast (1) (this one you do need a prescription for)\n* Quercetin with Bromelain (I'm so unsure about this one; if it is good or bad or does nothing at all)\n* Viagra (Sildenafil) No seriously, this one opens the blood vessels and prevents histamine from pooling in certain parts of the body like my hands and head and causing them to burn and itch. When I was at my worst, the pooling was my number one problem. If you have this problem, go to your doctor and ask for sildenafil, the generic for Viagra, which unlike Viagra, is incredibly inexpensive.\n\nI was on Xolair, but it didn’t help me. If it works for you, great, but don’t believe doctors who say Xolair is the “end of the line.” It’s about healing the gut, and doctors just don’t seem to get that in the slightest. I went to three specialists, and all they offered were antihistamines and “avoid tomatoes.” When I asked them about the connection between my gut and the reactions, they looked at me like I was talking about the Loch Ness Monster coming out of my bathtub.\n\n# Supplements\n\nHere's the deal on supplements. **Don't use multivitamins.** Do one thing at a time. And read the ingredients before you buy them. Most vitamin C for example is hard on the gut and is high in histamine and a histamine liberator. And even if you find one that isn't, they will often have extra ingredients like \"citrus bioflavonoids\" or rose hips or sunflower oil or something. Those are also histamine liberators. You have to work to eliminate any little thing that might cause a reaction.\n\nHere’s what worked for me. Remember, introduce supplements ***ONE AT A TIME***\\*\\*.\\*\\* And take them 10-15 minutes before the meal (except for the probiotic, take after as it could be broken down by the betaine HCl). Also, don't buy all of these all at once. Buy the first phase and then work on that for a few weeks and then move on to the next phase.\n\n1. **NatraDAO DAO** (blue box)\n2. **Pure Encapsulations Digestive Enzymes Ultra with Betaine HCl** (if your gut is really hurting, it might be best to start with the one without Betaine HCl and then move up like a month later. I think this supplement is extremely important.)\n3. **Allergy Research Group Magnesium Ascorbate (plain version)** (a safe form of **vitamin C** without histamine-liberating ingredients like rose hip or citrus bioflavonoids)\n4. **Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Glycinate**\n5. **Pure Encapsulations Calcium Citrate** (to break down oxalates. Take this one with anything higher oxalate like the sweet potato chips I'll mention in a moment.)\n\nThese next two could take time to add, but they’re crucial:\n\n* **Zinc L-Carnosine**\n* **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**, **B2 (Riboflavin)**, and **Copper**\n\nFor this next phase, take your time, and monitor your body's reaction to determine if these are worth it for you right now:\n\n* **PE L-Glutamine (switch to powder form after you build up, something like Naked brand)** (slowly build up from say .5 to 5–10 g daily, taking some on an empty stomach. Although be careful. When I got to 10 grams I started negatively reacting to it and went back to 5 where I still currently am. Everyone is going to be different with this. Ideally you should apparently be taking even higher doses like 20 or 30 or 40 grams, but many of us might not be able to handle that. I kind of use it for a few weeks and then don't for a few. My safe spot is now between 0 and 5 grams.)\n* **Seeking Health ProBiota HistaminX** (Build up to two but I wouldn't go beyond that for a while if you are really struggling overall. I'm still trying to figure this one out. Sometimes I take it, sometimes I don't.)\n\n# Food and Drink\n\nAs far as this stuff goes, if you are REALLY struggling, like you think you might go insane or die, do a reset, **TAKE AWAY ALL YOUR FOOD** and start here.\n\n* **Water** is your best friend. I prefer sparkling water, and no, the carbon dioxide won’t hurt your gut. Stomach acid converts it back to gas and it leaves via your esophagus. I have a SodaStream. I don't use flavorings.\n* **Coconut milk** (hopefully you can find one WITHOUT additives like B12, a possible histamine liberator). I drink Real Coco. **Do NOT let it remain opened in your fridge for more than a few days or it will mess you up!**\n* **Straight Rooibos Tea** (no additional ingredients besides perhaps grated fresh ginger. This tea is a mast cell stabilizer. I drink it with every meal.)\n* **Whatever you do, DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL!**\n* If you are REALLY craving alcohol, like at a party, use **kava from a tincture** in its place.\n* **Don't smoke.** Quit, using nicotine replacement therapy. If you are having cravings, use **nicotine gum** in place of smoking, like at a party or on a trip.\n\nWe'll talk about each of these section as a Phase. Each Phase will likely take several months before adding in the food from the next one.\n\n**PHASE ONE:**\n\nStart simple:\n\n* **White rice** (NON-ENRICHED, the one WITHOUT added vitamins like b12)\n* **Rice noodles** are also a fantastic starch.\n* **Ghee** is amazing for gut health—LOTS of it, especially the refrigerated grass-fed kind. Put it on the rice, the rice noodles, zucchini, veggies, meat, put it on everything.\n* **Zucchini** (But don't let it or any other food cook to the point that it has color or char. At least not for awhile. That makes histamine.\n* **Sea Salt** is a good tool to have. Maybe use the kind WITHOUT iodine, as it may be a histamine liberator for some. Although some people might NEED the iodine.\n\nSlowly add:\n\n* **Asparagus, squash, pumpkin, bok choy, and arugula.**\n* **Gluten-free oatmeal** (Bob's Red Mill)\n* **Fresh herbs** like rosemary, thyme, basil, and tarragon. No marjoram. Double-check each one with ChatGPT.\n\nAnd while leftovers are generally dangerous as they are higher in histamine, leftover cooked veggies seem to take longer for that to happen. You should be okay to eat them for a few days.\n\n**PHASE TWO:**\n\nAdd in gradually:\n\n* **Coconut Oil** (Good, but ghee is probably better. Use sparingly.)\n* **Avocado Oil** works well too.\n* **Fresh-frozen lamb** (I recommend **Wild Fork’s lamb stew meat** from their website) For this one, start with one small chunk, and the next day try two and so forth. I can still only eat like 6 or 7 pieces a day but it's a LOT better than nothing. **MEAT MUST BE FRESH-FROZEN, NEVER THAWED, NOT FROM THE GROCERY STORE. AND NO LEFTOVERS ON MEAT. If it's thawed, it will grow histamine.**\n* **Broccoli, cauliflower, red cabbage, and Brussels sprouts** (These never bothered me, but they do have sulfur so don't overdo it.)\n* **Lesser Evil Brand Paleo Puffs** (straight Himalayan Pink Salt variety made with cassava (THIS ONE IS INCREDIBLE!)\n\nFor salads:\n\n* **Arugula, fresh herbs** (rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, tarragon, etc), olive oil, and a blend of blueberries, blackberries, and pomegranate juice. **(Be very moderate with the berries and pom. Don't eat more than a few berries a day. I made the mistake of starting to eat entire cartons of them and had reactions).** Also, as you cut your vegetables, combine some of each in tupperware and put this mix on your salad. That way, you are also getting some of the uncooked versions with their microbes into your gut. \n* **About pomegranate juice** \\- Pomegranate juice serves as a substitute for vinegar and salad dressing, ESPECIALLY when combined with the berries. Use POM Wonderful. Just make sure it's JUST the straight pomegranate juice version, not a mixture of two juices. You can also make pickles this way. Pomegranate juice with a lot of salt, and a small amount of **fresh** dill *(warning, this may be a liberator so you might want to forego the dill for a while!)* Soak sliced cucumber in it overnight in the fridge. But here's a **WARNING: buy the smallest container of the juice and use it within just a few days. If you get a big one and let it sit for weeks at a time, it will grow histamine. Also, don't overdo the pom juice. And monitor your body for reactions to it.**\n\n**PHASE THREE:**\n\n* **Jackson’s avocado oil (or coconut oil) Sweet Potato Chips (wavy is way better)** (mix with the calcium to handle oxalates). The sweet potato chips are great, but don't overdo them. And yes, even though avocados are an issue, the oil is fine. This stuff is all on Amazon (hopefully.)\n* **Apples (peeled)** (don't eat more than one a day because of sugar content)\n* These snacks will save you from going insane!\n\n**PHASE FOUR:**\n\n* **Fresh frozen chicken** (I buy the Wild Fork cubes from their website) This one I can eat less of than the lamb. Two cubes a day tops for me. Again, **MEAT MUST BE FRESH-FROZEN, NEVER THAWED, NOT FROM THE GROCERY STORE. AND NO LEFTOVERS ON MEAT. If it's thawed, it will grow histamine.**\n* **Brown rice-based gluten free pasta** (Hooray!)\n* **Sweet potatoes** (PEELED. NEVER eat the peel, and combine with calcium to break down oxalates)\n* **Carrot**\n* **Unsweetened, natural, dried coconut chips**\n\n**BAKING:**\n\nAt some point, you should be able to go to the store and buy **GLUTEN FREE BREAD,** the bread that has the least iffy ingredients. Let's see what I'm eating currently.\n\n\"Canyon Bakehouse Gluten Free Country White.\"\n\nIngredients: Water, brown rice flour, tapioca, whole grain sorghum flour, cane sugar, potato starch, whole grain oat flour, expeller pressed canola oil, xanthan gum, and 2 percent or less of egg whites, yeast, sea salt, vinegar.\n\nNow this has some stuff that if you are really struggling might be too much. Eggs and yeast and vinegar. But they are in such small amounts here. I'm tolerating eating two slices quite well currently. I use them to make a **sandwich.** Ghee on toast with rice noodles, lamb and chicken, vegetables like zucchini, arugula, and sesame oil. DELICIOUS!\n\nBut if you CAN'T tolerate this, you'll need to make your own bread.\n\nTo make **BREAD,** you will need these things:\n\n* **Cassava Flour**\n* **White Rice Flour**\n* **Arrowroot Flour**\n* **Sorghum Flour**\n* **Potato Starch**\n\nTell ChatGPT your situation, tell it you have these ingredients and ask for a safe recipe using them.\n\n**PHASE FIVE:**\n\nFor starters, up the **DIGESTIVE ENZYMES WITH BETAINE HCL.** Slowly try to get to where you are taking two with **EVERY MEAL.** Back off if you get nauseous.  \nThen, start trying these things:\n\n* **Egg yolk** (1 to start).\n* **Cinnamon** (seems to be fine)\n* And if you simply must have dessert beyond an apple, try making **rice pudding,** but instead of using regular sugar, always use **monk fruit sweetener with allulose.**\n* And for something with more weight, try **tempura veggies** using rice flour, potato starch, egg yolk and cooked in corn oil. So far, this one hasn't bothered me, but I probably wouldn't do it every day.\n* Small amounts of **garlic, pepper, onion powder.**\n* **Cauliflower Soup**\n* **Pistachios**\n* **Macadamia Nuts**\n* **Turkish Macadamia Butter**\n* **Unsulphured Dried Mangos**\n* **Occasional A2 Milk** (drink a small amount with the sweet potato chips to break down oxalates)\n* **Occasional organic grass-fed butter**.\n* **Rice Chex and regular Cheerios** (These have a small amount of things like molasses that may be triggering so don't overdo it)\n* **Sesame Oil** (Hooray!)\n* **One single corn tortilla** (preferably the rare, refrigerated kind that doesn't have a bunch of other weird ingredients, but any corn one might be okay.) You can use this to put rice, veggies, some sesame oil, arugula, and meat into to make a **taco.** \n* **Start microdosing.** A Pringle. A bite of casserole. Just one per day, and no not one bite of something you know it going to definitely mess you up like tomatoes or spinach. This may or may not be worth it.\n* When you are having a meal with a more advanced thing like dairy or corn or the meat, that's the meal that you should use the most Digestive Enzymes Ultra with Betaine HCl on.\n\nAt this point, you might hit kind of a wall where your histamine bucket overflows. You'll have to really work with ChatGPT and figure out which of the things you recently added is doing it. You might have to slow down or backtrack. It's also why you want to add each one of these gradually, one at a time. Don't have multiple question marks happening at the same time. Just one. Try one, wait several days, then try another. Same thing with supplements. **Do NOT add more than one thing at a time.**\n\nAt this point, I would recommend something that might sound strange.\n\n**Stop taking most of your supplements.** Not the DAO and not the Digestive Enzymes, but everything else. For a week. See how your body likes it. And from then on experiment with taking time off from them. A week, a month, and then back.\n\nIf you have gotten this far, try **vitamin B6 in the form of P-5-P,** although this one might cause reactions. See if you can get one that isn't like \"20 thousand percent daily value,\" but much lower. And for **vitamin b12**, try methylcobalamin.\n\nThis process took me at least six months, but it was worth it. I went from barely eating anything to now having enough variety in my diet that I'm no longer going insane. But the most important thing is that I’m **sleeping through the night again.** The scariest part of this disease is when it starts to look like you'll never be able to sleep again.\n\nDrink **LOTS of water** throughout the day to rid the body of histamine via urination.\n\nEat slowly and chew your food well!\n\nGet lots of sleep. And if you're REALLY struggling, don't exercise much, as it releases histamine. When you start healing, then start adding in exercise.\n\nAnother thing I’d recommend is to ditch any perfumes, colognes, incense and such or at least pay attention to them as they might be liberators. \n\nI CANNOT STRESS THIS NEXT ONE ENOUGH: If you are having serious skin issues like itching, **TAKE A SHOWER RIGHT BEFORE BED!** (not just in the morning, also not too hot) and then put lotion all over yourself immediately when you get out. This helps a lot.\n\nIf your scalp burns and itches, use **Jamaican Mango and Lime No More Itch Gro Spray (mentholated).** Soak it in the stuff and if it's really bad, put a shower cap over that and keep it on in bed. I used to have to sleep that way, but it saved my life. The stuff really helps a lot.\n\nMy hands were really bad too at night. **Cortisone cream** for this one. And try adding **Sarna** to it too. If your scalp is too much for even the spray, put this stuff on your head as well. Maybe everywhere. If all else fails, for itching, use cortisone cream.\n\n# Leaky Gut\n\nAlso, I think one of the most important things I did on my road to healing, and I also can't stress this enough, was watch the documentary **“Hack Your Health: Secrets to Your Gut”** on Netflix. I found that it really helped me understand how this all works, why I developed this disease in the first place, and what to do about it. Understanding more about the gut micro biome is extremely important to healing. Please, for the love of God, watch that one.\n\n# One Last Piece of Advice\n\nIt’s scientifically proven that trauma and stress are literally stored in the body and can manifest as physical diseases, especially autoimmune disorders and gut issues. If you have trauma, it's time to deal with it. Go to therapy. Meditate. Try reiki. Work with a shaman. Listen to solar plexus chakra healing frequencies on YouTube. Study PTSD. Read **The Body Keeps the Score** by Bessel van der Kolk. That one brings it all into crystal clear focus.\n\nI have CPTSD. I wasn’t facing it. I thought if I could just ignore it, I would be okay. But it doesn't work like that. When I reached my lowest point with the histamine disease, it became clear that I had to start healing emotionally in order to heal physically. The moment I began addressing my trauma, my histamine disease started to improve. I think this is a huge part of understanding how to heal from this illness.\n\nTake care of your gut. Address your mental health. Use ChatGPT. And don’t give up.\n\nAlso, if you have any suggestions about how I could personally go further in my own healing or make this better, please let me know.\n\nGood luck to all of you on this journey. You’re not alone.",

Just do your best to make yourself feel better with healthy habits and self care.

Lots of body heat like your burning up from the inside out.\n\nIts a minefield out there so posts like this are very good. I like the idea of peeling apples before eating them. I might try that and see how I get on but when I last tried eating them they stung my lips which I took as a sign to stay away. Also, I like the idea of using AI as a sounding board and to field questions. \n\nAlso, you mention Tortilla Chips.  I wanted to say, yes!! - I also have found that I can eat Nachos (salted only - Not cheese ones) whereas I cant eat other crisps.  I found that tortillas/nachos are made from 100% corn/maize (corn and maize refer to the same plant), which is naturally gluten-free and I have noticed since developing this histamine intolerance I cant eat bread anymore and I took it that I have also become gluten intolerant which is why I can eat nachos until the cows come home.\n\nI have a couple of follow up questions if you don't mind.\n\n1) You say, in your case it all came down to leaky gut.  How did you figure that out.  Did you take a test or was it a conclusion you came to based on your research? \n\n2) Eat slowly and chew your food well! - Why do you say this? Is this based off some research or something you found helps you? The reason for asking is I tend to wolf food down! \n\n3) More of a comment but I agree with you regarding Magnesium Ascorbate.  I made a post here a while back on Vitamin C and to avoid Ascorbic Acid.  At the time I found Ester C which is a non-acidic form of Vitamin C but I have since moved to using Magnesium Ascorbate because its one of the most bio-available forms of Vitamin C. A lot of what we take gets pee'd away.  So thats a good shout.\n\n4) Calcium Citrate - I have not really investigated Oxolates. I dont think they are a problem for me but I dont know. But thanks for explaining about Calcium Citrate.  How well does it help? Do you have to take it before you eat or just generally take it as part of your daily routine?\n\nOne thing I will mention snack-wise that you haven't got on your list thats great to have is popcorn.  Its a great snack and low histamine.  Don't get the store brought stuff.  I brought a Air popcorn maker on Amazon and pop my own.",

    "body": "Synopsis – Treating Sibo is not an exact science. Below is a practical approach, with instructions and dosage, to try to introduce you to the basics of sibo and hopefully cure your sibo, using comparative data from other users that have cured their disease. This user has not cured themselves. Posting despite not being cured in hope that all this research will help someone else in their journey while I go through mine. This is not a completed journey\n\n**Sibo and Me**\n\nBefore you start reading this. I just want to say, there is no one size fits all. If anyone tells you just “do this” or “do that,” they are full of crap. Sibo is too much of a variation for it to be that simple. Each person has different underlying cause and each person has different bacteria makeup for their sibo. Because so many people don’t post their exact symptoms, root cause, treatment plans (success and failed) with dosages and length of time and sibo specific bacteria imbalance (no one has that anyways) (not to be confused with the hydrogen, IMO and Hydrogen sulfide classifications) it is really hard to determine what will work for each person and to compare why something works for one and not another. In addition, there is a difference between cured and remission. Some people claim they are cured and then say they had the symptoms return a year later.\n\nRequired note: “I am not a Dr.” But to be honest, I have met a lot of Drs and many of them are not qualified to give advice and many give wrong advice. You are all responsible to do your own research and never take what someone tells you as absolute truth.\n\n2022.09.15 Final note: I am not fully treated and am currently between phase 3 and 4\n\n**My Background**\n\n36 male. Weight 165lbs (now 155lbs). Relatively healthy, runner, OCR racer\n\nCondition: Hydrogen positive sibo, Methane Negative.  Started July 2021. Symptoms started after second Covid vaccine. Current known diseases: Prior: Osteoporosis (had since 20s) New: EPI pancreas (Take Zenpep 1200), Hashimoto Hypothyroidism (Take levothyroxine), Hydrogen SIBO.\n\nSymptoms: Weariness (no longer running), excessive burping, (Kill your spouse smelly farting on bad days), muscle aches, 15 small duodenal ulcers (treated), sour stomach, occasional headache (assumed histamine intolerance developed from sibo) Not present: diarrhea, constipation, bowel movements have stayed normal at one a day\n\nDiet: for the most part I eat what I want. I know many have severe restrictions and I’m just not that. My sibo remains consistent on most food. Only things I avoid 100% is soy and garlic. Breakfast is consistent daily. Cubed potatoes, kielbasa cubed and eggs put together skillet style. Lunch and dinner vary. I avoid eating out at restaurants that use sauces or soups.  2022.09.15 I now to intermittent fasting.\n\nTesting:\n\nAll bloodwork comes back normal, no deficiencies or low levels, negative for c-diff, ulcerative colitis, Crohns, Celiac\n\nI’ve had CT scans, Gastric emptying scans, Ultrasounds and 2 upper endoscopies. All showing nothing. Did not have colonoscopy due to consistent bowel movements.\n\nDrs seen: 6 GI, 2 PCP. 1 Endo, 1 Rheum, 1 Naturopath (unofficial)\n\nRecommend getting to know your family’s medical history. It can have insights if there is a history of autoimmune disorders.\n\nHere is my theory for how I got sibo based on my research. Covid vaccine triggered latent autoimmune gene. Autoimmune disorder Hashimoto created. Hashimoto damages Thyroid. Damaged Thyroid stop producing normal TSH levels and damages MMC. SIBO begins to form and creates symptoms and ulcers. Drs find ulcers and treat with PPI. PPI reduces acid and SIBO really takes off. SIBO creates damage and EPI begins to form.\n\n**Approach to Success (In process and unconfirmed)**\n\nThis data was gathered by cross referencing YouTube channels, Reddit, multiple websites, Cedar Sanai, books and Facebook groups. I looked at many cases of cured people and compared to others looking for commonalities (Hydrogen cases only). What follows is a plan I put together based on those cured individuals correlations in treatment. Again, please do not take this as “THE CURE”. This disease is expensive even with insurance and I don’t want you all spending money needlessly because you only read this. This plan is the bare minimum approach I could put together based on the data I found. I have included costs as I have incurred so you can be aware prior to starting a treatment. All costs are out of pocket\n\n**Baseline SIBO**\n\n1. Take trio smart breath test to determine which sibo you have. Hydrogen, Methane (IMO) Hydrogen Sulfide. Cost $290 (make sure Dr orders or test includes Lactulose for test)\n2. Take IBS smart blood test to determine if you have certain antibodies (physician required to order) (if positive, treatment may need to be different) (not researched) Cost $199, I was billed $220. This test requires you go to a blood draw location to collect the sample. Cost $50\n3. Get full nutritional assessment for deficiencies (Dr bloodwork) Cost Varies\n4. Alternative testing. FoodMarble Aire 1 or 2. 1 is Hydrogen only, 2 does Hydrogen and Methane. You can get a lactulose prescription (cost $15) and test with that or just test with everything you eat. (I have the Aire 1, wish I bought the Aire 2, even though I was methane negative just to monitor. Love this device and I log breaths almost hourly and when I wake up in the middle of the night. Really helped me figure out foods that made me worse and how well intermittent fasting affected treatment)\n5. (2022.09.30) Get a full stool sample. Some people do one that looks at different bacteria levels. I did one that looked for variations and parasites. I don’t know which approach is better. I took a simple one at my primary care and it ruled out some basics. TI am scheduled to take the Doctors Data: CSA +P Comprehensive Stool Analysis + Parasitology (a three day collection test)\n\nRecommend 1 upper endoscopy (have them take cultures looking for candida). Colonoscopy if GI recommends (typically for constipated patients). Avoid taking PPI’s.\n\nFind a Functional Medicine Dr or good naturopath\n\nYour diet has to change for now. Complete sibo diet or low fodmap to determine major triggers. Work with function, ND or GI Dr. Diet typically means little to no snacking, big meals 3-4. Intermittent fasting while avoiding fermentable foods.\n\n**Determine underlying cause(s) and TREAT underlying cause(s) (Incomplete list)**\n\n1. Hashimoto (Hypothyroidism)\n2. H Pylori\n3. SIFO/SIYO (Candida)\n4. B12 or iron deficiencies\n5. C-Diff\n6. Food intolerance tests (gluten)\n7. IBS (D-M-C)\n8. Crohn’s\n9. Parasites\n10. Histamine Intolerance\n11. PPI use\n12. Mold Disease\n13. Bile acid malabsorption\n14. EPI\n15. Low stomach acid\n16. Low good flora\n17. Heavy metals\n18. Anxiety and Stress\n19. Ileocecal valve syndrome\n20. Vegus nerve disorders (research at home exercises)\n21. Estrogen dominance\n22. Lyme/EBV\n23. Endometriosis\n24. Fibroids\n25. Post surgical adhesions\n26. Psychological issues - trauma (C-PTSD), PTSD, anxiety, depression and others.\n27. Other Unknowns\n\nTypical Autoimmune question: Chicken or the Egg. Sibo can cause autoimmune – autoimmune can causes sibo\n\nUser: shereadsinbed\n\n“SIBO=damage to gut lining= leaky gut=food particles escaping into blood stream=body sees them as intruders= chronic immune reaction=autoimmune disease\n\nAnd/or Autoimmune disorder= motility issues= SIBO”\n\n**Sibo Treatment**\n\nThree Phase approach once treated underlying cause. Order of phases can vary from person to person. Phase 2 is not recommended as first phase.  Phase 3 is the cheapest of each phase.\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n2 weeks antibiotics (40% effective) (Cedar-Sinai) (I personally believe this number is inflated)\n\nXifaxan for hydrogen (Some studies show adding Augmentin)\n\nXifaxan, neomycin, bismuth (Pepto Bismal will work) for methane (IMO)\n\nHydrogen sulfide (Sorry I don’t have any in depth research on this. Likely treat like IMO)\n\nEither treatment take a Biofilm disrupters: Couple options- 30 minutes before food. (Some take this before every meal) (Some take this exclusively for a month before taking antibiotics)\n\n1. NAC (N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine) 600-1000mg- Biofilm disrupter (considered phase 1)\n2. Priority One - Biofilm Phase 2 (Phase 2 is stronger, some only need phase 1, hospitals have stronger than phase 2 used post surgery)\n\nRecommend antifungal (Diflucan) with either as fungus can grow while bacteria die\n\nDiet: Dr Pimentel Recommend eating a high fodmap diet while on xifaxan. (There is mixed results on this approach, I’m not sold on the idea that feeding the bacteria brings them out more for the antibiotic to kill. Either it is protected by a biofilm or it is not.)\n\n(During and end of phase 1 felt no change in Symptoms) (took this treatment 3 times over the course of a year. No change with any round.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n2-3 weeks strictly elemental diet (gives body rest) (80% effective) (Cedar-Sinai) My own research from people’s posting does not support that data. I don’t believe this fixes sibo but that it is an important step to healing your gut. Allows parts of your body to rest like you would an overworked muscles. It is designed to be sipped slowly. Best practices seem to show to have a chilled drink or with ice. Make 1 to 2 scoop beverage 6-12 ounces, add more water if needed. Use a straw to sip over an hour. (The straw helped me not gulp it) Make a glass every 2 hours. Try to consume min 10 Scoops a day (1500 calories). Cost $800-$1500 2-3weeks (prescription required, still not covered by insurance)\n\n[https://sibosurvivor.com/elemental-diet-for-sibo/](https://sibosurvivor.com/elemental-diet-for-sibo/)\n\n(There are some out there that say elemental diet cured them. They typically did 3 weeks. More often than not I see this in YouTube channels and then I listen carefully. Many say they started herbal supplements after the elemental diet and “then” they started feeling better)\n\nAntifungal needed. Elemental diet feeds thrush significantly due to sugars. Brush teeth after EVERY meal, find antifungal mouthwash\n\n(During and at end of phase 2 the only change I felt was no bad farting and less headaches. I did however feel like all the joy in my life was sucked out while on this diet. Again, my research results indicate this doesn’t fix sibo but helps your body rest on your way to fixing sibo) (Please do your own research)\n\nEnding Phase 2 treatment: Low fodmap diet/Elemental diet blend. Don’t just switch back to food. Make a 1 meal a day transition. Recommend not fatty meat only the first week.  (Some of you will have no issue transitioning back to food and others will be really hard)\n\n**Phase 3**\n\nMedications: Start on low dosage (below listed is final dosage)\n\nBiofilm disrupters: Couple options- 30 minutes before food. (Some take this before every meal) – Reference Phase 1 for options\n\nHerbal protocol: 4 weeks herbal antibiotics (three choices below). Some users say take only twice a day. To be consumed with food unless notated otherwise. Recommend pill boxes to keep track of what you have taken when. Diet: Dr Weitz recommends low fodmap with on herbal antibiotics\n\n1. FC Cidal (2 caps 3 times day), Dysbiocide (2 caps 3 times day) and ADP Oregano (200mg 30min before meals)\n\n[https://digestivewarrior.com/](https://digestivewarrior.com/) 2 bottles of 120 fc, 2 bottles 120 days, 3-4 bottles 120 adp Cost$400-$500\n\n2. Candibactin BR (2 caps 3 times day) and AR (2 caps 3 times day)  and Oregano (200mg 30min before meals)\n\nAmazon (costs not calculated) (Not taken by this user)\n\n3. Berberine Complex (2-3caps 3x day), Neem Plus(1 cap 3x day) and ADP Oregano (200mg 30min before meals)\n\nAmazon (costs not calculated) (Not taken by this user) (usually taken by methane positive users)\n\n(I CANNOT STATE THIS ENOUGH. NOT ENOUGH RESEARCH OUT THERE ON HOW THESE HERBALS AFFECT YOUR LIVER) Blood tests for you’re a/g ratio and Globulin are very important when taking these. I don’t see any studies showing they will damage your liver but it can’t be understated that supplements have the potential to do so. I don’t want you to cure sibo and end up needing a liver replacement in the process.\n\nI believe the effectiveness of each herbal antibiotic depends on which overgrowth you have: **Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis or unknown others.** Since previously noted we don’t have that info, it is harder to recommend which one of the 3 options to start with. This makes me sad as I know a lot of users are doling out money they don’t have on approaches that may not work. I have not researched if anyone has determined a correlation and since most user treatment is done unscientifically and without a control, it will likely be years or decades until that is fully locked down. If after finishing 4 weeks with no change, try switching to another option. Keep daily journal of dosage, length of time and results. (Be mindful of supplements if you have liver issues) (Foodmarble Aire 1&2 is a great tool for keeping track of food and results)\n\nI’ve found another plan that matches the above with a few tweaks. Uses same drugs but different dosage, and alternates meds. I like this plan as it seems to give your liver a break and ended up being the one I followed. Plan is 6 weeks as opposed to 4. Link below.\n\n[https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/4004166/Articles%20and%20Abstracts/SIBO%20Protocol.pdf](https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/4004166/Articles%20and%20Abstracts/SIBO%20Protocol.pdf)\n\nWhile on this plan, heartburn increased, farting decreased, took less naps during the day, ran a few times, headaches stayed away for the most part. Burping remained consistent. (I completed one round of herbal antibiotics without much change. I am switching back to regular antibiotics and a different Prokenetic.  (2022.09.11) finished neomycin, 4 days let of xifaxin, headaches returning, heartburn is down, feeling shitty on a daily basis) (2022.09.15 My energy is not what is was while on the herbals)\n\nIf you are taking a supplement and you start to feel really bad then you have to make the hard decision of continue or quit. Feeling like crap could mean your body is rejecting the medicine or it could mean the sibo bacteria is in die off (herxheimer reaction) which is good.  No one can confirm which is which and I get nervous when I see users tell someone to quit or continue. I recommend you get a functional Dr for any approach you take to review your plan and how it aligns with your current conditions. They will be able to better direct you when to continue or quit. Many people are asking for advice off of a few words posted and that isn’t wise.\n\nFor those with concerns of leaky gut. 2 options\n\nL-Glutamine 850 mg per capsule – Amino acids can work to protect the mucous membrane of the esophagus and intestines (2022.09.15 will begin taking this soon)\n\nTributin X – I took this one. 1 pill per meal to start. Move up to 3 per meal. (Didn’t change anything for me.)\n\n[https://healthygut.com/product/tributyrin-x/](https://healthygut.com/product/tributyrin-x/)\n\n**Supplement Support post Phase 3**\n\nMotility agent for MMC (Prokenetic) to keep gut moving and keep sibo from repopulating. Recommended after herbal antibiotics unless currently constipated.(reason given is you don’t want the antibiotic moving too quickly through your system) Use for minimum of 6 months after completing phase 3. Examples: Prescription: Motegrity (side effects suicide, depression), Low dose erythromycin 50mg nightly (most big pharmacies wont’ have it, has to be compounded by pharmacist and insurance won’t cover Cost $50 per month). Non Prescription: SIBO MMC, Motilpro, Antrantil, Integrative Therapeutics Motility Activator\n\nI took Integrative Therapeutics Motility Activator 2 times a day and LDE 1 at night.\n\n2022.09. Switched from LDE and Therapeutics to Motilpro\n\nMMC description below and why it isn’t the same as your bowel movements\n\n**Jordan J**\n\n“So. . .the MMC is a series of self-cleansing waves that passes through the stomach and small intestine \\*in the absence of food\\*. It's not the same thing as peristalsis which moves food through your system. Stool consistency is determined not by the MMC but by the colon, whose job it is to remove water from what you've eaten as it passes through. So, folks with D can still have MMC issues. Since the more we look into the MMC the more it seems as though it's involved in the majority of SIBO cases, and it's not obvious who has MMC issues without special testing, doctors are recommending prokinetics to most or all SIBO patients, at least for use for several months post-antibiotics, to reduce the chance of relapse.”\n\n[https://agutsygirl.com/2019/04/26/a-gutsy-girls-master-guide-to-prokinetics/](https://agutsygirl.com/2019/04/26/a-gutsy-girls-master-guide-to-prokinetics/)\n\n**Additional Supplements**\n\nSome people will need additional supplements, depending on their root cause.\n\nOx bile to bind bile acid (I have not taken)\n\nBetaine HCL to produce stomach acid (Thorne most recommended) (I have not taken) Some Dr’s recommend bitters over HCL as they stimulate natural acid production. Bitters Extra by Vitanica is one product but I believe it has to be prescribed.\n\nDigestive Enzymes (I do take but is prescription for my EPI, ZENPEP $17,000 monthly) (Did not change any of my symptoms by itself) (Not sure it is really doing anything frankly) (If insurance didn’t pay for it, I wouldn’t take it)\n\nAllicin (Typically taken by Methane Dominate users as anti-microbial) (I have not taken)\n\n**Complete**\n\nAfter completing phase 1-3 if your sibo remains, it is possible you have yet to discover all the underlying causes.  Doesn’t mean you haven’t, just a possibility. Sibo is very complex and requires a unique combination approach tailored specifically to you and can only be discovered through trial and error. You can still be bloated and sibo free. Testing is required to know if sibo is gone but gut damage can remain and take months to restore to normal.\n\n**Last resort (Phase 4?)**\n\nFind a location that will do a fecal transplant (FMT) (pill form). Dr used to be able to treat sibo this way before 2014 when regulations changed. FDA now only allows for C-diff in the US with insurance. Screw you FDA! I did find a company in California that will do it sans insurance. Cost min $5k and the initial consult is $400. Link below. (I did my initial consult and the Dr ordered a stool test which was another $400. He also prescribed different supplements to take in the meantime. I don’t post cost to be discouraging. I don’t want people to have to guess.)\n\n[https://www.puretyclinic.com/fecal-transplant-fmt-santa-barbara](https://www.puretyclinic.com/fecal-transplant-fmt-santa-barbara)\n\nSuccess study on FMT Link\n\n[https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-021-01630-x](https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-021-01630-x)\n\nImportant note from other user: Dr Pimentel determines this to be ineffective. Reminder his studies are around patients with food poisoning as root cause. Either way, FMT is definitely understudied in application beyond c diff and expensive.\n\n**Diet**\n\n(2022.09.14) I don’t speak a lot on diet because this disease is vastly different for everyone and what foods make their symptoms worse. You may read it’s okay to eat this or that so you do and it makes you so sick. Then you are frustrated and I know you are already frustrated because who else reads this far if they aren’t already at their wits end. Each person must trial and error what foods work for them. A general rule of thumb around diet is low fodmap and intermittent fasting. For me I stop eating at 7pm and won’t eat until after 9am. If I follow this, I generally feel better. If I wake up at midnight and snack, I feel it in the morning.\n\n**Final Notes**\n\nI’m sure people reading this have read or heard of many other options, supplements and approaches. I am not discounting those options, I just did not find a commonality when reviewing personal stories of cured individuals. Brands may vary as well.\n\nOne consensus was stay away from prebiotics and probiotics, except (Saccharomyces Boulardii) and only with limited use. Some report that even this strain has variations and you can end up with the wrong one. (I have not done that much research into it)\n\nI am wary of any Dr that just promotes their stuff, natural or prescription, any admin that says they have the cure, or any plan that promotes pre or probiotics. I immediately run from anyone that says they were “cured” but you have to DM them for their method.\n\nStay away from any form of acid suppressor (PPI). I know for many with heartburn, this is a very tempting go to (myself included). 100% show this will make your sibo worse and it did mine. (Suggestions given to me but I haven’t tried: Apple cider vinegar I glass of water (morning), charcoal tablets, GasX.  More research should be done by the user before taking these to ensure they are not just another form of acid suppression)\n\nPlease get out there and read everything you can. Even if it has conflicting info. Glean from others what passes the smell test and figure out what works for you. Don’t stop reading an article because it has conflicting info. There may be a nugget in there that leads you down another path. There are not short cuts or quick fix pills.\n\nPlease note that links are for reference only. I have ZERO association with any of the sites and if you find something cheaper elsewhere, buy it elsewhere. Just be careful to know what you are buying. I have not posted links to any site I have not bought from personally.\n\n**Items to explore:**\n\nLDN Low dose Naltrexone for autoimmune disorders 0.5- 4.5mg dose. For people with inflammation and autoimmune disorders. Dosage varies significantly from person to person. Seems highly unregulated even though it requires a prescription.\n\n[https://ldnresearchtrust.org/what-is-low-dose-naltrexone-ldn](https://ldnresearchtrust.org/what-is-low-dose-naltrexone-ldn)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0p0ykSzy9o&ab\\_channel=LDNscience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0p0ykSzy9o&ab_channel=LDNscience)\n\nIf you have questions, I will answer what I can. I will not give you definitive yes or no on items I have not researched.\n\nSee follow up links in below post",

        "body": "This is very informative and scary to say the least. I just tested positive for combined Methan and Hydrogen SIBO. Methan is higher. I am just starting my antibiotics Rigaximin, Metronidazole and 1/2 Purcalopride for motility. My symptoms slow digestion ( I am using digestive enzymes currently and have been for 2 weeks) no appetite, upper and lower bloating. Stomach just sore all the time. Just started getting constipated a few weeks ago but all along have been very regular. And like you use to be very active running a few times a week and teaching fitness classes. Slowly since this began  a year ago I have had to give that all up and I have lost 30 pounds. I am 5,11 and 155 now. I am not positive yet what my root cause is. This all began with upper bloat and heartburn for weeks on end so my doctor put me on PPi’s was on them for 8 months and they never helped I understand now why they didn’t. Symptoms would improve them get worse. I did have a stomach bug back in Jan 3 days after my Covid booster shot? This may have also contributed to it. Things got really bad then including a huge amount of anxiety and stress. I have always been a very healthy person and have never experienced anything like this.I have had a ton of bloodwork an ultrasound,2 chest ex rays,  MRI and upper scope all have come back clear with exception of very mild gastritis. Particular food does not seem to set me off and I have tried every elimination diet and I do not drink alcohol anymore. My open question. To you is while on the antibiotics should I be eating low fod map or can I eat more diverse food while doing the treatment. As I understand it during the antibiotic round you should eat more ‘regular’ foods to help “nuke” the bacteria and get a better result with killing them off? I know I have a long road to getting this beast under control and I just want to get even half my life back to where I was before. Thanks for any input.",

Like with everything medically related there will always be conflicting info even among doctors and medical professionals. \n\nIn terms of not starting a prokinetic when constipated, probably would be helpful to use a laxative first to help clear out prior to taking the prokinetic but a prokinetic should be started and used regardless of regularity. As you pointed out, MMC and regularity is not the same thing. \n\nIn terms of last resort FMT would not be a good idea for SIBO. Pimentel mentioned how this did not work for SIBO and in fact caused even more harm. This is why he's also not a big believer in GI Maps, much like genomes no two macrobiomes are the same. And determining a healthy one from a non-healthy one is especially challenging. There still needs to be much research done for this to be more effective at determining treatment. However, some do point out that it helps to identify things like Candida or mold but those can also be identified via other tests like OAT as well. FMT is only good for Cdiff. In that case the macrobiome is noticeably different and needs to be completely repaired just like in cancer patients. \n\nI'd also like to add that adrenal testing might be beneficial for some in identifying root cause as well as an endocrinology blood panel to rule out Addisons, Cushings also rule out heavy metals, oxidative stress, etc.\n\nAlso, chronic disease, lyme/EBV should also be considered as root cause issues. \n\nThanks for taking the time to post all this, hope it helps others!",

    "body": "Hi guys! Long time lurker here, finally decided to post my first review! A little background about my skin: I have combination skin, leaning towards oily (especially during these summer months). I've been using this sub as a guide in my quest to \"perfect\" my routine. While the journey was quite expensive, I've learned that my skin tends to react that a number of common ingredients (most AHAs and BHAs are too harsh for me, coconut oil and most of derivatives, niacinamide, essential oils, high concentrations of hyaluronic acid). I was getting frustrated as I just needed a perfectly effective and safe toner for my nitpicky skin. Lo and behold--\n\n**TONER**: **ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner**\n\nWhile this might not be popular on this sub, it seems to be well loved in Korea (EXO's Suho is known to use this toner, I've also come across a few youtubers who swore by it). Heartleaf or Houttuynia Cordata Extract has been a rising ingredient lately. It's known to soothe sensitive skin, protect the skin from external irritations, and maintain oil-moisture balance.\n\n***Does it live up to its claims?*** Yes. After using this toner for 2.5 weeks, I've noticed that my skin texture is smoother after weeks of mask acne. I've been developing constant ccs due to the trapped humidity and heat of the mask around my jaw, but this toner has calmed down a lot of my irritation and texture. The consistency is very watery, so I often put 2-3 layers and I've found that my skin has been generally more resilient throughout the day (less redness, less oil). Most youtubers seem to use it for toner masking, which I will soon try! It does seem to be more soothing than hydrating, but hydrating nonetheless. I find myself waking up to completely replenished skin when I pair it with my SIDMOOL Royal Honey Peptide Deep Moisture Pack. This toner has reached HG status.\n\n***Any cons?*** It is quite pricey at $26.00 for 250 ml, some sites even have it listed as $30-45. I personally find it worth it, as I've tried too many to count that did not work for me (PKY, soonjung, cezanne, hada labo, kiku). It is also less accessible, but I know yesstyle recently started carrying their whole line and for the cheapest available price!\n\n*Full List of Ingredients:*\n\n*Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Panthenol, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract,* ***Butylene Glycol***\\*, Vitex Agnus-Castus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Malus Domestica Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Isopentyldiol, Methylpropanediol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA\\*\n\nThe ingredients are very clean-- as reiterated throughout their branding. Unless you have an allergy to any of the extracts, or an extreme sensitivity to butylene glycol (which I sometimes do have, but this toner seems to work as butylene is farther down the list), I can't see it wreaking havoc on most skin. Perhaps, the worst case is it does nothing. YMMV of course (!!), but I've never been so impressed with a product that I've been compelled to post about it. Sensitive skin girls, unite! Thank you for reaching the bottom of this page. <3",

Boulardii**\\*, **spore-based probiotics (SIBO-friendly)**\n\nBiofilm   breakers and immune boosters (also best taken in between meals on  empty  stomach, but maybe not at the exact same time as the probiotics):\n\n* **Propolis, lactoferrin**\n\nVitamins that are important to maintain but not overdo (even high vit C intake can cause gallbladder stones, beware):\n\n* **Zinc, iron, vit C, vit D**\n\nFor people with leaky gut/ibs/ibd/crohns/colitis:\n\n* **Hydrolized Guar Gum** (30 mins after lunch/dinner)\n* **Glutamine**  (on empty stomach)Kickstart  your protocol by only consuming homemade  bone broth with olive oil for 3  days to reset your stomach before you  make sure to eat low-fodmap,  low-oxalate, gluten-free, low-sugar food  (fruits are ok, even if some  people think this is not good on a candida  diet for example, it's up to  each person to check which foods they  react to and make their own ideal  diet based on this), and most  important of all: different kinds of  complex carbs and resistant  starches.\n\nFor people suffering **heartburn**, weak nails, hairloss, yeast infection, indigestion:\n\n**Betaine + pepsine** before every meal (or apple cider vinegar in water, although it's cheaper and not as effective for most)\n\n**Enzymes** with meals\n\nTopical   treatment while doing this, or for anyone who seeks instant relief or   who got a local infection that they think they may rid themselves of   without it getting chronic:\n\n* **Boric acid** pill inside the vagina every night (may be made by yourself at home with the help of **food grade gel capsules**\\*)\n* **Probiotics or lactic acid** inside the vagina every morning\n* Consider   growing out your pubes a little by the entrance so that your flora is   protected and maintained. This makes it possible to simply dab some   probiotic on the outside and let them do their wonders without risking   irritation or imbalance, for example for those who wants to use yogurt   but find it uncomfortable or who are extra sensitive (like me!)\n\n**You may make your own yogurt**\\***,   preferably with Reuteri and Rhamnous bacteria, buy lactic acid pills,   or use another way of probiotic of your choice, whether it be probiotic  powder for consumption\\*** or **probiotics** **marketed for vaginas specifically**\\*   although this is so expensive i suggest you also plan for something  you  can use over a longer course than a week in case it takes longer or  you  need maintenance during periods.\n\nNB: this reuteri and rhamnous yogurt is also insanely good for your stomach and is often tolerable by sensitive people\n\n# Explanation behind my protocol:\n\n*PH values, blood sugar, cortisol levels and microflora are everything to our bodies.*\n\n**PH:**   If your stomach is too basic, it's easy for things to go wrong with  the  rest of your body including the vaginal PH. Too high PH values  result  in non-beneficial bacteria and fungi (candida) to live inside  your  digestive system and vagina. Avoid acid blockers as if your life  depends  on it for this reason! Many docs prescribe acid-blockers to  people who  experience heartburn even though most people **suffer heartburn because of lacking stomach acid**\\* rather than having too much of it.\n\n**Blood sugar:**   Blood sugar and hormones are closely linked. Most people don't know  this  and especially for womenat some times in their cycle, for example close to  menstruation,  the hormonal changes and the instability it causes the  blood sugar  causes candida to thrive more - at a time where we crave  sugary and  carby foods the most! This is easily manageable by consuming the right carbs,  proteins and  starches at the right time (or all the time, really). For  people who  borderline diabetic patterns, **berberine is a wonderful herb for lowering blood sugar levels**\\*   BUT this should only be consumed if you're sure that your blood sugar   is too high already, or else you will suffer low blood sugar.\n\n**Cortisol levels:**   When blood sugar is low, cortisol is produced to produce glucose.   Cortisol is also produces when we are stressed, whether it be because   we're happily working (out) or suffering physically, mentally or   spiritually. Sleep, hydration, relaxation, therapy and good management   of everyday life is the only real cure to high cortisol levels, but this   is also immensely improved with a diet that supports your microflora,   blood sugar levels, and YOU, in all its entirety. I strongly recommend **acupressure at home**\\*.\n\n**Microflora:** **Our immune system, digestive system, vaginal system and mental state of mind all rely on our microflora**\\*\n\nAntibiotics  should be avoided by all means necessary and only  consumed in cases  where nothing else is possible, this is more important  than ever seeing  as antibiotics are getting increasingly useless and  part of the reason  is not only bacteria's resistance to it, but the  fungis that  inevitably arise from it and their fast paced development as  they're  allowed to thrive. If you've ever undergone a course of  antibiotics,  the chance that you're having either a low key or full  blown candida  infection is fairly high and although it might not hurt  you so much you  realize it's there, it's known for causing chronic  misdiagnosed BV,  yeast infections anywhere like in the toenails, IBS, insomnia, acne, depression and  many other  \"small\" or rather big but advanced problems that usually get  blamed on  anything but candida by common medicine.\n\n**The info about carbs is very women-centered because female bodies rely on carbs in a unique way. More men find relief and solution in keto without problems, while for women this should not even be possible, at least not for most women.**\n\n*All   of these symptoms were \"magically\" removed for me when i started   treating my self-diagnosed candida infection, and some of these had been  discussed with doctors many years ago without much help other than  antibiotics or topical creams that didn't work but made the problems  worse as time went by.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **All links\\* are found in my comment because of sub rules regarding links**",

        "body": "Okay so this is my FIRST ever Reddit comment, and of course I come to this page haha. (25yo F). I had a chronic yeast infection (horrible horrible yes) for THREE YEARS. And it was not on and off... it was always on. It felt so painful, I was so insecure, very sedentary and depressed and had a horrible diet full of saturated fats, high cholesterol foods, a lots and lots of sugar. Welp, I finally went to see a holistic wellness coach who specialized in \"women's health\" for folks with vaginal yeast infections and she told me about gut health and BIOHACKERS!! Basically the yeast in your gut and vagina is sending signals to your brain to FEED its colonies more sugar, that is their foundation!! The research is actually wild. That is why going on a Candida Diet can be extremely harsh on your system and nearly impossible to go on if you cut out sugar cold turkey (which is \"the best way\" to get rid of yeast infections). WELL WELL WELL, lo and behold I find a simple video online talking about a health drink that this online creator drinks all the time not just for gut health but for skin and hair health. THIS ALONE HAS COMPLETELY TAKEN CARE OF MY THREE YEAR CHRONIC YEAST INFECTION. It is SO simple: (1) two to three spoonfuls of yogurt (I use Stoneyfield Organic Yogurt because of the six bacteria cultures), (2) fill rest of a cup up with water to your desired amount, (3) a little bit of salt for taste, (4) OPTIONAL: ginger powder. It has been amazing. Overall, we all need a foundational diet that really repairs our full gut beyond this one addition. But every day drink this yogurt water once in the morning or once in the evening and you will be set. It will make things easier for you to trust in repairing your gut health because of the immediate changes you are likely to see. From here, I felt motivated enough to really reform my entire diet. It is SO IMPORTANT to remember that dieting should NOT be about removing most things, and it is all about ADDING in what is beneficial and eliminating what is harmful (mainly sugar). Every body is different and progress looks different for everyone. Our culture(s) measure success in different ways along with measuring health and the \"ideal\" health. I am here to tell you that you CAN do this, every body's goals are different and valid, and health doesn't look just one way. Find what works for you. Cheers, and TO DEATH WITH THE BIOHACKERS! Lmao. :)",

    "body": "\n1.be patient with yourself and hang in there-this is not an easy obstacle to overcome and it takes a toll. Take the proper time you need to regain your health and focus on healing.(I personally had to request time off of work and even went on short term disability.) \n\n2.Find a doctor that does not disregard your feelings/symptoms. I hate to push holistic medicine but I did not get the necessary help I needed until I found a holistic doctor I trusted and he knew his stuff when it came to HIT and other health conditions involving the gut. All other drs before literally were prescribing me anti anxiety meds and telling me I had fibromyalgia. \n\n3.Diet!!! This is huge. Because without this step, you will be in constant turmoil. Start a low histamine, lectin, low oxolate diet and STICK TO IT. Train your mind that you do not need other foods off these lists for a good 4 months minimum while you lower your histamine bucket and then as you stop reacting to foods you can place your focus elsewhere. (Please note and see comment below regarding slowly reducing oxolates from diet as a cold turkey approach on low oxolates can cause intense symptoms)\n\n4.Supplements!!! Another HUGE step. Do your research, consult your holistic doctor(many general doctors are more familiar with medications/prescriptions than supplements((a damn shame)). I personally started with DAO right off the bat. It’s important to research every supplement you plan to take beforehand as many can cause histamine release w/o knowledge. I always split capsules/pills for the first time that I try anything. My current supplements are: DAO, Enterovite, adaptogen-R3, Methyl-Sp, Betaine HCL, Digestive enzyme, probiotic that is approved to help histamine intolerance(from seeking health), ox bil, hepato synergy, calcium D glucarate, pregnenalone and progesterone(during cycle only). \n\n5.I cannot stress this enough- FIND THE ROOT CAUSE. I really urge you not to rely on bandaids aka antihistamines and H2 blockers or steroids. If your reactions are really bad then OF COURSE use whatever means necessary to help you in a bad situation. But in the long haul I personally noticed that these bandaids were contributing to my intolerance rather than helping. I realized the diet alone was not helping and I was reacting to everything in this world so I decided to do my own research with my holistic doctor by my side and we found a bacterial infection known as h pylori, I had SIBO, low HCL, adrenal fatigue, sluggish gallbladder/liver, oestrogen dominance. Now that I am supplementing these finds with proper vitamins/ nutrients I have found the biggest difference. We are not back to 100% normal but I am finally able to wear makeup again, and go weeks without any issues. Finding the root cause can work so much quicker and be an easier fix than the bandaid method that can just string things along long term.\n\n6.although this step may not be huge for everyone… it was for me. FASTING. I found that before I met with my holistic doctor I was eating constantly… like literally snacking all day and not giving my mmc or motility a break. I never realized that shitting once a day was necessary and I never realized that I was not fulfilling that necessity. My detoxification process was shot and we linked this to slow motility from eating constantly and not allowing my mmc to make its sweep between meals. I tried fasting for 16 hours for 1 night after my very first consult with my holistic doctor and when I say I was starving… I mean it… but when I say this was the first time in months that I didn’t swell for 12 hours straight… I also mean that. Slowly my gut digestion is progressing and my bowel movements(tmi sorry) are everyday and this is a huge improvement and I know it has contributed to my progress. Make sure you research the proper ways to fast. I use the 16/8 method where I fast for 16 hours from 6pm-10am then I eat 2 meals within an 8 hour timeframe. If you literally research the benefits of fasting you will be mindblown(I know I was). I wish I had it in my to do a 72 hour fast to reset my stem cells but I think I would personally drop dead. But it is on my bucket list however you do need proper supervision!!!\n\n\nI am only sharing this information because I really wish I knew all of this right from the start when I was struggling so bad that I wanted to admit myself to a psych ward. Not even joking. \nI know these steps may not be for everyone… but if it helps anyone at all even one person then I will be satisfied with just that. \n\nMy low histamine diet:\nBreakfast- bowl of gluten free oatmeal mixed with water and a tbsp of chia seeds, butternut squash diced and plopped into the air fryer(lightly salted), cauliflower rice, coconut blueberry gluten free pancakes(I use literally coconut milk, coconut flour, and blueberries that I purée myself.), pistachios, and a couple spoonfuls of homemade tigernut butter with toasted tigernut flower and coconut oil. I drink aloe Vera juice with each meal. \nDinner- cauliflower crusted gluten free chicken(about 5 pieces-these are frozen prepackaged but organic and very clean), diced squash in the air fryer once more, bok choy, that same coconut blueberry pancake, the same tigernut butter, pistachios.\n\nEdit(months later): my diet has changed a bit. Breakfast: bowl of gluten free oatmeal with chia seeds and water, a cup or more of quinoa with sea salt, and a low histamine muffin made from coconut flour, chia seeds as eggs and coconut milk. Dinner: same chicken as listed before, broccoli, large amount of quinoa. Twice a day I have a shake that has coconut milk, pumpkin seed protein powder(2scoops) and a handful of frozen kale(for fresheners). \n\nI am doing much better and can tolerate oxolates again. I will update my diet once more. \n\nEverything I have done was incredibly successful for me, I was thinking about recording a YouTube video to share my story and the recipes mentioned above. Lmk if that would help.",

For some this may not be a problem, but for those on a VERY high ox diet, dumping can bring really intense symptoms. The health pros that work on this issue all recommend a slow reduction.",

My background is that I've suffered from **brain fog, slow thinking, anhedonia, low energy**, and some anxiety and flattened emotions for as long as I can remember. Always felt I should be able to perform better but something was blocking my brain. I've gone through different things trying to fix it, including\n\n- sleep pattern and diet changes, exercise\n- stimulants\n- atomoxetine\n- sarcosine\n- NAC\n- various supplements: vitamins, fish oil, A-GPC, iodine, magnesium, yohimbine, resveratrol, d-ribose, betaine, arginine, citrulline, ALCAR, PQQ, COQ10, and many I don't remember outright\n\nThe various supplements didn't do much, meanwhile the other things gave me major relief for a while, but none of them ended up working reliably for longer than a week, and they lost their effectiveness within the span of weeks to a few months.\n\nSo, then I found out about this \"methylation\" thing, which is really about ameliorating things that function poorly in your metabolism. Here's two of my most memorable resources if you want to read more*:\n\n- https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/2019/03/01/start-here-for-mthfr-and-methylation\n- http://heartfixer.com/AMRI-Nutrigenomics.htm\n\nSo, I figure an **S-adenosylmethionine deficiency** is a thing that's one major source of my problems. I could write tons about that, but I don't want to ramble, you can just google it and read the resources for more info - basically what's for certain is that SAM is important and you don't want to run a deficiency, so if your body is struggling to keep it balanced you need to change something. Without further ado, here's my stack for that:\n\n- **5-MTHF** (metafolin) 100 - 300 ug daily, 100 ug at a time\n\t- Alleviates my brain fog and anhedonia\n\t- Only take more than 100 ug if I don't feel \"right\" that day\n\t- Focused on morning to midday\n\t- Can easily become negative if I take too much, especially with creatine\n- **Creatine** ~4 g daily, 1 g at a time\n\t- Speeds up my thinking and gives me mental energy an resilience\n\t- Gives me physical endurance\n\t- Used to take less, but 4 g helps keep my levels up better and I can tolerate if if I don't take 5-MTHF too much\n- **Glycine** 4 g daily, 2 g at a time\n- **2 big eggs** daily\n\t- Seems to support quick thinking, if I don't take any for a week I become slower and can't function well in quick everyday situations\n\t- **Choline** from them is probably a key factor, the extra protein might also help\n\nI take creatine + 5-MTHF + glycine when I wake up, to start the day. Then I take 0 - 2 doses more of 5-MTHF if I feel a thick brain fog coming in, then I switch to taking creatine for the rest of the day. Dosing hasn't been easy to figure out, and one major thing I've noticed is that there's a downside to taking too much of both creatine and 5-MTHF, where their effect starts becoming the opposite, so I try to space them out except for the initial morning dose.\n\nI also take:\n\n- NAC randomly at least every few days, 320 mg or 160 mg\n\t- Initially fixed my brain fog and should help keep oxidative stress in check\n- A methylated b-complex or B2 and B12 daily\n\t- Making sure I don't miss any other B vitamins\n- Some vitamin C, zinc, selenium about every other day\n\t- These may support methylation related processes\n- Vitamin D 50 ug daily, some magnesium and iodine\n\nEver since starting creatine and 5-MTHF, I've also enjoyed exercise a lot more and actually started noticing cognitive benefits from it, so I make sure to move around daily and properly exercise at least every 3 days. Obviously also make sure to get enough sleep and eat well (avoiding sugar, not eating too much carbs, eating plants).\n\nI've been on this kind of routine for months now and it hasn't pooped out, my quality of life is still way better than ever before, so it really feels like a complete solution for my problems at this point.\n\nThis likely isn't universal for everybody, but if you're struggling with similar symptoms, you could try something like this out. All of the stuff listed is very safe and occurs naturally in food, so give it a try, play around with doses and see if it helps.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATES**\n\n**2021-01-04**\n\nFigured I should do a follow-up on the post. All in all, the stack is still working. It's not 100 % reliable, but I'm still way more functional than \"naturally\", and I no longer have actual bad days, just decent to great. I've made some changes since first posting, and they've increased the frequency of my good days. Here's the gist:\n\n- Creatine: Upped to a static 8 g per day, in doses of 2 g throughout the day. No more issues from it and no effects from extra dosing, feels like my levels are saturated.\n- 5-MTHF: Now try to take at least 300 ug a day, but sometimes take up to 600 ug. If I feel brain fog forming, I take it and it usually goes right away.\n- Choline: I've put an increased focus on it. I found out 5-MTHF worked worse when I didn't get a lot of choline. Could easily be explained by a SAM deficiency, as the body's choline synthesis may use up SAM. I take 500 mg choline bitartrate daily, sometimes up to 1000 mg if 5-MTHF doesn't seem to be working, but no more - you can easily go overboard.\n- I avoid taking creatine, choline or 5-MTHF at the same time - I've found they can interact with each other and somehow go overboard. Maybe a sudden SAM excess? When I take all of these one hour apart, I can easily recognize which supplement is helpful at that time and which isn't, and I avoid any acute interactions.\n- I've added sarcosine - I take 100 - 400 mg on some days. This was just a stroke of luck because I had some lying around and decided to give it a try, then noticed it seemed to make me more present and clear-headed. It doesn't do anything positive if I overdo it, but every few days it seems to become beneficial. Could this indicate a lack of glycine in my brain? Dunno.\n- NAC: It sometimes seems to help a lot when I'm foggy, so I take it more liberally - I've taken about a gram on some days without major adverse effects, but usually around 600 mg max.\n\n**2021-07-23**\n\nI'm still doing better than before, and now my stack seems to be becoming more stable - stable enough that I no longer have to fear it pooping out unexpectedly and not knowing what to do. I'm struggling a bit with my energy levels on some days (putting in a steady amount of productive & challenging work every weekday is still a challenge), but other than that I feel pretty much cured. This will probably be my last update here unless the stack poops out on some day.\n\nHere's the latest adjustments I've made:\n\n- 5-MTHF: 400 ug every day constantly. I also take a mild methylated b-complex OR an equivalent multivitamin every day.\n- Choline: 1100 mg per day normally, but now when I first see signs of my brain stopping working, I take 2750 mg on that day. This seems to ensure I have enough choline around in my body and causes no side effects when done only when needed. I don't take creatine on the same day, because it could interact with choline and make it hard to tell when I've had enough of both.\n- Creatine: I've realized this is the most significant variable in my stack. I take 4.5 grams on a normal day, but sometimes I need up to 10 g per day. Being physically active seems to have an impact on how often I need to boost my creatine levels. On the other hand, taking too much creatine can turn into a negative (for instance increasing my brain fogginess), so I need to be careful with its dosing. I've found a creatine \"overdose\" can have effects for a couple of days in my body.\n- No more need for sarcosine (or proper effects from it), NAC very occasionally at 500+ mg.\n\nMy current routine is focused on having enough choline and creatine, but also not accidentally dosing too much of them. I always dose choline first when I'm starting to feel crappy, so that I know the issue is low creatine rather than a lack of choline. Then I do 1 to 2 days of taking max 10 g of creatine per day - as much as I feel I need until I'm feeling energetic again. This boosting is usually enough to make me feel awake, energetic and functional again, if not then I repeat the cycle 1 or 2 times. If it still doesn't work, I take 1 or 2 of days of reduced dosing to ensure I haven't gone overboard with something, and then try boosting both choline and creatine again. If nothing else worked before, this does. As a result, I still have some weaker days when I'm trying to improve my SAM levels, but no more completely crappy and hopeless periods where nothing seems to work.\n\n**2021-10-09**\n\nFeels like I've finally found a system that completely solves my problems! The key was [vitamin A and the GNMT enzyme](https://old.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/q4smba/if_youre_having_problems_with_overmethylation/) - earlier I've been supplementing glycine to support GNMT, but it didn't seem to do all that much lately - turns out because I might have been deficient on vitamin A! Supplementing vit A has made me much more resistant to \"over-doses\" of choline and creatine, presumably through improved GNMT function in combination with glycine. Thanks to this, I have been able to increase my creatine doses a bit, making my stack work really steadily and reliably now, with hardly any negatives!\n\nI've increased my normal creatine doses to 6.5 grams a day now, I supplement 1500 ug of retinyl palmitate daily and I increased my glycine doses to 10 grams a day. Everything else is the same as before. I feel way steadier and consistently functional now, but I still need occasional boosts of creatine and choline every few days - when I notice my brain slowing down I do as previously described, take one day to boost my choline intake, then 1 to 2 days to boost creatine. Now one round of boosting is enough to get my head working again, so I really have almost no moments of fog and lethargy anymore! I'm basically fixed, and it's still a bit hard to believe that this was really the thing that's been my issue all these years...\n\n---\n\n\\* *They don't cite academic sources, but they're readable (though the second one is kind of messy), and you can verify anything you find by using search engines such as google scholar.*\n\nPosted on other subs too:\n\n- https://old.reddit.com/r/SCT/comments/ia51a9/what_worked_for_me_5mthf_creatine_and_glycine/?\n- https://old.reddit.com/r/hangovereffect/comments/ia517b/what_worked_for_me_5mthf_creatine_and_glycine/?\n- https://old.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ia4zlr/what_worked_for_me_5mthf_creatine_and_glycine/?\n- https://old.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/ia511w/what_worked_for_me_5mthf_creatine_and_glycine/?",

        "body": "Wow thank you for posting this, I recently started using creatine with glycine and noticed a huge energy boost mentally/physically, but despite that still have absolutely terrible anhedonia that keeps getting worse and only ever kinda goes away when I take adderall(not consistently though), and my brain fog never really seems to clear up. I've got a few questions. Your symptoms are pretty much just like adhd right? I haven't been officially diagnosed with adhd but I'm pretty sure I have it and my symptoms are a copy paste of yours so maybe these things may really help. Lastly any brand recommendations and can I take these effectively along with my standard supplements?(multi, fish oil, vit d/k2, probiotic, magnesium bisglycinate)",

        "body": "This is interesting--so, are there any particular signs you recognize when you've overdosed on methylfolate in particular?\n\nI've been tired all my life, quit caffeine about two months ago, went through hell for three weeks, and then had a week where it basically felt like I was on amphetamines the whole time, except in the most natural, pleasant possible way--I was studying for 14 hours a day indefatigably, and loving every moment of it. I was also finally sleeping for eight hours instead of ten, and waking up feeling rested, so I was sure that I had solved all my problems by quitting caffeine. It was pure hyperthymia, with no negative side effects whatsoever, and I was actually convinced that I'd get to live the rest of my life that way.\n\nThen I slowly began to feel like garbage again, and now I probably feel about as bad as I ever did before, with the quirk that I now suffer from inadequate sleep duration and wake up after about six hours, which is a problem I've never before experienced, and continue to  wake up feeling totally unrested as has been the norm for my whole life.\n\nIncidentally, I began taking Smarty Pants multivitamins, which contain 600mcg of methylfolate, at around the time I quit coffee, perhaps slightly before that. I wonder if my magical Ubermensch week post-caffeine withdrawal could have been the methylfolate supplementation honeymoon period I seem to have heard about. I've suspected I suffer from an MTHFR problem for a while, but hadn't given it a whole lot of thought lately until just now. I remember thinking \"Ah, it's methylated folate, so I should be okay\", apparently forgetting the fact that it's quite possible for MTHFR sufferers to overdose even on methylated folate.",

    "body": "hello! i've been deep in the world of asian skincare for a month now, and i thought i'd share my products and findings so far!\n\n**Source of products**: *1st picture* is a combination of products from unblemish and beauty bay. everything except the BoJ balm and cream on the far left are from unblemish, as well as the freebies in the bottom right corner! i'd fully recommend that site, it also has the best prices in the UK mainland from my findings. \n\n*2nd picture* are from TK Maxx, and the *3rd picture* is a bonus of how i store the products in a carry case i got from b&m bargains for £5 lmao\n\n**Me**: i'm 25, living in the UK so our climate is very mixed. when it's hot it's humid as hell, and when it's cold it's bitter. my skin however, remains oily! i am also very acne-prone, particularly on my cheeks. i think the cause of this is largely hormonal; i'm limited when it comes to birth control due to migraines, and also flat-out refuse to change my current birth control, and i cannot afford a private dermatologist, nor is it worth battling with GPs for derm care here. i've tried it, not worth it. i'd been prescribed a benzoyl peroxide & clindamycin cream before and it did a great job at getting rid of my spots and any nourishment and niceness in my skin, as well as destroyed my towels. the acne just came back when i stopped it too.\n\nmy aim is to manage my skin with skincare products - if i nourish it and treat it well, then hopefully i will have less problems. so far, one month in, i've had a small hormonal breakout, but otherwise my spots are under control, and my general skin condition is better than ever. the spots i get either never come to a head and disappear after a couple days, or are just little whiteheads. i no longer get painful, swollen welts on my skin like i used to. \n\nmore things: i am a picker. this is a habit i have drastically cut down on, but i need to eliminate it. i also don't wear foundation/complexion? makeup, only eye makeup & eyebrows, so i cannot comment on how any of these products work or look under foundation.\n\nother things i knew about my skin going into this is that it loves niacinamide, and it loves centella. so those are two ingredients i looked for in products. my skin isn't overly sensitive and it does generally tolerate most things\n\n**my routine**: you can probably see, i love a long routine. it makes my brain happy, i just enjoy applying everything. i do leave time between essence & serums, and serums & moisturisers. the AHA/BHA toner gets used 3 times a week, and the wash-off pack twice a week. i also planned to use non-AB 10% azelaic acid twice a week but the one i have brought i fuckin' hate so none of that for now. i double cleanse morning and night, cause... i like it and it controls my oil. i do NOT currently have a sunscreen which is super super bad, but i had to research a lot to find one i would likely like, and currently in the UK we don't have much sun or UV to speak of, plus i don't work, nor do i rarely go, outside. i have sunscreen on the way now!\n\nif not otherwise mentioned, all products used are AB and in these photos!\n\n*AM*\n- double cleanse, wash off with cold water\n- toner\n- non-AB 10% niacinamide serum\n- moisturiser\n\n*PM*\n- double cleanse, wash off with cold water\n- wash off pack if wash off pack night\n- toner\n- AHA/BHA here if AHA/BHA night\n- essence\n- serums. sometimes i layer, sometimes i don't\n- moisturiser\n\ni think that's everything... products and reviews incoming!\n\n**bold is the name of the products**\n*italics are the ingredients that stood out to me*\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Radiance Cleansing Balm**\n*ferments, rice extracts*\nfeels so luxurious to use each and every time, both packaging and product-wise. it's so nice to massage into my skin, and it collects and removes any dry flakes and general grit/dirt without being stripping. it also removes all my eye makeup and brows, including waterproof mascara, with little effort! i sometimes end up with a blurry eye for a minute or so after washing it off but given that it's not everytime i use it, i think the fault is in my technique rather than the product itself. leaves my skin feeling both clean and soft and like it's been 'conditioned'. i don't feel the need or even want to try any more oil/balm/first-step cleansers as this is so perfect for me, even if it's a bit pricey for how quick i get through it (1 month in and i'm just over halfway through my pot). HG and have already repurchased, 5/5\n\n**haruharu wonder - Unscented Black Rice Moisture 5.5 Soft Cleansing Gel**\n*ferments, rice extracts, ginseng, beta glucan*\nanother absolutely lovely product, in a similar vein to the radiance balm with the ferments and nice clean but non-stripping feel. foams up well but i do give it a good long massage onto my face so sometimes i dash a little extra water onto my face to keep it foamy. it's unscented but does still have a smell - just a clean skincare product smell, which i imagine is the surfactants, so it's very very subtle and inoffensive. would be another instant repurchase except unblemish was out of stock and stylevana wouldn't have it in stock for 30! days so i ordered a couple of different 2nd step cleansers to try. so still a HG, the only problem here is my own inpatience (and like, a need for some sort of cleanser for when this runs out) 5/5\n\nnote on the cleansers: i really think with the research i did and general luck that i ended up with a great combination of cleansers here. i think the ferments do play a good part in conditioning my skin, i was worried that they'd leave me with a negative reaction as they don't appear to work well for everyone but i'm glad i took the risk!\n\n**SKIN1004 - Madagascar Centella Poremizing Clear Toner**\n*centella, 'pink himalayan' salt, panthenol, 3x hyaluronic acids, salicylic acid, glycolic acid*\na semi-confusing one for me. it's a very good spot treatment - i have a horrible habit of picking spots when i get anxious, and if i hold a cotton pad with this toner on on top of the popped/squeezed spot, by the next morning the actual spot is gone and dried up and only little scabs and redness remain. but as a full face toner, it's just not hydrating enough, even with my oily skin, and honestly it's a bit stripping because i do use a LOT of toner (my bottle is almost empty after a month). looking at the ingredients and description it seems to want to do everything all at once, which is a tough goal to set yourself when you're only a toner. i also don't enjoy salt as a 'star' ingredient, i believe that's what leads to the stripping feeling, and it's a shame because there's SO many nice ingredients at lesser volumes than the salt in this and i feel like they don't stand a chance of working. i've brought some other toners to try, however i might repurchase this as i've never used anything so effective at nerfing a spot. MRP, 3.5/5\n\n**Dr. Ceuracle - Vegan Kombucha Tea Essence**\n*ferments, green tea, centella*\nso i went through a patch this month where the skin around my eyes was SO dry and sensitive, and this was the only thing that calmed it down and didn't sting. it feels like it calms my skin down almost instantly, especially in inflamed patches around spots. it's very rich, in both product and packaging, and the smallest amount goes a very long way. i've barely even made a dent in my bottle, but then i can only use it at night. why? it leaves a 'film' on my skin, like it's never truly soaked in, and this is something my oily self definitely does not need in the mornings. this is such a shame as everything else about it is so nice, and i wonder if maybe it's just not the best product for someone with oily skin. there isn't anything that controls oil in it, after all. it's also expensive LMAO but it's going to last me a ridiculous amount of time so it kind of evens out. MRP, 4/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Glow Serum**\n*propolis, niacinamide, centella, tea tree, betaine salicylate*\ni was expecting to love this one as it has niacinamide, but the main ingredient here is the 60% propolis and the niacinamide is formulated at only 2%. i use and reap the benefits of using a stronger niacinamide serum in the morning, and i enjoy a 2% boost in the evening, but the main component propolis here just does nothing for me. there's also 0.5% betaine salicylate which is a nice bonus but just isn't enough for an effect on my pores. the texture is fine, it's nice and i'll finish it, but i wouldn't repurchase as the main ingredient just doesn't seem to work or do anything for me WNRP, 2.5/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Revive Serum**\n*ginseng, snail mucin, niacinamide, licorice, 3x hyaluronic acids*\nmy first introduction to snail, it's only in a small amount here (3%) but i wanted to make sure my skin didn't react badly to snail before i went a brought a high% snail treatment. and it doesn't! my skin absolutely loved this serum and it's made me want to look at not on snail, but ginseng as well as main ingredients in my routine. it made my skin feel moist without being... oily lmao, and i also noticed texture improvements around my spots/scars/pores on my cheeks where my skin texture is the worst. It's also very non-sticky and thin and soaks in well! MRP but i'm going to buy seperate snail and ginseng products to try them more in depth first, 5/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Calming Serum**\n*green tea, mugwort, panthenol, centella, sodium hyaluronate*\ni've only used this a few times when my skin has been particularly angry, and it does what it says on the tin - overall calms inflammation and takes any sting out. i do need to use it more before i can post a conclusion and rating for it though! \n\n**Beauty of Joseon** - Glow Deep Serum**\n*rice extracts, alpha-arbutin, niacinamide, panthenol*\nhave not used this one yet! more rice extracts though which seem to work lovely on my skin, so i'm hopeful!\n\n**AXIS-Y - Dark Spot Correcting Serum**\n*niacinamide, squalane^, sodium hyaluronate, rice extracts, sea buckthorn*\nit doesn't do anything for me, atall, and something in it doesn't agree with my skin as i found that when i put it on my patches of acne, it not only didn't bring down an inflammation, but it brought up CCs around those areas. 5% niacinamide is not enough for me when my skin laps up and loves 10% on the daily. i applied this to areas where i have light scarring, dark spots etc. as well as patches where i had a spot developing and patches where spots were 'going away' and it did absolutely 0. glad i just brought the mini, WNRP 0/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Red Bean Water Gel**\n*red bean extracts, panthenol, beta glucan, 3x peptides*\nthis is really, really good at controlling sebum/oil throughout the day, and i can get very oily. it is a gel texture and doesn't feel like a moisturiser which i have mixed opinions about - like, i know it's a gel and not a cream, but i want my moisturiser to feel moisturising if that makes sense. i don't feel that it /adds/ any benefit to my skin, the benefit is in the oil control itself. definitely a gel for oily people and not those who are dry, 100%. i think it's great as a standalone moisturiser in my morning routine, but for my night routine i do want to add (and have ordered) a more hydrating and enriching (but NOT TOO RICH) cream. MRP, 4.5/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Dynasty Cream**\n*rice extracts, ginseng, niacinamide, squalane^, 3x hyaluronic acids*\nthis is a beautiful product but i'm not sure what tree i was barking up when i thought it was remotely for me and my skin. this is thick, rich and super hydrating and it's way way too much for my oily skin. it sits on my skin and in my pores - truthfully, if i look at my nose an hour or two after using this i can actually see the oil sitting in my pores - and it just doesn't seem to soak in all the way. i think it also worsened the spots on my cheeks when i used it, much like the axis-y serum. lovely around my eyes though and i have been putting the tiniest amount under them when the skin is sore and dry, and it actually cleared up the dry/red/damaged skin i had in the very far corners of my eyes in a couple of days, which is a testament to it not being a bad product, just the wrong product for me and my skin type. i'm never going to get through the pot if i use it as an eye cream though so i'm going to pass it on to my mum who will probably benefit from it. WNRP, 1/5 for my skin (type), not bad just not for me\n\n^ i'll be avoiding squalane in skincare for the foreseeable. process of deduction, it seems to be something that does not agree with my skin, especially acne/spot wise.\n\n2nd picture!\n**COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner**\n*glycolic acid, betaine salicylate, panthenol*\nthis was something on my list-to-by, even at full price. i've tried one AHA/BHA product before, the non-AB infamous 30% AHA 2% BHA peeling solution, and hated it because it just stung like crap and did nothing for my skin - now after researching, i know why! with oily, acne-prone skin i knew it was worth giving a more mild AHA/BHA product a go, and this came up as top choice. i love it, i use it 3x a week and even then it's already making a big difference. the first time i used it it seemed to make the pores on my forehead vanish, i've never looked so so smooth!! i really think this is helping to prevent my breakouts at the moment, even on my cheeks which are my main problem areas. it smells like it has alcohol in it which freaked me out a bit at first, but double-checking the ingredients, it doesn't! WRP 5/5, but might also look at different AB AHA/BHA products too\n\n**Mary & May Niacinamide + Chaenomeles Sinesis Serum**\n*chaenomeles sinesis (chinese quince), niacinamide*\nhaven't tried this yet, so no rating! i brought it to replace my non-AB morning 10% niacinmide before i realised it's only 2% niacinamide. i should read things before i buy them, but still it sounds like a great serum and i'll cycle it into my night routine at some point. it was £7, which is a bargain.\n\n**Mary & May CICA Tea Tree Soothing Wash Off Pack**\n*centella, tea tree, calamine*\nclay masks scare me - all of the western ones i've tried are stripping and drying as all hell. i saw this reduced at £6 and saw the centella in it and thought that if any clay mask is for me, it would be one like this. it is really, really nice, it has a fresh smell from the tea tree, it spreads on nicely and dries pretty quickly, and most importantly when i wash it off, i don't feel like i've sucked all of the moisture out of my skin. i'm only using it twice a week, not on AHA/BHA nights, and would probably not use it much more than that, but it's a nice way to get a boost of my much loved centella in my routine whilst still being a really good antidote for all of my oil and blocked pores with the tea tree. MRP if i find for a great price again, it's just not something i NEED in my routine, but it is a nice extra! also i want to try M&Ms other wash off packs lmao 4/5",

    "body": "Here are my thoughts on the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser & Kale-lalu-yaHa Exfoliant:\n\n\n**Cleanser:**\nThis cleanser doesn't have much of a scent which I love and contains some really awesome, skin loving ingredients. First, this contains matcha which is a potent antioxidant that helps protect the skin while hemp seed oil hydrates. Hemp seed oil is also high in linoleic acid and full of amino acids that heal, plump and protect the skin. Other ingredients include Vitamin B5 & Sodium PCA are skin strengthening ingredients that also help to hydrate. The cleansing agent in this formula is the coco-betaine, coco-glucoside & decyl glucoside which are a group of surfactants that are gentle at cleansing the skin without over-drying & protects the lipid barrier. I did pH test this and it tested about a 6.\n\nMy philosophy is that cleansing is one of the most important steps in any skincare routine. So, if you haven't guessed, I have tried my fair share of cleansers and I have to say, this cleanser is absolutely fantastic. This is a slightly foaming, gel cleanser that cleanses the skin thoroughly without stripping and leaves my skin incredibly soft and hydrated. It is also pretty concentrated, so you don't need to use very much. I am super impressed with the formulation and how well this works on my skin. I also love that this retails for $16 so it is extremely affordable. This has quickly replaced my former HG (holy grail) cleanser and I will keep repurchasing because it's just that good!\n\n\n\n**Kale-lalu-yaHa:**\nThis smells like a typical acid product, similar to Paula's Choice 2% BHA. This contains 5.25% glycolic acid as the exfoliating agent which is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) derived from sugar cane. AHA's are water soluble which means that they work on the surface of the skin. AHA's do not penetrate very deep into the skin and are best suited for removing dead skin cells that build up on the skin's surface. This also contains kale and other dark leafy greens which are potent antioxidants that are full of vitamins, minerals and nutrients. Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin B5, Allantoin and Aloe keep the skin hydrated and soothed. I did pH test this and it tested about a 4.5.\n\nSo the pH is around 4-4.5 which is a little high but can still exfoliate the skin. I personally think that this formula would be best suited for those with sensitive skin or those sensitive to acids. Also, this would be a great option for those just starting to get into using acids regularly. Since the pH is slightly high, this isn't going to be super strong, which I like because it doesn't cause any negative reaction on my sensitive skin. To use, I saturate a cotton pad and swipe my face, neck and upper chest and leave it on, no rinsing required. This does tingle which means it's working but dissipates quickly as it drys. Like the cleanser, this is very concentrated so a little goes a long way. After using this 3x per week for the past month, I can report that this is indeed a gentle exfoliating liquid that has kept my skin smooth, soft, a little more even toned and I have noticed by pores are less clogged. Although this isn't a BHA (an oil soluble exfoliant) that exfoliates the gunk that gets trapped inside the pores, keeping the surface clear of dead skin does help keep the pores from collecting that gunk in the first place. I hope that makes sense :) Again, this is a very gentle exfoliant and is a good intro for those new to chemical exfoliants. I would definitely repurchase!\n\nI do have a full blog post with more pictures [here](http://www.pdxbeautiful.com/2018/03/review-krave-beauty.html). ",

I never looked much into the lawsuit, and just warned people about the potential danger while moving on. \n\nHowever, I recently saw a post about DevaCurl products that spawned some.. conversation, and I ended up running into this comment, which piqued my interest. \n\n> “According to the lawsuit, propylene glycol and cocamidopropyl betaine are just two of the harmful ingredients included in DevaCurl products. The case claims the defendant’s products also include phenoxyethanol, Laureth-4, VP/VA copolymer, and Ceteareth-20, as well as a generalized “fragrance” that the suit says can typically be found in products that include artificial or harmful chemicals for such.”\n\n> Weird. I thought propylene glycol was found in many hygienic and cosmetic products…even Minoxidil (Rogaine). Wouldn’t that be counterintuitive?\n\nBetween this, and a [recent video from Manes by Mell](https://youtu.be/0-YXQMKH724) that I ran across while looking for information about the new Shark HyperAir, my curiosity was piqued, and I decided to [find some more information about the ingredients listed in the lawsuit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/wdm31g/look_what_i_found_at_tj_maxx/iilbaff/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\nI was disappointed to find that all of these ingredients are, in a handful of words, mostly harmless. Propylene glycol is basically used everywhere, and every other ingredient listed seems to just be commonly used in the cosmetics industry. The only specific ingredient that stood out (after **admittedly quick** skimming) was the phenoxyethyl. \n\nI’m not really here to defend or critique Deva Curl. Whoever wants to stop, or continue, using them for whatever reason can continue to do so. I, personally, never really used their products, and I only miss their Wash Day Wonder detangler, which basically is a detangling miracle for me.\n\nAll I’m here to do is share information that I hope people find useful. There are a lot of anecdotes going around, and I think it’s important to understand both why people are frustrated with Deva Curl products, as well as the facts about the lawsuit and ingredients. \n\nAs a counter anecdote, I listened to people here about the wonders of coconut oil, and used some for a period of time. It worked, but made my hair feel both slick, and dry. Turns out that a lot of Curly Girl/Guy suggestions don’t have the same effect on thick, fine, low porosity, hair like mine. If I hadn’t run into Mell’s video on coconut I could have ended up damaging my hair by listening the praise of an otherwise excellent hair fair ingredient that simply didn’t work with my hair type. \n\nIt is important that we listen to our hair, and research what we use, so that we can be informed about how we can care for ourselves.",

The daily hair loss is much less noticeable on daily washed hair and/or straightened hair. When someone finally starts treating their curls, washing far less often, not brushing or running fingers through their hair between washes, and finally having curls which hold in fallen hairs, they can get a bit shocked by the amount of hair that winds up in the shower drain.\n\nBut I never looked into the lawsuit, because I've never felt compelled to buy it. It's good to know though! If it ever piques my interest, I'll hopefully remember this, so I look further into the lawsuit. Thanks!",

It’s okay if you’ve decided not to use DevaCurl products for whatever reason, and I’m not here to tell anybody otherwise. \n\nMy only reason for making this post is to remind people to be careful what they hear online. **Even a product that has a 0.01% failure rate would still around 33,000 subpar units in the US**.\n\nWhile it’s important to listen to people who have had bad experiences, it isn’t enough to simply go on someone else’s word for *our personal* care routines and health choices. Some people may have been put off of DevaCurl products that would have otherwise found good success with them. Other people may have stopped using DevaCurl products when the only thing they needed to do was adjust their routine. Still others may never be able to use DevaCurl products because the change in formula is simply too much for their body to handle.\n\nI may chime in here and there with a few personal hair care experiences, but the main point I want people to take away from this post is that anecdotal experiences are not evidence. **Respect those who have had bad experiences with a product, but always do your own research into the things you buy so that you are not unwittingly spreading misinformation, or preventing yourself from using a product that may actually work well for you.**",

I began to get an incredibly itchy scalp (the person in the comments talking about ph seems onto something to me). I had tons of bleeding, scabs, dandruff, etc and it was pretty painful. After reading the horror stories I realized that deva had changed its whole product line and packaging to new stuff (the new green bottles) So I decided to experiment. I stopped using my old product (I used to buy in bulk so had a cabinet of product I was working through over the years) and bought all the comparable products from the new line and within a week all my itchy scalp issues went away. I suspect it had something to do with the no/low poo line ultimately. But I am happy with the new product line and have continued to use it for about 6 months now with no issues. \n\nI don’t know about the whole hair loss thing, but the scalp issues seemed to be true for me for the products made in that one window of time. I don’t know that ultimately it deserved all the panic and craziness online that it got, and deva likely should have been more transparent if they found issues with the product to explain what happened…. But regardless it seems the issue I saw was resolved in the new formulas. I saw some speculation that the clear bottles may also have had something to do with it. UV effecting the product, that seems possible I guess. Anyways, I’ve been happy with the new product line so for now I’m continuing to use it.",

If you just use a co-wash and the rest of the Deva line without clarifying for a long period (say, 2+ years) the buildup is going to cause scalp issues such as inflammation leading to hair loss, brittleness and dryness due to products no longer soaking in, etc.\n\nI had problems after using DevaCurl for years, but found that clarifying my hair once a month with a Sulfate shampoo (followed by a deep conditioner) helped a ton.\n\nAdditionally, symptoms like hair loss, itchy scalp, hair texture change, and dry scalp/hair are very vague symptoms that can be caused by a number of things. I'd have to see really concrete research and testing, with a control group and everything, to be convinced, personally, that it was Deva causing everything. Not to discount those who have had bad experiences - my heart goes out to you - but, I think nailing down a specific cause of such general symptoms is a more involved process than just reading a product label.\n\n So maybe it isn't the product themselves so much as the usage.",

Also people pick apart the ingredients on lists but forget to remember that some(most) ingredients work differently on their own vs in conjunction with another ingredient. I also just want to touch on the whole protein stigmatization: back in the day, animal protein was used as the only protein in products which produced a lot of over-proteinization. Nowadays, products are made with plant proteins which are much much gentler and it’s pretty much impossible to over-proteinize your hair.

    "body": "Review Day 1/7\nI recently purchased most of the new acne line by Pyunkang yul and I'm pleasantly surprised.\nUnlike the minimal ingredients the other lines have has these products contain a whole list of beneficial ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Licorice Root extract, Niacinamide, a peptide complex as well as many more. The star ingredients for this line is white willow Extract and Forsythia fruit extract. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Toner:\nIt's very watery so great for those with oily skin. It absorbs pretty quickly and has a sweet scent despite it not having any essential oils. After two weeks of using it I prefer the essence toner to it but it did help with the breakout I had and helped with clearing out my pores but it's not hydrating enough for me to see using in the long term. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser:\nMade with almost the exact same stuff but includes Citric acid and other agents for cleansing the skin. I'm not going to lie I love the cleanser it's so gentle and uses micro bubble technology. You might be disappointed that it doesn't lather well but I don't really care abut that aspect. It's a thicker consistency than their ato cleanser and 500ml cleanser but thinner than the foaming cleanser and has a pH of 5.5-6. My friend tested the pH on her one and she got a pH of almost 5.8. It also doesn't strip me of any moisture i feel more hydrated after cleansing. I'll definitely repurchase when I run out i prefer it over the Cosrx salicylic acid cleanser or my cereve hydrating cleanser. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Spot Cream:\nI got this for my sister but tried some myself I didn't really notice any difference on my skin but my sister who has sensitive acne prone skin saw improvements on her acne. I prefer to my a'pieu pimple patches over it. \n\nThis line is perfect for acne prone sensitive skin while people like me that has combo- dry skin might not like it as much it. \n\nEdit (I think their listed on cosdna if you want to check what is what) : Ingredients for the cleanser\nWater Cocamidopropyl Betaine Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate PEG-75 Acrylates Copolymer Glycerin Disodium cocoamphodipropionate PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Sodium Chloride Copper Tripeptide-1 Allantoin Citric acid Potassium Hydroxide Sodium Benzoate Phenoxyethanol Disodium EDTA\n\nIngredients for the toner:\nWater Butylene Glycol Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Niacinamide Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Glycerin Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\nSpot cream ingredients \n\nWater Pentylene Glycol Glycerin Behenyl Alcohol Cetearyl Alcohol Niacinamide Glyceryl Stearate Dimethyl Sulfone Silica Polyacrylate-13 Polyisobutene Polysorbate 20 Allantoin Madecassoside Asiaticoside Panthenol Pyridoxine HCl Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Xanthan Gum Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\n*For the cleanser and toner everything has an EWG rating lower than 3 these are all available in sale on style korean for $10 USD and under (shipping was dreadful to Canada its probably good if you live in the US) \n\nEdit x2? I just saw it on yesstyle too and they are doing a sale on the products as well . To clarify i broke out by using the moisture cream from this brand I added those products plus olivarrier products to sooth my skin. I'm planning on reviewing that brand later this week \n",

Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum.

I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

It seems like most of them aren’t even hiring proper chemists and cosmetic formulators but rather reading up on what’s popular abroad and DIYing in their kitchen because they believe the Indian consumer isn’t educated enough to check PH. so thanks for doing that. Also if one batches PH went wrong I hope they weren’t being cheap and informed the other people who purchased from that batch and refunded them. Or else they’re literally endangering those customers skin",

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

    "body": "This is my account of what worked and what didn't work with methane-predominant SIBO, nothing here is a medical recommendation or average treatment, it's just an account of my experiences.\n\nWith SIBO I realized that, even with the monitoring of a medical professional, it is necessary to study on your own, you need information to know what the doctor is doing, to know when it is time to change doctors, supplements, what works or not on the diet, but ultimately everyone must make their own decisions, however, what I can say is that knowledge is power.\n\nIt's impossible to put all the information about my experiences in one post, it would be huge, here's an organization of the path I took (which wasn't linear at all, there was a lot of suffering and many mistakes along the way).\n\nSorry for my possible mistakes in English, I'm not a native speaker.\n\nIn my research I found that SIBO in general is a bowel transit problem, so it makes a lot of sense to focus all efforts on improving bowel transit as much as possible. There are reports of curing SIBO just by fixing intestinal transit, because when we do that, we create an unfavorable environment for bacteria to remain in the small intestine. And this is what worked for me.\n\nSo it was necessary to know how bad it was and how to speed it up, here I will post the links that helped me.\n\nWhy you should focus on intestinal transit.\\\\/\n\n[https://youtu.be/sJSdWCGJD4Q](https://youtu.be/sJSdWCGJD4Q)\n\nVideo of the intestinal transit test. I also collected information about the quality of the stools, I made a spreadsheet with the time of the bowel movement and their quality using the Bristol scale, this is necessary to know if there has been an evolution in the digestive process as a whole, if the quality of the stools is not good , this is a bad sign from the big ones.\n\n[https://youtu.be/0Aj\\_RmdIHTw](https://youtu.be/0Aj_RmdIHTw)\n\nThis particular report changed everything for me about SIBO in general, because of all the ones I've seen to date, this was one of the ones I've seen that suffered the most, so it passed on a lot of valuable information that changed everything for me. I would say YOU should watch this one.\\\\/\n\n[https://youtu.be/53f1gsRUxvY](https://youtu.be/53f1gsRUxvY)\n\nMost of my problems came from very slow digestion, so here's the video that helped me the most. \\\\/\n\n[https://youtu.be/c1aVGlBUzOo](https://youtu.be/c1aVGlBUzOo)\n\nDiet\n\nI won't put my diet in the post because it's very individual, what I can say is that it was necessary to make a spreadsheet and test food by food, catalog each one by symptoms (no symptoms, average symptoms, bad/very bad symptoms), I used measures of 50\\~100g per food because I was suffering a lot from the symptoms and any change to more symptoms was a lot to tolerate, however, this part is very individual, everyone knows their own limit.\n\nIn this video there is everything about diets for SIBO, it helped me a lot. \\\\/\n\n[https://youtu.be/QnJf1YZwYok](https://youtu.be/QnJf1YZwYok)\n\nWhich supplements worked? I will not talk about dosage, it is individual, it depends on the case.\n\n\\- Betaine HCL\n\n\\- Artichoke Dry Extract + Ginger Dry Extract (these were the most important prokinetics, they were game changers for me, I use it before going to bed or on an empty stomach with a cup of coffee).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMental game:\n\nYou need to de-stress, my current protocol 1 hour meditation, 30 minutes yoga.\n\nYou need to stimulate the vagus nerve. Videos \\\\/\n\n[https://youtu.be/cYZmlO9STZ4](https://youtu.be/cYZmlO9STZ4)\n\n[https://youtu.be/MsQUBZR35xI](https://youtu.be/MsQUBZR35xI)\n\n SIBO is a marathon not a sprint, there are reports of people taking up to a year to heal, don't give up.\n\nMethod for collecting information and reaching conclusions about my case. \\\\/\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wekoon268mva1.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f7be9865f7b03e8838e3b127b439fea1c5a1ea0\n\n [http://confluencenutrition.com/roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDdSMjY0OGJDdDR2UUtnT0NLSjZiTVFZVjY3Z3xBQ3Jtc0tsbjV3RjJ6UVhxY3phbTRvZWYxNktFQnpocnBjc2d1dUhKbDVQeWVZeWljN3RGbEpIMGpTRDFPenI1SzN4M1c2VndRQlBxeTB0Y1lteXJFemphQUhOQlhQaU9qa2Z6VTBMc3liTnN3YTFBUXNJbXNsNA&q=http%3A%2F%2Fconfluencenutrition.com%2Froadmap&v=HGn1Boz0IxA)  /\\\\ Download the protocol in PDF",

I also use ginger and artichoke tea. I also think it has a lot to do with gut motility. What I found as well is that antibiotics deplete B vitamins especially B1 which is necessary for healthy nerves and gut motility. So am also going to try to add that.

    "body": "Hi reddit! I'm new so if this is the wrong sub, sorry! (sorry it's so long of a post!)  I've tried to work up the courage to post this for over a year... I'm desperate, so here goes.\n  \nSo here's the deal- I've had a rash for 5 years now. When it started it was just a tiny patch (about the size of a quarter on left hip, right where your jeans hit the front of your hip bone.) Then about 3 months pass, it's now on my right hip. Then the two slowly join. This lasts for oh, idk, another 2 years? **I went to a dermatologist and he cut a slice off and it came back with no growth.** Then I moved and lost health insurance. Spent the next 2 years with it slowly growing. July of last year (2014) it started to get REALLY BAD^bad^bad. It was on both boobs, side boob, hips, tops of buttcheeks. (It has only ever been in those places, plus my arms and back. No legs, hands, feet, etc ever) I had to 100% stop wearing bras, jeans, pants, shorts, tank tops. I barely could wear anything. I wore pajamas whenever I was home and could barely go to work anymore.  \n  \n[PICS](http://imgur.com/a/yUEr5) Probably NSFW, tho I did cover my nipples  \n  \nI moved again in fall 2014, stopped working because I couldn't put on clothes, got health insurance (thanks, Obama- seriously), and saw another dermatologist for 6 months. He was convinced it was **scabies**. (It wasn't.) Then he was convinced if we **froze the sores** it would kill them and I'd be free. *That shit hurts.* He finally gave up and sent me to an allergist.  \n  \nThis is about February or maybe March 2015 now. First visit she gives me steroids and the prick test on my back for trees, molds, animals, etc. I come up with **34 positive allergies.** Then, **she tells me I have a pressure allergy** and if I avoid all pressure inducing clothing, I should be ok. She also gives me allergy meds, sinus spray, and has me start allergy immunotherapy shots.  So no bras, underwear, tank tops, pajama bottoms with elastic, no jeans, no tennis shoes. Nothing. Loose, formless dresses and sandals.  \n  \nSince I'm still typing you can guess that didn't work. Still continued to break out all over. Saw a different, more experienced allergist. He still has no idea. Tells me there is no way it is pressure allergy, so good luck and that some patients can't find their cause for 5-10 years. I told him it's already been 5 and I am out of ideas. I see him 3 more times (each time having the same conversation- and he wouldn't even LOOK at my rash because it's on my boobs and hips and I can't wear bras/underwear without making the rash worse. I BEG him to please do a fabric patch test on my back to see if I am allergic to fabric. Every time I put on a polyester dress, I would break out like crazy. (I only wear 100% cotton now, but I'm still breaking out)   \n  \nHe finally does it and it was the worst weekend of my life. 80 samples were applied to my back and I broke out everywhere with one of the worst rashes I've ever had- but I couldn't apply steroids, take any steroids or  allergy meds... nothing. I sat there naked and drunk in front of the air conditioner and played WoW the whole weekend.   \n  \n**5 days later and I have 33 positive allergies, which grand totals 67 known allergies so far** Chemicals, medicine, metals, natural substances. I try asking what they are and they give me [data sheets](http://www.chemotechnique.se/products/national-series/north-american-80-comprehensive-series/) from the company that provides the allergen samples and tells me to Google it. I have Googled it.  \n\nI THINK it is propylene glycol, triethanolamine, and nickel. But I'm allergic to 30 more things and these 3 are damn near impossible to cut out of your life to test if it even is one or more of them that is causing the rash.  \n  \nBut the kicker? **I DON'T BREAK OUT AT THE SITE OF CONTACT.** During the patch test, within 2 hours my entire torso was covered again. I thought for sure when they took the patch off I would be scarred for life from all the hives under it, but there were just minor (level 1 and level 2) reactions to the allergens. Nothing else was different about that weekend with the patch test except the patches themselves.  \n  \nMy doctor refuses to do a patch a week to see when my rash flares up, so my question is: How to I pick which of the 33 chemicals to start with? A ton of them are in \"families\" so would I cut that whole family out at once? They are unable to answer basic questions about the chemicals themselves and just tell me to Google it.  \n  \n**My current state: I take Hydroxyzine every night, use steroid cream every day, shower 2x day using Yardley's sensitive skin soap, only wear 100% cotton dresses. No bra, no underwear, no socks. I don't work. I can't work out in public, or even in clothes. I have not had any 100% clear days for over 3 years. They itch like crazy, bleed, and go from nothing to scab without me even touching it. I AM DESPERATE FOR HELP SO I CAN MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE**\n  \nTest used was Chemotechnique Diagnostics North American 80 Comprehensive Series NAC-80.

        "body": "So, I've had some crazy allergy/immune system problems and what I've learned is that an allergist will find allergies, a dermatologist will find skin problems, an immunologist will find immune problems, and so on. Your allergist isn't the best person to have look for immune problems. An infectious disease specialist isn't looking for neurological problems. Get my meaning? \n\nI'm a perfect world, they'd communicate and work together, but that rarely happens. You kind of have to be your own health care coordinator. I think, if the allergist isn't helping (and it doesn't sound like they're providing a whole heap of help in general), then you should consider seeing another specialist. You rash may have nothing to do with your allergies. You might have to see a gp first in order to get referred to a specialist, for insurance reasons, but you'll need to check your policy to know for sure. \n\n\nA few things that jump out at me, though. You might want to check out dermatitis herpetiformis (which is a skin rash peopleomes in all kinds of different flavours) that is associated with celiac disease. Its important to note you need a *very* particular biopsy to diagnose this. You may or may not test positive for celiac through blood tests and intestinal biopsies may be negative. The reason I think DH is worth investigating is because you always get the rash on the same area, it's not affected by steroids or typical rash treatments, and it's incredibly itchy. The biopsy is tricky - they need to biopsy right beside an active lesion, not the lesion themselves. Good news, totally treatable with gluten free diet and, in extreme cases, leprosy meds which relieve symptoms quickly.  One way you can kind of see if this might be your problem is to either eat a lot of iodine or cut out iodine for a short period and see if it affects the rash. While exposed to gluten, a lot of people with DH have flares when they consume iodine. Weirdly enough, iodine stops being a problem when they're gluten free. \n\nBut it could totally be an allergy (of you can, find a new doc willing to explain how to avoid those allergens and answer your questions).  You should actually cut out *all* of your supposed allergies, and then work backwards. So, assume cutting everything cures your rash after a month. Then, you can slowly expose yourself to a new allergen, one at a time, and wait a while. The cause will trigger a rash, and you'll know what you have to avoid (we can test positive as allergic to things that don't cause noticeable symptoms, or aren't bothersome. Just because you tested positive doesn't mean you need to avoid it for life). You also want to Google everything you're allergic to and look for cross-reactive allergens. This is when you're allergic to something, say tree pollen, but also react to something unrelated, like a fruit, because both of the allergens are similar. These are a problem for a lot of people, and they go unnoticed because you may be tested for a common tree but not an uncommon fruit you happen to eat all the time.\n\n\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that an autoimmune disease or something else screwy can totally mess up your allergy test. The fact that your body is constantly breaking out could lead to false positives, for example. Or even false negatives. \n\n\nSo, tldr: go see another doctor (not necessarily another allergist), and let them approach the issue from their expertise. You might want to see your gp, an immunologist, a dermatologist, etc. Just because you have allergies doesn't mean the rash is caused by allergies, but your allergist won't look for anything else.",

Keeping a food diary is a good idea. Other random  tips I have, I really like aveeno, both the lotion and the body wash, it has oatmeal which is very calming for your skin. Also make sure your moisturizing enough. With as many showers as your taking your skin might be more sensitive without the protective layer of oil. You might also have your water tested to see if you have hard water. Think about other things that changed when you first started breaking out. Did you end up crappy ac and your sweating all the time now? Did you get a new mattress/sheets? How often do you change your sheets? You might have your bed checked for mites/bed bugs. I had a friend who got terrible rashes from dust mites. That's enough ranting for now I think, but let me know if you have any questions, I'll answer what I can, and good luck.",

Flash forward to this spring and tested positive for both Hydrogen/Methane SIBO, decided to try and treat it naturally. I’m not cured but I would say I’m 85-90% back to where I was and to keep things in perspective in a much better mental state. I hope this may at least help because I know what it’s like to relapse and I’m still a work in progress.\n\nThings that didn’t help - GI Revive, Motility Activator, restrictive diet, Betaine HCL/Ox Bile\n\nThings that helped - Creatine Monohydrate, Herbals, Walks after dinner, Florastar\n\nThings that have helped a ton - Zinc L Carnosine, MegaGuard by Microbiome Labs, L Glutamine, Exercise, taking off my garmin watch, ancestry DNA\n\n-I want to start off by saying, I took about 4 weeks of Allicin + Berbeine and then 2 weeks of Allicin + Neem. If I start to have flare ups again I’m going to go back with Berbeine + Anatril or Allicin + Anatril.\n\n-With a stressful job and 5 month old at daycare who ended up getting us sick I used that as a time to switch from the constant kill phase to a repair and rebalance phase…that’s when things started to improve.\n\n-Getting out of a constant flight or flight mode and be able to let your guard down and relax. Whatever makes you happy do it as much as you can and utilize that rest and digest time.\n\n-MegaGuard is a prokinetic but it also has DGL which combined with Zinc L Carnosine does a great job at coating the digestive track and may calm down inflammation. L-Glutamine on an empty stomach combined with Creatine Monohydrate helps gut lining repair along with improved cognitive function/ATP production which is an issue with SIBO.\n\n-One of the biggest tools, I took an ancestry DNA test and uploaded my raw data to genetic lifehacks. I learned I have a genotype which reduces methylation along with low DAO which breaks down histamine in foods. Basically it confirmed the need for methyled B vitamins and the need for me to continue on a low histamine diet.\n\n-Over the last few years especially when these gut issues started I started getting health anxiety and my fitness watch became something that would define my day based on my heart rate, or sleep score, or stress level…I took it off and I feel so free again.\n\n-A major component, exercise…I struggle with constipation and my issues are ALWAYS worse during winter. Why is that? I’m not active and I’m not getting sunlight.\n\n-Last but not least and to be candid, I’m still scared to take probiotics, I hear horror stories…I ended up taking Saccharomyces Boulardii (Florastar) realizing that it’s not necessarily the answer but rather mercenaries that with a balanced diet and targeted prebiotics on occasion will help crowd out the bad bacteria.\n\n-For the longest time I was limiting what I ate to a handful of foods knowing that it wasn’t solving the problem, but just getting by. I’m aiming to eat at least 8-10 different (veggies/fruits/nuts) every day. The more variety the better. I am still limiting gluten, dairy, and sugar where I can.\n\nI’m still a work in progress, I’m sure I’ll continue to have flare ups. What I’m doing now is trying to focus on the good and not the bad and knock on wood that seems to be helping.\n\n",

Almost died from last year,have spent thousands, have researched thousands of hours , and I still KNEW in my GUT (lol) that I was missing something,Finally I noticed poor motility was my most critical problem, started int. theraputics motility activator,\n\nDEVELOPED GALBLADDER LIVER UNDER RIGHT (sometimes left too) rib cage pain, God even had a girl in NORWAY contact me here in east coast usa after she saw my gut health videos, and she was 100% obsessed about gall baldaer and bile, She rubbed off on me,I went to Justin health after trying 4 years with 2 other naturopathic/functional doctors , plus the very unhelpful 15 conventional doctors, He had me start enzymes HCL and OX BILE.Well I didnt tolerate his \"liver support\" due to overmethylation, (betaine, beets, etc CRUSH me , horrible insomnia and hyperstimulation)I started BILEX brand ox bile, 3 tabs each meal, been on it two weeks, After over a SEVERE year of sibo, I can finally eat, and have ZERO bloating, and i am finally healing, have appetite and am being cured.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have tried 100's of things , literally, I have 200+ supplement bottles behind me after learning magnesium and diet cured my fibromyalgia in 2014. It will be 10 years next year. I new natural medicine cured other condutions and I knew I had to keep seeking. God answered my prayers, I almost died, sooo very close last year, closer than I have ever been, and I even had lung blood clots in 2012.God saved me with natural medicine,My GI map stool tests saved my life too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had 6 overgrowths, severe candida , citrobacter, proteus, leaky gut, low secratory iga. etc. Nothing I took or ate helped.Now I know why. I wasnt digesting fats, and so I couldnt have bile , fats, or EXCRETE FAT SOLUABLE TOXINS, so I could never handle the DIE OFF.Also have lyme and mold. Doing Monolaurin now while I work with justin on adrenals and digestion, then we will do full fledge kill then repopulate phase. THANK YOU GOD I CAN EAT AGAIN.\n\nIf you TRIED EVERYTHING, and spent thousands, over years, you may want to make SURE you have foundation, 3 things\n\nHCL (if you cant tolerate like me, tasty tonics bitters tonic orange vanilla is AWESOME!!!!!) ,\n\nenzymes, 3-5 capsules of something like ENzymedica digest complete with meals I do\n\nAND \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* OX BILE \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* my miracle straight from God....I use Bilex brand Douglas Laboratories.\n\nI am now having MUCH less die off (fat soluble toxins NEED BILE to leave body) My under rib cage pain ended in 1 day after starting bile and in 3 days was perfectly fine, I can eat almost any meat fruit veggie fat without problems. I am now using bathroom without BOTTLE AND BOTTLES of Mag 07 / Oxy Powder magnesium oxide. I feel my whole life changing and I am thankful for every bite of food and when i get hungry and use restroom now.  Such a blessing to be hungry and eat and feel the energy from the food, instead of nausea , headache , brain fog, bloating and just bowels not moving at all.  \n\n\nBile and ezymes can give some mild die off headache, but I am able to tolerate it much better. Mag 07 can be taken during severe die off to flush all junk out of bowels , I do 4 capsules at night before bed and lots of water if I eat tons of bile in a day or monolaurin and lots of foods that may still be iffy, but I am 80% better. 3 weeks ago I had liver/galbladder pain, a few teaspoons of fat would make me nauseas, and none of this started UNTIL i took \"motility activator\" artichoke and ginger, and I am glad I did so that it would show me the galbladder and bile deficiency was the cause. God worked it out cause I was brain fogged and half brain dead past months/years from the deficiencies and infection.   \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* ALSO, YOU CAN TAKE ALL THE HERBS TO HELP \\*BILE FLOW\\* but if you CANNOT MAKE IT , YOU MUST SUPPLEMENT ACTUAL BILE INSTEAD, so fresh bile goes into intestines, break down fat, wash away bacteria , activate peristalsis , and THEN ABSORB INTO last part of small intestine and go through portal vein into the liver and bile ducts.   It's like magnesium deficiency, You can take all herbs to calm you and help you on the earth, but nothing will cure the root cause except magnesium and magnesium rich foods. I hope my life experience helps you.  All the pain and almost dying, I hope everyone of you heal \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nThis is not medical advice but only for educational purposes.\n\nHere is some great info that helped me!\n\nAlso! Here is the digestive support guide which was life-changing for me. The liver support is actually the ox bile cause I couldn’t tolerate deliver support due to overmethylation and methylated products in it. \n\nhttps://justinhealth.helpdocs.com/supplements/digestive-support-guide\n\nHere are some great informational links\n[https://www.ambersnaturalnutrition.com/how-poor-bile-production-and-flow-can-cause-sibo/](https://www.ambersnaturalnutrition.com/how-poor-bile-production-and-flow-can-cause-sibo/)\n\nJustin mentions me in this video.

Photos 5 and 6 are from an Orang County, CA TJ Maxx. Stores are clean and organized.\n\nHAUL and mini review: (dry/dehydrating/30/Socal)\n\n**Laneige cica sleeping mask $20 60 mL**. My ride or die cica cream that I always need to have in stock. I ran out in March and was gonna buy more on my Japan trip, but couldnt find it in Japan. I didnt really wanna deal with the shipping and tariffs mess with online retailers so I intended to buy it whenever theres a sale at my local Amorepacific/Aritaum store. Regular price is $34, I was hoping to snag it on a 30% sale for \\~ $25, but TJ Maxx selling it for $20 is fantastic. Even Stylevana only has it on sale for $24 right now. I was devastated that this TJ only has 1 in stock. \n\nMini review: Nothing soothes my skin the way this cica cream does it, especially on hotter days.

    "body": "Hey everyone, I have been suffering from a type 2 hiatal hernia of approximately 3cm for a long time, which was causing daily acid reflux and LPR.  This caused frequent lung and sinus infections, constant throat / esophageal pain and burning, coarse voice, mucous, and, in general, made my life a misery. I couldn't sleep, eat, run, swim, live.  I fell into depression when the symptoms got worse approximately 3 years ago.\n\nI researched the topic daily for years and tried almost every non-surgical cure, so I want to share some tips that helped me heal by 90%+. I claimed my life back, and I hope the same for you. The order is random.\n\n1. No meals 4 hours before sleep\n2. Sleep on your left side.\n3. Breathwork before and after every meal. Box breathing works well.\n4. Eat slowly, consciously and chew well\n5. Check your stomach acidity, and use Betaine HCL if its low before every meal. Take up to 5 capsules if needed. and slowly scale it back once your stomach gets used to produce more acid\n6. Check your bile flow function, and take bile salts if needed. Green beets or extract help too. As with HCL, gradually decrease the dose once digestion improves.\n7. Massage your guts and abdomen after food.\n8. Diaphragm strengthening breathwork\n9. Prioritize sleep, 7 hours minimum. Avoid any devices 3 hours before sleep\n10. Walk daily, ideally 20-30 minutes after each meal.\n11. iQoro may help too, use it every time before meals.\n12. Control your stress levels. Meditation and prayers does wonders\n13. Affirm daily to your self for 10 minutes that will get better no matter what. Believing in your healing is ESSENSIAL.\n14. Light daily workout for 30 minutes, but avoid heavy weights.\n15. Drink one glass of warm water every morning on an empty stomach, and then do 2-3 sets of hill drops. Wear your trainers while doing so to avoid damaging your ankle.  Mild trampoline may help too, but don't over do it.\n16. Last, but most important to me is DIET. The diet that worked best for me is a zero-carb carnivore/lion diet. That includes only grass-fed ruminant meats (beef, lamb, goat, bison), and  butter. Once my body healed I started adding GRADUALLY small doses of other animal based food like hard cheeses, goat kefir, eggs, fish, lard ertc. From vegetable sources, the best way to start is with sourkraut and kombucha..  Eventually you may choose to add more food variety like more vegetables, but prefer low carb, and low FODMAP veggies only. I would personally avoid all grains, and seed oils forever. Fruits are also a no-go for me but give them a try if want, after you heal most of symtoms and see how it goes.\n\nThat''s my basic routine, I hope it helps some of you. This is NOT medical advice though.\n\nSadly I don't have the time to discuss each and every point in great detail, but you can use those tips as a reference point to do your own research and figure if it works for you and why.",

There are many sufferers who have enough acid or even too much acid.  \nRegarding the last point, you don’t need to be on a ketogenic or carnivore diet to control reflux. In fact the opposite is good in my experience and based on the literature I read. Ketogenic food is generally harder to digest in general than vegetables, and the food stays much longer inside the stomach, demanding it produce more acid. Also, ketogenic diet can be vegetarian as well. I follow an omnivore diet, treatin eating mostly vegetarian and fully controlled my LPR doing each one of the other points except 5, 6 and 16. \n\nExcept for those points, good summary.

I have had this issue for a long time now....I am in my 50's and have had it since I was a teen. It has caused me so much trouble, emotionally, health wise, financial wise, on SO many levels. Since several bad experiences in my 20s with medical doctors, where I had no help at all, I have turned alternative, and still at this date I struggle with this. I use lots of herbal medicines, for my circulation, digestion, etc....eat pretty healthy....I try to stay somewhat low carb, but I might need to try your carnivore thing, although this is HARD.. The thing that bothers me most about it all is what it does to my sleep. I have a hard time breathing through the tight feeling in chest to get enough, and I often get bloated late in the day, so it is an ongoing issue. NO sleep is a disaster!..Ok, I am going to try a combo....carnivore and GAPS...because the broth is healing.  Also, agree on the rest of your advice....especially meditation! I would add trying some hiatal hernia manipulations with a visceral manipulation therapist or osteopath, although doing some bringing down the stomach yourself might help a bit, not me, but some people.. I wonder about people who try surgery...has anyone heard the success rates? Surgery sounds kinda terrifying though. One question.....did you take any herbs or other  supplements when doing the restrictive diet? I think I will try it, butI still have lots of things that I never thought of...like THC gummies,  kombucha, vodka in my tinctures, other supplements: enzymes, ACV, glutamine, spirulina, fish oil and more.",

Back in college I gained 40 pounds and looked great, but have had the hardest getting back to my peak after losing 25 pounds since.\n\nI realized that I have low stomach acid (a side effect of my chronic hypothyroidism) that has lead to protein malabsorption. Worse is the fact that protein that isnt digested properly is actually toxic to the body.\n\nAnyway, after supplementing my meals with Betaine HCl (NOT Betaine TMG) w/ Pepsin, my digestion has improved and I have *significantly* more energy.\n\nHappy gaining\n\nEDIT: It's possible that what I was suffering from was indigestion and not low stomach acid, who knows.

    "body": "One of the biggest mistakes I see on these boards are people starting by trying to kill their SIBO. For some, that will work, it generally means you don't have relapsing SIBO. But for most, SIBO will be coming back even as you kill it, because something in your gut just isn't working right.\n\nIf something isn't working, you need to fix it first. Unfortunately, that may mean taking something with each meal or daily for life. It doesn't mean that things like stress avoidance or diet aren't worthwhile, but they most likely won't truly fix your mechanics. Something is wrong, and it needs to be amended. For example, diet is great for avoiding symptoms, but in the end it won't fix your mechanics, only avoid triggering them. But if your car doesn't turn left, best bet is to take it into the shop, not just avoiding left turns all your life.\n\nI have a protocol that helps to identify what's going on in my pinned posts, but if you just want to figure it out for yourself, below are the biggest tools for the job.\n\nIt can be tough to know what your mechanical issue is, my suggestion would be- test stuff out, and don't be so certain until you're absolutely certain.A lot of people thnk they know what their mechanical issue is, but my suggestion would be- don't be so sure until you actually fix it. Stubbornly following a self-diagnosis or a theory can make you miss what's really going on.\n\nFor example, Motility comes up often. Sure motility is a big one, in fact the only really proven what at this stage. But a quick look through SIBO success stories will show you a lot of people who've found more help with stomach acid, bile, or just treating dysbiosis.\n\nMOTILITY AGENTS  \nGet stuff moving. Keep in mind nearly EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE motility, because when your gut doesn't work correctly, things move slower. As in, a bowling ball will have a hard time going through a hose, but the problem is that it's a bowling ball. You might assume you have a motility issue, but don't put all your money on it until you've tried some others as well.\n\n\\-Artichoke and Ginger supplements (Gut Motility, Motility activator, etc.): works, but tends to have a short efficacy, a couple months for most.  \n\\-Prucalopride: needs a prescription, works more on the lower end of the gut, works great for a lot a lot of people  \n\\-Mestinon: more muscular, tends to work on the upper portion of the gut more  \n\\-Fibers, such as Fibercon/Calcium Polycarbophil (does not feed bacteria, unlike other fibers.)\n\nNERVE-CENTRIC MOTILITY AGENTS:Tend to stimulate your nerves in digestion, such as the Vagus one everyone's always talking about  \n\\-Thiamine (benfo, TTFD, Allithiamine, HCL): Probably one of the most overlooked yet one of the best success rates on these boards  \n\\-MSM: works for some, never tried  \n\\-Myo-Inositol: A central nervous system support supplement, helps a lot if you have nerve damage or neuropathy\n\nSTOMACH ACID:Probably one of the most common reasons for SIBO, especially if you were ever on PPIs  \n\\-Betaine HCL  \n\\-Apple Cider Vinegar-Zinc (long term use can help)\n\nPANCREATIC ENZYMES:  \n\\-Creon: Prescription, super strong, mostly unecessarily strong  \n\\-Spectrazyme 9x, Theragest, others: Any pancreatin supplement can generally do the job for most people\n\nWIDE SPECTRUM ENZYMES:  \n\\-Millions of brands, some of my favorites being VeggieGest, Truvani, Silver Fern, and Dr. Mercola\n\n\\-Enzymes to look for:  \nInvertase: Starches  \nCellulase: plant fibers  \nAlpha Galactosidase: Beans and gassy stuff  \nBromelain: a plant enzyme and digests nearly anything  \nTrypsin: An enzyme produced in the small intestine\n\nDIGESTIVE AGONISTS:  \nThese help stimulate the digestive system to work on it's own, giving it a litle extra push. Generally bitter supplements, they push the digestion into overdrive and help increase gut secretions  \n\\-Bitter Melon  \n\\-Gravol Ginger (specifically this brand, there are many ginger supplements, but I have yet to find any that do what this one does due to it's proprieatary combo)  \n\\-Gentian Bitters  \n\\-Tryphala  \n\\-Wormwood\n\nFODMAP AND FOOD SPECIFIC ENZYMES:\n\nFor those with specific food intolerances, these can help target what you're missing.  \n\\-Fodmate  \n\\-Fodzyme  \n\\-Intoleran (has a variety based on what your specific needs are)  \n\\-Lactase: For dairy issue\n\nBILE:  \nIf you have yellowish stool or a hard time with fats, this is likely a candidate:  \n\\-Ox Bile  \n\\-Tudca\n\nSTOMACH LINING/GUT WALL  \nOften in disrepair after long periods of gut issues, and especially after food poisoning. Repairing it can help, extremely messed up lining becomes Leaky Gut. These all tend to help with repair.-  \nL Glutamine  \n\\-NA Glutamine  \n\\-Zinc Carnosine  \n\\-Glutamic Acid\n\n\\-Butyrate: normally produced by fiber/bacteria\n\nDYSBIOSIS:  \nSometimes you just don't have the right bacteria, but nothing is really wrong per se with your digestion. Another that can be overly assumed. You might have dysbiosis, but the reason you do is likely something else entirely. This is far from an exhaustive list.  \n\\-Probiotics such as VSL3 or Visibiome  \n\\-Akkermansia  \n\\-L. Reteuri probiotic  \n\\-L. Gassieri  \n\\-Prebiotics  \n\\-Kefir (probably the best starting point for most.)\n\nChances are one of your gut issues is one of these. There are others, but these are the mains.\n\nBest of luck.",

Could you please read the text below and tell me what you think? \n\nI have SIBO and MCAS. When I tried a diet of animal fats and protein only, I hardly had any symptoms but still low-grade inflammation (in addition to typical MCAS sensitivities), so the problem was still obviously there. On this diet, I only had bowel movements once a week, but no bloating or any discomfort whatsoever. It wasn't sustainable though.\n\nWhen I include plant food in my diet I have daily bowel movements, but carbs like white/sweet potatoes, onions, beans & lentils make me bloat and burp. Anything with high starch or high sugar like potatoes and most fruits also gives me stinky and mushy stools. Beans, seeds, nuts, however, give me perfect stools but make me feel absolutely awful (bloated plus very inflamed). I also don't tolerate most vegetables and fibers. \n\nIntermittent fasting (2 meals a day) and drinking water only helps manage my symptoms. Also, one tablespoon of homemade kimchi a day (fermented for 2 weeks) helps me tolerate some plants foods better. Addionally, when I started adding cayenne pepper to my kimchi my hair loss suddenly stopped. I could also suddenly tolerate potatoes and onions better, and without increased inflammation, as long as I eat them not more than once every 3 days.\n\nWhat do you think my root cause is? It would be great if you or anyone else could point me to the right direction. I'm leaning towards SIBO/dysbiosis and leaky gut. In case of the latter, I don't know how to heal it because I can't tolerate any supplements yet due to my MCAS. Not even sprinkles.",

I thought it was bs cos I thought they meant it was leaking out the walls into the body, as that was what my sister was suggesting, but all it means is that bacteria and other things that are normally stopped from getting out of the gut into the bloodstream aren't being blocked by the gut lining. \n\nHe did confirm that leaky gut syndrome is a bullshit condition and said to only go to dietitians for diet plans, not nutritionists. Also, he used a great comparison with the difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist—the former is a medical professional who can prescribe medication, the latter, while often college educated in nutrition/psychology, but isnt qualified to prescribe medication, so in the case of nutritionists, they'll sell you supplements.",

        "body": "Looking at this as a gut microbiome researcher, I see stuff that credibly could work, though I am unsure if any of it has been proven to work effectively enough to be licensed for medications. That may mean that, in the case of a heterogeneous condition where there is not as yet a single good explanation (which is true for a lot of chronic stuff), it will help a little in some, a lot in some, and not in some. Betaine/pepsin degrades protein; together with the DAO as a whole this is intended to reduce excess histamin, and goes of a somewhat interesting theory that histamin (which is what anti-allergy pills suppress) is part of hyperinflammatory conditions; in this case in the intestine. Am not 100% sure on the omnilactis/colon balance/glutamine but it may be stool softeners, making for smoother passage, better water balance (against either diarrhea or constipation) or the like. Ozovit is also against constipation/bloating.\n\nSo what I'd say is:\n\n\\- It is not quack stuff, not homeopathy or herbal or the like.\n\n\\- It is not prescription-only medication, though if they had been synthesized first before discovered in plants (daosin, betaine, pepsin) they might have been.\n\n\\- It instead formally counts as supplements, but there are credible mechanisms of action for helping with inflammation and/or histamin intolerance associated gut disorders there.\n\n\\- There may or may not have been clinical trials, I am just too tired to search to check. Probably some and I assume they showed weak positive results.\n\nI am not a medical doctor, but I do research health impact of the gut microbiome. My expectation would be that these likely would help against the inflammation-associated gut symptoms. My read so far also is that histamin intolerance is underresearched but I suspect when we do run the studies, we will find it a relevant factor.\n\nAs for perimenopause: when your estrogen declines, this causes immune dysregulation (possibly due to the change rather than to the absolute level, I am not sure if we know) which would affect overall inflammatory response which in turn would exacerbate histamin intolerance.\n\nSo my response would be, actually more or less legit, if a bit experimental. In part because the field is not so well researched overall - these conditions were previously often just dismissed as psychosomatic.\n\nI would try this.",

This sub has helped me so much, so I really wanted to give something back and give you guys some hope and my regiment of what has helped me.\n\nBeing bedbound, Heavy fatigue, PEM, extreme digestive issues, brain fog, dysautonomia. Its mostly all gone. I can go to the gym 3 times a week again, go for runs, work on my music, meet up with friends. In the first months I went from totally active athletic fit to completely underweight because I couldnt eat anything. It was rough.\n\n**So what helped me?** I tried pretty much everything, and the most important was definitely TIME. After about 4-5 months I started getting better slowly\n\nBut there are some things I have seen progress with, these are:\n\n**Salt and Electrolytes (10/10 would recommend)**  \nI still take about 5-8G Sodium, 4-6G Potassium a day. It helps me retain water and not be dehydrated.\n\n**Keto (10/10 would recommend, just beware of keto flu ->** **more electrolytes)**   \nGet those Carbs out of your life. A lot of people seem to have not functioning glucose metabolism, and forcing the body to switch to fat metabolism has helped me extremely. Stopped the fckery with my blood sugar and energy levels.\n\n**Betaine HCL & Digestive Enzymes (9/10)**   \nGodsend for my digestive issues, I definitely had low stomach acid and problems absorbing nutrients.\n\n**Stopped being vegan and ate a ton of meat (10/10, duh)**   \nWhile I wouldnt say I am carnivore, I just dont eat vegetables a lot since they still upset me a bit and meat/organs is more nutrient dense anyway.\n\n**Creatine (10/10)**   \nDefinitely helped with water retention, dehydration was a big one for me\n\n**Giving a shit about doctors, friends & family that dont believe you (69/10)**   \nI have experienced a ton of gaslighting like others here, and while their intentions maybe were good, they have done more damage than they think. Being bedbound for 6 months is no joke, and my mind was the only thing pushing me through. Being told its all in my head is the absolute worst you can hear, so fck them. They will understand when it hits them personally.\n\n**Glynac, Cordyceps, LDN (?/10)**   \nThese are all fairly new in my routine, so I cant give em an exact reward in healing. Maybe they helped, maybe they didnt.\n\nI tried lots of other stuff like glutamine, high dosing all the vitamins, omega 3, you name it. this is what helped me most tho.\n\nGood luck everyone, I think there is a good chance everyone will heal.",

It’s great to finally have a community only dedicated to Dollar Tree beauty products. Hurray for the appreciation for these items! \n\nHere’s some old (may not be able to find) and newer products that I’ve enjoyed and recommend. With some other products I’m less enthusiastic about but think some may still find useful for a short review. \n\n**For some background**: I’ve followed the videos and content of dermatologist Dr Dray (who visits Dollar Tree saying what’s good—she recommended the Kissable Foot Cream for instance). as well as watched a lot of skincare research videos by the two cosmetic chemists of [Chemist Confessions](https://youtube.com/@chemistconfessions?si=UOUzd8RbKlnA6VrE). Highly recommend their often very in-depth videos by the way (clinical research studies!). They are very fun and educational to watch! \n\nWith this background in mind, I’ve shopped Dollar Tree beauty with a mind on trying out interesting and effective ingredients on a budget. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, acne prone, dehydrated. Some dryness during winter and with overuse of actives. \n\n##Miscellaneous health & beauty: \n\n_Medicine_\n* **Valu Health Non-drowsy daytime cold & flu/nighttime cold & flu acetaminophen soft gels** - As good as DayQuil/NyQuil for fever and cold. Excellent for travel. Conveniently color coded orange (daytime) and green (nighttime). \n\n_Toothpaste_\n* **Colgate Complete Protection Sensitive** - Pleasant mild mint perhaps similar to Sensodyne or Trident Spearmint gum. 5% potassium nitrate calmed my intense tooth aches before seeing dentist. In fact my dentist gave me just this toothpaste before. Tip: Use for two weeks before applying tooth whitening strips or gel to reduce sensitivity. \n\n_Deodorant:_\n* **Suave deodorant energizing sport** - Has aluminum (chemically blocks sweat). Works for summer body odor. Masculine scent. Can leave white marks on dark clothes. \n\n##Body wash, shampoo, hand soap:\n\n_Body wash_\n* **Arm & Hammer Ultra Moisturizing Body Wash** - Best consistency of the Dollar Tree body washes I’ve tried. Not runny; a regular gel. The unisex scents appeals to whole family but men especially. \n* **Power Stick Shower Gel Santal Woods** - Too runny. But nice smell. “Santal” means sandalwood but I also smelled cedarwood. Like Bath and Body Works Cedarwood Sauna perhaps. Unisex; appeals to men. \n\n_Shampoo_\n* **Pro Silk Moisturizing Shampoo Moroccan Argan and Coconut Oil** - Too runny. Builds up over time. Will need a clarifying shampoo with it. Appreciate the extra large 32 oz value size. \n* I generally like V05 or Suave for clarifying shampoo if they come with sulfates. \n\n_Hand soap:_\n* **Dermasil Extra Moisturizing Hand Wash** - Moisturizing and silky like Dove hand soap. A subtle cherry almond scent. \n* **Soft Soap Milk and Honey** - Moisturizing and gentle on hands. Pleasant, mild scent. \n* **Dial Moisturizing Hand Soap Vanilla Honey** - Similar to Soft Soap. Gentle on hands as promised. My dentist’s office uses a similar one. This is not antibacterial but antibacterial hand soap is not needed for most people and actually can lead to bacteria gaining resistance against cleaning agents. Pleasant, mild scent. \n\n##Body care \n\n_Body balms:_\n* **Personal Care 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly** - Apply on minor cuts and bruises to help prevent scarring. Use occasionally in skincare for an extra occlusive layer (“slugging”). Daily overuse can make skin lazy though. Alternatively try Aquaphor, Cerave ointment or a face oil. Slight waxy smell. \n* **Xtra Care Revitalizing Body Balm Jelly Stick** - Very firm, drags. But is unscented and not the worst.\n* **Kissable Diabetics’ Dry Skin Treatment Foot Cream** - 1% Dimethicone (similar to La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm B5) and 30% petrolatum. More of a healing balm than a lotion. Stiff textured. But has effective strengths of active ingredients. Fragrance free. \n\n_Body lotion:_\n* **Kissable Diabetics’ Dry Skin Relief Lotion** - An excellent body lotion similar to Vaseline Intensive Care. A bit more fluid. Not as fluid as Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion but also more moisturizing. Simple ingredients (no ceramides), no irritants, fragrance free. \n* **Xtra Care Diabetics’ Hydrating Lotiom Dry Skin Relief** - Similar to the above Kissable Diabetics’ Dry Skin Relief Lotion. Simple ingredients, fragrance free, nice texture. Note: Was **recalled** once. \n* **Dermasil Eczema Relief Body Lotion** - Good consistency. Some soothing plant extracts and oat extract (but not to active ingredient levels). Has graveolens oil for fragrance. Imparts a sweet, herbal, earthy scent like chamomile. Liked ok. \n\n_Hand cream:_\n* **Care All Creamy Petroleum Jelly** - 30% petrolatum. An excellent hand cream much thicker than Vaseline Intensive Care, great for dry winter hands. But does smell _intensely_ like baby powder. 30% petrolatum functions as a skin protectant similar to the 40% petrolatum in Aquaphor or Cerave Healing Ointment. \n* **Udderly Smooth Hand Cream Original Formula** - The fastest absorbing hand cream I’ve found! Impressed a nurse friend. Was developed to quickly moisturize chapped cow udders. \n\n##Face products \n\n_Face cleanser & cold cream:_\n* **Skin Nutrition Botanicals Tea Tree Oil + Salicylic Acid Balancing Face Wash** - Very good, non-stripping formula with gentle but effective cocamidopropyl betaine (coconut derived). Have used both day and night. Tea tree oil can have an anti-acne effect similar to benzoyl peroxide. Perhaps can leave on skin like a mask before washing off? Does not state percentage of ingredients so assume the salicylic acid is below 1%. \n* **B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream** - Dislike this formula and intense powdery scent. But does work surprisingly well as a cold cream cleansing balm to remove makeup. \n\n_Face lotion, eye cream:_\n* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Eye Cream**, 0.5 oz - excellent silky smooth consistency like a more expensive serum. Has peptides but can’t say I noticed an effect. Squalane is the most non-comedogenic of oils \n* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Skin Cream (jar)**, 1.7 oz - the same as the eye cream in consistency but more product! Similar ingredients such as peptides and squalane too. Topical collagen is not really helpful in skincare as the molecules are too large to reach the dermis, the deep layer of the skin. Better to use a retinol, vitamin C, or to drink a collagen supplement. \n\n_Face serum:_\n* *^Skin Nutrition Botanicals Niacinamide 5% + Squalane Serum** - Truly excellent value! 5% niacinamide is quickly becoming the new industry standard for niacinamide as consumers learn that more does not equal better with this ingredient. 5% is the maximum recommended by dermatologists and cosmetic chemists these days, and even The Ordinary has followed suit. Niacinamide at this strength can help minimize large pores, strengthen skin barrier and help with hyperpigmentation as a supplementary active to a higher strength one and a chemical exfoliant (it takes a shotgun approach to deal with stubborn hyperpigmentation!). Most Skin Nutrition Botanicals serums are similar, but this one stands out because of its slightly cloudy, jelly texture due to the rice ferment filtrate and squalane. Reminds me of Korean skincare. \n* Have tried other Skincare Nutrition Botanicals serums such as the 1% vitamin C (ascorbyl glucoside; vitamin c derivative usually found between 2-5%, and up to 12%) and double retinol. Same gel serum consistency. Nice as serums. Not sure I noticed results. But others who have used them longer (especially the retinol) say they have. \n\n_Lips:_\n* **Vaseline Lip Therapy Rosy Lips** - A made in Korea product, and does have a nicer feel. Thin, jelly texture similar to Nivea lip balm. Supposed to have a tint but is pretty much colorless. Love the scent: like a natural rose, but in a pleasant, non-perfumey way. Not as moisturizing as Aquaphor but not drying either. Also: the large pull off cap is amazing for slippery, just-applied-my-skincare hands. \n* I am interested in the lip spf products. Used to think spf 15 was too low but I heard that you want to apply lip SPF more frequently anyway since it wears off the most (eating, drinking, talking). I’ll check out some more. \n\n##Limited products \n\nI have also tried and liked other Dollar Tree one-off products from better brands clearing out products such as ^^Lumin, Derma Geek, Ouidad Twist** hair conditioner, etc. My favorite is Lumin (face moisturizer in either oily or dry skin variants: citronnel scent similar to Belif moisturizer, and a similar Korean skincare feel like snail mucin infused product, except meadowsweet oil) and Derma Geek (gentle cleanser, night moisturizer with niacinamide).",

        "body": "Have repurchased:\n\n* The cold and flu capsules \n* Colgate sensitive toothpaste \n* Skin Nutrition Botanicals 5% niacinamide + squalane.\n* Global Beauty Care collagen eye cream/skin cream. \n\nWould repurchase: \n\n* Pretty much all, except I’m always trying new products so I’m usually moving on to the next thing. \n* I’d get the deodorant since it’s travel size, but a different scent. \n\nWould not repurchase:\n\n* B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream - I just don’t like the scent. Also the product was too fluid for the jar and leaked a bit when on its side. But, I think it does work as a cold cream cleaning balm in a pinch. \n* Pro Silk shampoo - maybe I’d get it again because of the value size. But it’s just not my favorite texture (runny). \n* Xtracare revitalizing body balm - didn’t really have a need for it. Thought I could use it for thigh chafing but I think it’s probably too stiff in texture to glide well. Didn’t try. \n* On this note I did try a gel stick again anyway, which I reviewed this week: [LA Splash Soothing and Cooling Stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/dollartreebeauty/s/yAX1l7nNnv). Yes it glides better but still drags compared to skipping on a regular serum. Works better with a toner for extra skip. I still feel like I don’t really need this product. And the fragrance makes it less versatile too.",

    "body": "**20s Male, acne-prone, combination skin**\n\nI have been dabbling a lot into skincare this past year to the point where I could say I have a collection of elite products spanning Korean, Indian and Japanese bestsellers and top recommendations. I plan to cycle through and drop reviews whenever I feel like I can.\n\n## Section 1: Moisturizers\n1. ***Cosrx snail mucin 92 all in one cream:***\nSticky, gooey, instant glow, instant hydration, some soothing, not long lasting, no moisturization, didnt help with tret drying on my face, had to buy extra moisturizers. No long term benefits noted.\n*Verdict: 7/10, WNRP*\n2. ***Minimalist ceramides 0.3 with Madeccoside:***\nCeramide moisturizer for acne prone skin, gel consistency, very lightweight(almost as much as acmist or acnemoist), very nourishing, oat extract, fatty acids, cholestrol, golden ratio of ceramides. Used it as night moisturizer, Loved it. A bit overpriced for a 50g moisturizer. Will try bioderma atoderm baume instead. \n*Verdict: 8.5/10, WNRP*\n3. ***Brinton Acmist:*** \nGel cream consistency as per the brand, I'd say it's a quite fluid lightweight cream. A bit of fragrance. Soooooo hydrating. And moisturizes so well too. The perfect balance imo for acne prone skin which leans oily but also gets dry due to tret. Can be used throughout the year but very oily skin people can't use in summers. Bought it twice. Might try other options before repurchasing again.\n*Verdict: 9.5/10, WRP*\n\n---\n\n## Section 2: Sunscreens\n1. ***Minimalist Light Fluid 50***:\nYo this shit is slick, like it floooooows. So thin and so fluid. Very light on the skin, no white cast after blending. Takes more time to blend than conscious chemist sun drink and isnt moisturizing but feels like a better sun protectant to me. No issues using this, whatsoever. A little bit of a shiny finish, not too much tho. Price point is good too considering how expensive good sunscreens generally are, specially of this quality.\n*Verdict: 9.5/10, WRP*\n2. ***Skin aqua super moisture uv gel:***\nAdd the moisturization effects of sun drink and the fluid texture and protection of light fluid and you get this one. I think I like this the most among all the ones I've tried yet, the price point is great, the protection is good, the consistency and feel is nice and i like using it. A bit shiny again. But I dont mind. \n*Verdict: 9.9/10, WRP\n\n---\n\n## Section 3: Toners\n1. ***Klairs unscented supple prep toner:***\nTo say that i was disappointed would be an understatement. This was just overpriced hydration water without any other effects on my skin. Plain rose water works better for me than this.\n*Verdict: 1/10(for hydration), W NEVER RP*\n2. ***isntree green tea fresh toner:***\nPerfectly astringent, hydrating and soaking in like magic. Made my skin feel so rejuvenated and fresh. The slight scent of tea was beautiful too. Helped with soothing too a lil bit. I enjoyed this one. Altho I think its a bit overpriced \n*Verdict: 7/10, WNRP*\n3. ***Plum green tea toner:***\nYo this smells funky but why does it work well?! I mean I didn't feel like it was too much of a downgrade from the isntree one and so inexpensive. The isntree one is superior in terms of tea extract quality and quantity and soothing, but in terms of hydration they are both so similar. I had no issues with this and if I have to get a green tea toner I'd go for this one. \n*Verdict: 8/10, MRP*\n\n---\n\n## Section 4: Milky toners\n1. ***Laneige cream skin:***\nSo damn moisturizing and so rich yet lightweight. Instant glow with much more intensity than mucin. Lovely. \n*Verdict: 8/10, WNRP*\n2. ***Tirtir Milk skin toner light:***\nGlamorised white water. Didnt do anything in front of what laneige did. And so fucking overpriced.\n*Verdict: 1/10*\n3. ***Celimax dual barrier creamy toner:***\nThis is the most nourishing skincare product I have ever used. The hydration, moisturization and barrier support are KRAZY. Love it for battling tret dryness and doing crazy experiments with actives lmao. Makes my barrier feel invincible.\n*Verdict: 9.5/10, MRP*\n4. ***Conscious chemist 7 ceramide milky toner:***\nWanted to try a cheapie milky toner. Ordered this. The bottle is cheap not gonna lie. The atomiser is uneven. Those are my biggest complaints. As for the product its a decent one for this price. Great for added moisture. Consider it a downgraded laneige cream skin. No glow, no hydration, Its just lightweight moisture for your skin. Nothing special. Considering the fact that I get milky toners for barrier support and some extra benefits than just moisturization, this one isnt for me. But someone who wants to try a cheapie, for them its probably a safe bet.\n*Verdict: 6/10, WNRP*\n\n--- \n\n## Section 5: Actives \n1. ***Cosrx bha liquid:***\nI think my threshold for calling something HG is pretty high. But this one deserves it. Niacinamide, salicylic acid, betaine. Perfectly formulated for acne prone skin. Gives flow, unifrom texture, removes blackheads, reduces pore size, gets rid of cc. I think this one is just perfect and it lasts forever.\n*Verdict: 10/10, WRP*\n2. ***Bioderma Sebium night peel:***\n15% glycolic acid. Does what it claims like most bioderma products. I dont hate it but its a bit overpriced, can get any acid peel and that would do more and last more. \n*Verdict: 8/10, WNRP*\n3. ***Bioderma Sebium global cream:***\nLots of sugars, salicylic acid, bakuchiol, squalane, lots of antioxidants, zinc. This is a powerhouse but its just too expensive and doesnt make sense to me. And it didnt do any wonders either. I think its maybe trying to do to much. Didnt feel I was missing out after it got finished. In fact I enjoyed the later moisturizers more for just moisturizing and leaving acne care to respective products.\n*Verdict: 4/10, WNRP*\n4. ***Dermatica Azeproactive:***\nGlamorised azelaic acid prescribed by dermatologists. Just get aziderm gel and save your money guys.\n*Verdict: 2/10, WNRP*\n\n---\n\n## Section 6: Face masks\n1. ***Im from Rice:***\nNourishing, moisturizing, lightly exfoliating. I love rice as a skincare ingredient and this mask has very high quality rice. Too bad it doesnt do anything long lasting for the skin or I would've repurchased. Steep price. Nothing groundbreaking imo.\n*Verdict: 7/10, WNRP*\n2. ***Im from Honey:***\nMuch more moisturizing than the rice one, very rich and creamy, smells so damn tasty. Again very high quality ingredients. Soothes the skin really well. If they had one mask with the benefits of both rice and honey one. I wouldve bought it. Nothing groundbreaking again.\n*Verdict: 7/10, WNRP*\n\n---\n\n## Section 7: Face wash\n1. ***Minimalist salicylic acid:***\nYeah this pretty much sucks. Thats all. The positive reviews here made me buy it, Plum green tea face wash is better.\n*Verdict: 2/10, WNRP*",

Whole egg consumption increases plasma choline and betaine without affecting TMAO levels or gut microbiome in overweight postmenopausal women \\[published online ahead of print, 2020 Apr 22\\]. Nutr Res. 2020;78:36‐41. doi:10.1016/j.nutres.2020.04.002\n\n[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2020.04.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2020.04.002)\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs a crucial part of the symbiotic system, the gut microbiome is metabolically connected to many diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Trimethylamine (TMA) is produced by gut bacteria from dietary choline, betaine, or L-carnitine, and is then converted in the liver to Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which in turn affects hepatic and intestinal lipid metabolism. Circulating TMAO is positively associated with CVD risk. Because eggs are rich in choline, it has been speculated that their consumption may increase plasma TMAO. In this study, we hypothesized that 2 eggs per day increases plasma TMAO level by altering gut microbiome composition in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women. In this randomized, cross-over study, 20 overweight, postmenopausal women were given 2 whole eggs and the equivalent amount of yolk-free substitute as breakfast for 4 weeks, in randomized order, with a 4-week washout in between. Fasting blood draws and stool were collected at the beginning and end of each treatment period. Plasma TMAO, choline, betaine and other metabolites were analyzed using LC/MS, while gut microbiome composition was analyzed using 16S amplicon sequencing. Plasma choline and betaine were significantly increased after whole egg but not yolk-free substitute, however TMAO level was not significantly affected by treatments. Gut microbiome composition showed large inter-individual variability at baseline and in response to the treatments. The consumption of 2 eggs per day in overweight, postmenopausal mildly hypercholesterolemic women significantly increased plasma choline and betaine, but did not increase plasma TMAO or alter gut microbiome composition.\n\n [https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0271531720302669](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0271531720302669) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/au80gtjt0p151.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e063c540ad198bad3ff3d8d29f55149a3633e6a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/94ok1qdy0p151.png?width=3323&format=png&auto=webp&s=205312471df2b42581a7aeb84b580e92544a76f0",

After that, Eric discusses his most recent SBS article about Betaine, and addresses some of the feedback that the article has received. This segment opens up into a broader discussion about how to evaluate a new body of research as it’s developing. Topics include conflicts of interest, how much evidence is required to justify experimentation, and when we can confidently conclude that an intervention simply doesn’t work. Some historical examples are discussed along the way, with some background information about how the steroid, creatine, caffeine, and citrulline malate literature developed over time.

Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

Was MRP 490 for 500 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years. I'm on my second tub\n\nConsistency: White cream.\n\nUsage: I take one big spoonful, add it to half a mug of water, swirl it around till it mixes with the water, dip my hair in and leave it. I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "hey guys! so i know we have the \"basic haircare guide\" in the sidebar, but i think it can be a bit wordy/intimidating for beginners, and i feel like for certain topics i'm sharing the same advice/product recommendations in the comments of threads over and over again. so i thought i would try to put together a couple of super basic/ELI5 guides with a bit more detail/explanation on topics that get asked about a lot. this one is about shampooing/cleansing. \n\ni'm also thinking of doing one about styling (heat, products, things to avoid) and one about fallout/shedding/hair loss (since i feel like that gets asked about a lot for some reason). if you have any other things that you want to see a guide on, let me know and if i feel qualified to do so i'll try to write something about it!\n\n____________\n\n**CLEANSING**  \ncleansing is what you do to remove styling products, sweat, dirt, etc. there are a number of products you can use to do this, which i will explain below. there is no right or wrong way to go about this - you can use any combination of products at any frequency you want. you can use a sulfate free shampoo every day, or a cleansing conditioner every 3 days, or shampoo once a week, or only co-wash. just experiment and do whatever makes your hair do the things you want it to do. remember that even if you don't cleanse your hair every day, you can totally still rinse/scrub with water, use leave-in products, style, and dry every day.\n\n**sulfate/\"clarifying\" shampoos**  \nsurfactants are ingredients that make your shampoo lather up and get sudsy. there are loads of different types of surfactants, and not all surfactants are bad. SLS (sodium lauryl or laureth sulfate) is one of the most commonly used surfactants, but it is generally super drying and can strip all the oils and good stuff out of your hair, so you don't want to use anything containing it frequently. basically anything ending in \"sulfate\" is a \"bad\" surfactant, with some exceptions. if you're unsure about a product ending in \"sulfate,\" search for info on it here or on other haircare forums, or try to figure out what type of surfactant it is (anionic, amphoteric, cationic, or nonionic). nonionic surfactants are generally the most gentle, and most \"bad\" surfactants are anionic. [here is a pretty good article with more info on surfactants in haircare that can help you figure out what is \"good\" or \"bad.\"](http://www.youbeauty.com/hair/the-science-behind-curly-hair-products)\n\nfor the purposes of this guide i'm going to refer to these types of shampoos as \"clarifying\" shampoos, since that is how you should use them, even if the product isn't labelled as a clarifying shampoo. sulfates are super effective at removing product buildup, especially from silicone ingredients, from your hair. so if you use styling products that contain silicones or other buildup-causing ingredients, then you are going to need to use a clarifying shampoo every now and then to remove buildup. \n\nyou also usually need to use a clarifying shampoo when you switch to a silicone-free routine, even if you weren't using sulfates before, just to remove any leftover silicone buildup.\n\n* [neutrogena anti-residue shampoo](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/anti-residue+shampoo.do)\n* [garnier fructis shampoo](http://www.drugstore.com/garnier-fructis-haircare-triple-nutrition-fortifying-shampoo-for-dry-damaged-hair/qxp226120)\n* basically any regular shampoo that does not have the words \"sulfate-free\" on it\n\n\n**non-sulfate surfactant (\"sulfate-free\") shampoos**  \nthese use ingredients that are surfactants, but not \"sulfates,\" to get sudsy. anything under the \"surfactant\" sections on [this list](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/celebrities/ingredients-commonly-found-in-hair-care-products) is a surfactant. coco betaine is probably the most common non-sulfate surfactant. \n\nthese shampoos can still be drying but are usually gentler, and are what you should use if you feel that you need to shampoo every day. they can also be somewhat effective at removing product buildup, except that they won't completely remove silicone buildup.\n\n* [l'oreal everpure](http://www.drugstore.com/loreal-everpure-volume-shampoo-rosemary-juniper/qxp213268?catid=183505)

within this category, but this basically refers to cleansers that are sold as a cleanser but don't lather up. this includes \"no-poo\" products, which are non-lathering cleansers that still strip your

hair. this is probably the most gentle option, and is great for people with dry, frizzy/curly, or coarse hair that needs a lot of moisture. you can use any conditioner for this, as long as it doesn't contain any silicone ingredients (see note on silicones at the bottom of this post). \n\n* [tresemme

\nconditioning is what you may or may not need to do after cleansing to add some moisture back into your hair and smooth/\"seal\" the cuticle. you should definitely condition after any lathering (surfactant-containing) cleanser. you only need to condition after using a non-lathering cleanser if you feel like you need to, and you obviously don't need to condition after co-washing.\n\nwhether or not something is labelled as a \"deep\" conditioner or \"hair mask\" is pretty much irrelevant. you can use a \"deep conditioner\" every day if you want. you can \"deep condition\" with your regular daily conditioner by leaving it on for a longer time than usual or putting a shower cap and/or hot towel over it. you can DIY a deep conditioning treatment or hair mask with food in your kitchen. you can do one of these kinds of treatments whenever you want to feel fancy, and they can help keep your hair nice and soft and happy, but always remember that no product or  magical DIY recipe you found on pinterest is going to actually undo damage.\n\n\n\n\n**NB on silicone ingredients**  \nsee the silicone section of [this list](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/celebrities/ingredients-commonly-found-in-hair-care-products). any silicone ingredient listed is \"not soluble in water\" can only effectively be removed buy sulfates and is one you definitely want to avoid. the silicones listed as \"water soluble\" are debatable. because they are water soluble, you don't necessarily need to use sulfates to remove them, so you are less likely to get buildup. it's not as important to avoid water-soluble silicones in conditioners or styling products, but you should be on the lookout for them if you start experiencing buildup.",

I took a break from using tretinoin and I just did my normal skincare routine for a week and added this in my morning and night routine. Even though tretinoin is a prescription strength product, I have never seen results like this in such little time. \n\nIt contains a bunch of ingredients proven to minimize the appearance of dark spots like lactic acid, an AHA, gluconolactone, a PHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and of course tranexamic acid. It also has ingredients for scar healing and calming like allantoin and betaine. \n\nMy skin is very sensitive and reactive and I experienced no burning or irritation, it is fragrance free and does not smell like anything to me. Honestly my only con about this product is the price, which isn’t even that bad given the results and how long this bottle will last me. Plus I got it 25% off for signing up for the sephora credit card. \n\nI have searched high and low and I havnt been able to find any other product that has this stacked of an ingredient list so I can see why it works so well. But I can’t understand why more people aren’t talking about it!!",

    "body": "Hello, I've posted this before but figured I'd post it again for those who haven't seen it.\n\nI have a fine tuned protocol for getting rid of Sinusitis, which worked for me, a friend, and some members of this sub reddit. \n\nHere is what you need:\n\n1. Distilled water or sterile water \n2. Betadine 10%\n3. Pure birch xylitol \n4. Unscented and colour free baby shampoo \n5. SciNase powder (or equivalent) \n6. Neti squeeze bottle or powered nasal irrigator (MUCH preferred to use a powered irrigator. If you have a waterpik like me you can buy nasal adapters. Do not use a Navage or any product that requires you to buy proprietary saline solution) \n\nHere's how it works:\n\nYou use distilled or sterile water because there is a very small but statistically possible risk of using tap water that can cause problems by introducing pathogens into your nose. \n\nBetadine is a broad spectrum antiseptic and works very well to kill bacteria, it is used to prep skin before surgery and has plenty of strong imperical evidence supporting its germicidal effects and will likely be used by humans until the sun is so close to earth that it burns everything on the planet. \n\nXylitol is antimicrobial. This is also well established imperically. \n\nBaby shampoo has surfactants in it, which can help to emulsify protein biofilms that are protecting a pathogen (mostly non enveloped viruses). \n\nSciNase is a Canadian product for salinating water. It has sodium chloride (salt), Potassium chloride, & sodium bicarbonate. The sodium chloride makes the water isotonic or hypertonic depending on how much salt you use. Potassium chloride reduces inflammation. Sodium bicarbonate adjusts the Ph of the water, for more comfort. \n\nThe squeeze bottle or powered irrigator flushes your nose and removes mucus, I will expand on this shortly. The reason you need one of these & NOT a Neti pot that uses gravity to irrigate is because there needs to be enough force to irrigate, especially if your nose is really congested or swollen. \n\nHere is what you do:\n\n1. Add 250-500 ML of water to your bottle or irrigator, use as much water as you can. \n2. Add 10-30 ML of Betadine 10% (start low and titrate upwards) \n3. Add 25-50 G of 100% birch xylitol. \n4. Add 3 teaspoons of unscented & non coloured baby shampoo. \n5. Add SciNase or an equivalent. You want to use a hypertonic solution, meaning 2%-5% saline in the water. Hypertonic solutions are preferred, isotonic solutions are effective but not as effective as hypertonic solutions generally speaking. \n\nUse this protocol aggressively for the first 2 weeks. I reccomend 4 times per day. After it (hopefully) clears your sinuses reduce to 2 times per day, if that's maintaing remission, reduce to 1 time daily to see whether you can stay in remission at that frequency. \n\nHere is some evidence to support this protocol:\n\n1. Studies consistently indicate hypertonic solutions as more beneficial for sinusitis, primarily due to their superior ability to:\n\nDecrease nasal congestion and swelling.\n\nImprove mucociliary clearance rates.\n\nReduce symptoms faster, including congestion, facial pressure, and pain.\n\n\nKey studies:\n\nA Cochrane systematic review (Chong et al., 2016) concluded hypertonic saline irrigation is more effective than isotonic solutions for improving nasal symptoms, though both solutions offer benefit compared to no irrigation.\n\nResearch published in the American Journal of Rhinology & Allergy (Rabago et al., 2015) found that hypertonic saline irrigation significantly reduces nasal congestion and sinus symptoms.\n\n2. Several small-scale clinical trials and observational studies have shown benefits for chronic rhinosinusitis and postoperative care:\n\nA study in the American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019) found dilute povidone-iodine nasal irrigation reduced bacterial colonization and improved symptoms in chronic rhinosinusitis patients.\n\nRecent evidence (2021–2022, COVID-19 pandemic context) indicates povidone-iodine irrigation may reduce viral loads in nasal passages temporarily.\n\nDemonstrated effectiveness against common sinus pathogens including:\n\nStaphylococcus aureus (including MRSA strains)\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\nHaemophilus influenzae\n\nFungal organisms\n\n3. Xylitol can inhibit bacterial adherence to mucosal surfaces, significantly reducing biofilm formation.\n\nIt decreases the adherence of common respiratory pathogens, such as:\n\nStaphylococcus aureus\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\nHaemophilus influenzae\n\nBy reducing biofilm, xylitol enhances the effectiveness of natural nasal defenses and possibly antibiotics.\n\nXylitol stimulates mucosal hydration by osmotically drawing water onto the airway surface, thinning mucus.\n\nXylitol improves mucociliary transport, facilitating removal of mucus and pathogens.\n\nMultiple studies suggest clinical benefits of xylitol nasal irrigation:\n\nA randomized controlled trial (Weissman et al., 2011, in Laryngoscope) indicated that xylitol irrigation significantly improved symptoms in chronic rhinosinusitis compared to saline alone, especially by reducing nasal congestion and inflammation.\n\nAnother clinical trial (Brown et al., 2018, International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology) found xylitol nasal irrigation reduced biofilm and bacterial load, improving nasal symptoms, especially in chronic or recurrent sinusitis.\n\n4. CRS is frequently linked to bacterial biofilms (especially Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which are resistant to conventional antibiotics and saline irrigation alone.\n\nBaby shampoo contains surfactants (primarily PEG-80 sorbitan laurate and cocamidopropyl betaine) that can disrupt biofilms and bacterial cell membranes, facilitating microbial clearance.\n\n\nReduced Surface Tension:\n\nSurfactants in shampoo reduce mucus surface tension, improving mucociliary clearance.\n\nSeveral studies have investigated the effectiveness of diluted baby shampoo irrigation for CRS:\n\nChiu et al. (2008, American Journal of Rhinology) demonstrated in vitro efficacy of baby shampoo in biofilm reduction, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nHarvey et al. (2009, American Journal of Rhinology & Allergy) found that baby shampoo significantly reduced biofilm biomass in vitro, suggesting potential therapeutic application.\n\nAmerican Academy of Otolaryngology (AAO-HNS) guidelines mention baby shampoo irrigation as a potential adjunctive treatment in select patients with biofilm-associated CRS, particularly those resistant to standard therapies (saline, steroids, antibiotics).\n\n5. Solutions containing both sodium and potassium chloride closely mimic body fluid composition, reducing irritation and promoting comfort. Potassium chloride reduces inflammation in the nasal passages and helps regenerate damaged tissue. \n\nBuffered solutions with sodium bicarbonate optimize mucus thinning and ciliary function, facilitating the clearance of mucus, debris, pathogens, and allergens.\n\nSodium bicarbonate buffers the solution to neutral/slightly alkaline pH (7–8), significantly reducing nasal irritation compared to unbuffered saline solutions.\n\nStudies consistently show buffered saline irrigation solutions are highly effective for relieving nasal congestion, inflammation, and sinus pressure, especially in:\n\nAcute sinusitis\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis\n\nAllergic rhinitis\n\nPost-surgical nasal care\n\n\nBuffered saline irrigation (with sodium bicarbonate) significantly improves nasal symptoms and patient comfort compared to non-buffered saline solutions (Rabago et al., 2002, American Family Physician; Harvey et al., 2007, Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery).\n\nStrongly recommended by professional ENT and allergology societies (e.g., American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, American Rhinologic Society) for routine care in chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and post-operative nasal care.\n\nThese buffered solutions are preferred first-line therapy for nasal irrigation due to excellent tolerability, efficacy, and minimal side effects.\n\nBuffered nasal irrigation powder mixes containing sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate represent the gold-standard first-line option for routine nasal irrigation, combining optimal physiological compatibility, safety, and proven symptom relief. Highly recommended for both acute and chronic sinusitis management.\n\n6. Squeeze Bottles:\n\nWidely studied, well-documented benefits for sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and postoperative nasal care.\n\nRecommended by guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and American Rhinologic Society.\n\nEffective mucociliary clearance; simple to use effectively with proper technique.\n\n\nPowered Irrigators:\n\nProvide more consistent, regulated pressure, potentially increasing thoroughness of mucus and biofilm removal.\n\nSome studies suggest improved outcomes in stubborn biofilm-associated chronic rhinosinusitis or post-surgical patients due to increased mechanical disruption of mucus and pathogens.\n\nStudies indicate slightly superior nasal and sinus cavity penetration compared to manual squeeze bottles, potentially increasing clinical effectiveness in challenging or refractory cases.\n\nPowered irrigators highly recommended when:\n\nPatient has difficulty achieving effective irrigation manually.\n\nChronic biofilm-related sinusitis or persistent mucus accumulation is suspected.\n\nPost-surgical nasal care requiring consistent, thorough irrigation.\n\nFor chronic or challenging sinus conditions, biofilm-associated CRS, or post-surgical care, powered nasal irrigators offer potential superior performance through consistent pressure, enhanced biofilm disruption, and thorough cavity irrigation, provided the patient is comfortable with the technology and cost.\n\nSqueeze bottles are effective and cost much less, but do not provide a consistent, high pressure flow that will aggressively and effectivley irrigate your nose. \n\n\nNow let's talk about side effects. \n\nThis mixture / solution is highly effective, but can be irritating and somewhat painful if you are using too much Betadine or baby shampoo. This is why you need to start low and go slow. The more Betadine and shampoo you use the better, but you have to balance with it in order for it to work. \n\nPersonally, I just pushed myself through the irritation, but for some people it is intolerable and they have to stop. If this happens, drop the amount of Betadine and baby shampoo. \n\nYou do get used to it pretty fast. After about day 4-6 it no longer was irritating or painful. \n\nSometimes your sinuses get worse before they get better, but this protocol is so effective its worth it. \n\nIf you are getting inflammation from it in the early days of the protocol, you can buy a large bottle of Otrivin (or any other fast acting decongestant) and pour the entire contents of the bottle into the solution. Yes, this can get expensive if you need to do it for a week or two straight, but you want to get rid of the Sinusitis, right? \n\nI hope this post is helpful, and I encourage you to try it. It arrested my Sinusitis fast and I no longer have it. I do one daily irrigation that's isotonic, and one weekly irrigation of this protocol per week. \n\nYou want to use the aggressive 4x per day irrigations for 14 days in order to destroy the germs and remove mucous. Once things are getting much better, you can reduce the frequency and the amount of ingredients. \n\nHopefully this helps someone. \n\nIf you have any questions, go ahead and ask!\n\nCheers 😊",

I’ve used a similar recipe and it’s really helped knock out my infections, but when I stop the additives it does start to creep back up for me. Great info about the xylitol, it’s good to know it can even thin the mucous some.\n\nFor the baby shampoo, 3 teaspoons seems like A LOT for the recipe though, I accidentally put 1 teaspoon the 1/2 cup solution when I first started and not only did it burn like a MF 😂 but I was blowing all sorts of bubbles out of my nose. \n\nTwo random recipes online suggest 1/2 teaspoon per 8 oz / 250 ml. \n\nEven that can be strong when you first started, so great advice to go slowly on these additives and build up over time to avoid excessive irritation. Same for the iodine, I’ve seen similar recipes that suggest to add just a few drops. Most saline rinses suggest to avoid iodized salt as it can be irritating to the sinuses.\n\nhttps://mysinusdoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ENTA-Baby-Shampoo-Irrigation-Instructions.pdf",

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too many acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out Asian Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/fz2kw4/list_of_panthenol_products_asian_beauty_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ - Very affordable (\\~$1-12)\n\n$$ - Affordable-ish (\\~$13-24)\n\n$$$ - Mid-range (\\~$25-55)\n\n$$$$ - High-end (\\~$56-100)\n\n$$$$$ - Luxury/Medical Grade (\\~$100+)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Disclosed Panthenol %\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [The Ordinary Amino Acids + B5](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-amino-acids-b5-30ml?redir=1) (5% panthenol, 17% amino acids)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Gel B5 Pro-Recovery Skincare 40ml](https://www.escentual.com/la-roche-posay/larocheposay072/) ($$) - 5% panthenol, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, copper gluconate, vitamin e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 ($$) - 5% panthenol, shea butter, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, copper gluconate ( [https://www.escentual.com/lrpcicaplastbaume001/](https://www.escentual.com/lrpcicaplastbaume001/) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Medisei Panthenol Extra](https://www.ebay.com/itm/PANTHENOL-EXTRA-CREAM-FOR-IRRITATED-SENSITIVE-SKIN-WITH-PANTHENOL-UREA-100ML/263780836273?epid=2260763521&hash=item3d6a9023b1:g:4v0AAOSwZrdbMl27) ($) - 5% panthenol, 5% urea *(Comes in a 100ml tube, very light-weight.

        "body": "The \"Bio-Protein Care and infused with Glutamic Amino Serum\" is not doing anything in the formula except giving their marketing people something to talk about.\n\nThe shampoo is also not having much effect on frizz as the only ingredients that might last through rinse-off include the Guar (cationic polymer) and maybe the dimethiconol (silicone).  Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

Last time I used it, I applied way more than I needed on my hair, and that’s the only thing that got me to see a difference from the last few times I used it. My hair definitely felt smooth and conditioned(a bit on the heavier side), but it was no better than the results I’ve gotten with my loreal dream lengths conditioner. This is just an interesting anecdote, but the people that I HAVE seen rave about this intensive repair conditioner are usually people with chemical damage from bleaching. I have never bleached my hair in my life. I would say my biggest concern is maybe mechanical and heat damage on virgin hair. That’s pretty much it. You’re likely seeing good results with it because it has good conditioning ingredients and the formula that your hair likes.",

    "body": "I've learned so much from this community, so I thought it would be important to give back in the form of reviews. This is every single step in my current routine. I've used all these products for the past six months at least, or intermittently over the past two years. Mistakes and missteps are identified, but aside from those, everything has worked really well. \n\nMy skin is/was somewhat oily yet dehydrated. My skin used to be perfect, basically (yes, I know...pls ABCJ me!), but about six years ago possibly hormone-related changes resulted in prominent CCs that I didn't know how to handle. I also had a lot of sun damage from believing that tans were good, and not using sunscreen. I turned to harsh BP (and stained a bunch of towels), but after a while even that stopped working. \n\nCue /r/skincareaddiction and then /r/AsianBeauty (and the lovely swappers on ABE). After having some semblance of a consistent routine for the last year and a half, modifying and tweaking and researching (and spending a shit ton of money on some mistakes), my skin is bouncy, lighter and brighter than ever, and dewy in a good way. I have only occasional CC's and as far as I can tell it's because sometimes I'm lazy and will skip my routine/touch my face.\n\nMy routine has A LOT of products, but I am not a fan of AIOs and find that having many different essences and serums helps me target all the individual problems with my skin. It also helps hydrate at every step. **Eta: I  know not all of these are Asian/Korean. I don't think everything has to be Korean to be an AB routine. Western products that work well for me are included because I think it's important not to fetishize AB, and to get products close to home as that is more sustainable in terms of shipping.**\n\n* **Eye makeup remover: Garnier SkinActives Micellar Cleansing Water (blue cap).** \nDoes what it says on the tin. Doesn't sting. Good stuff. Will repurchase.\n\n* **Oil cleanser: Kose Softymo Deep.**\nAlso does what it says on the tin. Have purchased backups. I replaced TFS Rice Water Bright with this because the TFS stung my eyes.\n\n* **Second cleanser: CeraVe Foaming Cleanser.**\nGood low-pH cleanser. I used this as a body wash too. Will repurchase.\n\n* **Vitamin C serum (daytime only, alternate with BHA): NuFountain C20+ Ferulic.**\nGreat results, brightening, doesn't break me out. Short shipping times because it's from the US, so I don't worry about oxidation from long shipping from Korea. Will repurchase.\n\n* **Retinol (nighttime only, alternate with AHA): Garden of Wisdom 0.5% Vita ReSurface all-trans retinol serum.**\nI replaced **Missha Borabit/Longer Name Ampoule** because it had the tiniest retinol concentration (I didn't know that when I bought it). I've used this before and it's great, but my usage was too spotty to see results. This time I'll be more disciplined. If I like this I'll bump up to 1%. \n\n* **pH prep toner: CosRx AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner.**\nI'm not certain I need this, but I use it before my CosRx BHA because the BHA is so weak. Will repurchase.\n\n* **AHA (nighttime only, alternate with retinol): CosRx Whitehead Power Liquid.**\nGreat stuff, but will probably replace with **Biologique Recherche P50** when it's done (I've used P50 before).\n\n* **BHA (daytime only, alternate with Vitamin C): CosRx Blackhead Power Liquid.**\nGood but probably not strong enough for me. I recently purchased **Garden of Wisdom's Exfo Tonic** which is a 2% salicylic acid solution, rather than the betaine salicylate in the CosRx, but it was unexpectedly high in alcohol—like super high, and alcohol in small amounts doesn't bother my skin—which caused a CC. Back it goes! CosRx for now.\n\n* **Spot treatment (I actually do this before my routine if necessary: CosRx Returning A-Sol/CosRx Acne Master Patch hydrocolloids.**\nGood. No complaints here. I don't go through it fast enough to consider a repurchase for now.\n\n* **Ferment/First Essence: Nature Republic The First Essence (green cap).**\nThis stuff is AMAZING, it's made my skin lighter and brighter. It has 90% Saccharomyces and licorice extract and it smells great, very clean and fresh. This replaced the **CosRx galactomyces** (racism essence) which did nothing for me. I'm really annoyed that Nature Republic quit making this TFE. WHY?! Why discontinue a product that works?! Have about 30% left, and looking for a replacement. \n\n* **Hydrating Toner: Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion.** \nThe workhorse. Nothing special. I have a decant of the Premium I will be trying, but I might replace this is wth **Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin**, of which I had a decant and loved.\n\n* **Astaxanthin serum: Sidmool Secret of Red Astaxanthin.**\nI ordered this a month ago when I saw that it wasn't popular/couldn't find decants on ABE. Because it only arrived a few weeks ago, it's still too early to judge results, but so far no problems and I like it (I guess?). I use this for its purported antioxidant/anti-aging benefits. Will probably repurchase.\n\n* **Ceramide liquid toner: Skin Watchers Ceramizing Toner.**\nGood, no complaints. Thin and watery with a little bit of substance, as I think it should be. I like the **Dr Jart+ Ceramidin Liquid** but it's way too expensive. I might repurchase this, or I'll get the **Holika Holika Skin and Good Cera Ultra Toner** (which I think is the correct liquid-toner product from that line).\n\n* **Snail ampoule: Mizon Multi-Function Formula Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule.**\nLove Mizon snail products. Moisturizes, soothes, heals. Slippery but not too thick. I use it on my hives too and it seems to help. Will repurchase.\n\n* **Ginseng: Nature Republic Ginseng Royal Silk Emulsion.**\nNeed me some ginseng to prevent more wrinkles. Thick texture, like a light moisturizing cream. Odd scent that I hate, not at all like the First Essence. Kinda reminds me of fast-food restaurant soap, which is a scent I LOATHE. This product doesn't seem to do much, though. I will replace with **It's Skin Prestige Escargot Ginseng Serum**, as Fiddy favorably reviewed that, or **Donginbi red ginseng daily prep essence**. \n\n* **Facial oils: Argan oil during the day (unless I'll be putting on makeup right away), Rosehip Seed oil at night, Neem Seed for zits.**\nAll my oils come from Garden of Wisdom. I love argan oil. I'm trying the Rosehip seed oil to see if that tiny percentage of naturally-occuring tretinoin actually does anything. I also have samples of **olive-derived squalane oil** and **marula oil** to compare against the argan that I'll be adding into the routine soon.\n\n* **Moisturizer: Dear by Enprani Bounce Cheese cream/Skin Watchers Ceramizing cream.**\nThe bounce cheese is really thick but it sinks in right away. Oops, I probably still have dehydrated skin if that's the case! Oh well. I really like it. I am phasing out the Skin Watchers, not because it's useless but because I like the Bounce Cheese more. I'll probably just use the Skin Watchers on my hands.\n\nWhen the Bounce Cheese runs out, or if it's too heavy in deep summer, I'll probably get the **Beauty of Joseon cream**, which I also love. I used to use **Mizon Black Snail AIO** as my moisturizer which was also great, but wanted to try new things. Will purchase/repurchase the Bounce/Joseon/Black Snail as necessary or desired.\n\nI have a half-bottle of **Scinic Iceland Water AIO** that I bought several months ago from TesterKorea, but I think it gave me CCs or whiteheads—I tried a decant and liked it, but after using it every day once I got the full-size, I wasn't impressed. I'll be using it on my legs, I guess.\n\n* **Daytime occlusive: Mizon Snail Recovery Gel.**\nAlso the workhorse. Will repurchase.\n\n* **Sunscreen: Shiseido SENKA Mineral Water UV Gel or Senka Aging Care (spf50 PA+++).**\nThe gel is more of a liquid and I like it, dries matte. The aging care is more of a cream and more moisturizing.\n\n* **Nighttime occlusive/sleeping pack: CeraVe Healing Ointment.**\nBasically a fancy and too-expensive Aquaphor, but it comes in a tube instead of a tub! I hate dipping my fingers into a tub! Anyways, I love it. Excellent sleeping pack.\n\n* **Lip Care: DHC Lip Cream in the pink tube.**\nMy lips are scaly. I've tried the things like scrubbing them with toothbrush, using a grainy exfoliant on them, whatever. I think it might be due to the SLS in my toothpaste. I have a really expensive SLS- and cocamidopropyl betaine-free (gives me mouth ulcers) toothpaste that I'll be trying when my current toothpaste is used up. \n\nANYWAYS, my magic bullet is the DHC. Has lanolin etc, but I didn't want to put Lanisoh (or vaseline) on my lips because I don't like gloopy things on my lips. This stuff has been a godsend. Too bad it's friggin expensive**. For daytime SPF,** I use the **Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer Sunscreen.**\n\n* **Sheet masks.**\nMy favorites are (so far) MBD Damask Rose/Lipsome HA/Squalene, My Scheming Goat Milk, Evercos Ginseng, Lovemore Rose. There are a lot of other masks I like, and a shitton in my stash that I haven't tried yet, but by a hair or several, these are my favorites.\n\n* **What I'm thinking of trying next/Wish List:**\nBecause one's work is never done with AB! I really want to try **Stratia Liquid Gold**, **Innisfree jeju lava seawater essence** if it's really as good as everyone says it is, and most importantly, find some kind of a **first essence that has licorice** in it.",

    "body": "**TLDR**: Here is everything I've tried for suspected hydrogen/methane SIBO. This is not medical advice intended to treat or diagnose anyone, just my own case study.\n\nI didn't take all of these at once, I usually took no more than 2-4 herbs at a time. For extra liver safety when taking multiple herbs at once, look up CYP interactions between the herbs and any existing medications you take and avoid taking combinations that might interact (or consult with your doctor). Most of the supplements I used are from Thorne Research, Pure Encapsulations, Metagenics, Organic India, Life Extensions, and Designs for Health. Research your brands carefully; the supplement industry is largely unregulated.\n\n# Helpful\n\n**Bolded** are the most helpful; interventions in which I noticed a difference almost immediately.\n\nHerbals:\n\n* **Berberine** (works best on empty stomach)\n* **Allicin** (works best on empty stomach for me, but causes reflux and gastritis after awhile so I can only take it for a couple of weeks at a time)\n* **Neem** (1000mg, with meal)\n* Oil of Oregano (Very strong...I caution against jumping to this one immediately. I always took with meals since I couldn't tolerate this on an empty stomach.)\n* Olive leaf extract (empty stomach)\n* Grape seed extract (empty stomach)\n* Nigella sativa extract (empty stomach)\n* Milk thistle (silymarin)\n\nMotility agents:\n\n* **Ginger** (specifically MotilPro, but it eventually caused heartburn and LPR for me so I had to stop)\n* **Triphala** (empty stomach)\n* **Magnesium citrate** (up to 400mg per day, although I usually take 100-200mg, or 300mg at most)\n* **Artichoke extract** (empty stomach)\n* MCT oil (i'd take a teaspoonful whenever i was feeling particularly backed up, as an emergency treatment)\n* spoonful of olive oil on empty stomach in the morning\n* dark chocolate (Double edged sword as this also increased histamine reactions for me. Also need to be careful what dark chocolate you buy because many sources of chocolate have high levels of heavy metals in them.)\n\nFiber supplements:\n\n* **Bimuno**\n* Sunfiber\n\nDigestive aids:\n\n* **Betaine HCl with pepsin** (I was taking up to 6 500mg pills per meal at one point, and tapered slowly off of that as I started producing more stomach acid. Stress also lowers the amount of stomach acid you produce. The die-off from taking 1 pill of this for the first time frightened me and I almost didn't try it again, I got very dizzy and almost felt like I was going to faint. I'm very glad I tried again.)\n\nLifestyle changes:\n\n* **EMDR** or IBS focused meditation\n* Walking, running, or other forms of low/medium impact cardio exercise\n* Squats/deadlifts (can trigger bowel movements)\n* **Sleeping before 1am**\n* **Sleeping > 6 hours a night**\n* Not eating 3-4 hours before bed\n* **No snacks between meals** (good for motility)\n* Whatever activities or changes you can do in your life to reduce stress\n* Singing or karaoke (stimulates vagus nerve, self-soothing)\n\nDietary changes:\n\n* Avoiding dairy ([How do you think methanogens got into your gut?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5344914/))\n* Increase variety of plant foods - eat the rainbow, and eat organic if possible, or at least avoid the [Dirty Dozen](https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php)\n* Specific foods that encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria in your gut microbiome: walnuts, kiwi, pomegranate, broccoli sprouts, legumes (lentils and green peas being two of the most easily tolerated ones, especially if you didn't previously eat a lot of legumes), sweet potatoes, spices (black peppercorn). There are many more beneficial whole foods, these are just some of my favorites that I try to eat every couple of days.\n* Eating something like the mediterranean diet (low to medium fat, low to medium protein, medium low-glycemic carb intake, high in fiber, plants, spices, fruits, and polyphenols) turns out to be healthiest for [your gut microbiome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385025/) - everything in moderation, no major restrictions in diet\n\nProbiotics:\n\nI am especially picky with probiotics because I noticed increased histamine/MCAS-like reactions to some probiotics that I've taken in the past. I try not to take any probiotics these days that aren't single-strain. The strands below should all be non-histamine producing or releasing strains.\n\n* **B. longum bb563**\n* **B. coagulans MTCC 5856 (Lactospore)**\n* B. infantis\n* S. Boulardii CNCM I-745 (Florastor)\n\nBiofilm buster:\n\n* Nattokinase (be careful taking this if you're on blood thinners)\n\n# Didn't notice a big difference, but potentially helpful\n\n**Bolded** are interventions that I felt were more on the \"potentially helpful\" end of \"no difference\" for digestive issues, or things that I would consider trying again. Some of these I took for their adaptogen or mood-boosting effects, hoping that it would lessen stress and help with stomach pain or reflux, but ultimately I didn't notice a huge change from taking them. I'm no longer taking most of these, and of the ones I've continued taking, I'm taking them for reasons other than digestive health.\n\nHerbals:\n\n* **Atrantil** (2x pills per meal)\n* Andrographis\n* Artemisinin (another one to be careful of taking long-term, i suggest no more than 2 weeks at the most)\n* Fenugreek\n* Asafoetida (mostly used in cooking, great for making legumes easier to tolerate)\n* Cinnamon\n* **Parsley oil**\n* **Quercetin** (helped with increased histamine reactions caused by probiotics but didn't do much for stomach problems)\n* Gymnostemma\n* Pomegranate extract (Some research actually shows that this can decrease acidity in your stomach, so be careful about taking it if you already suspect low acid. I always take this for a couple of days when I notice any gastritis symptoms and it helps a lot with that.)\n* Green tea extract\n* **Sulforaphane** (careful taking this for longer than 2-3 weeks at a time, stop immediately if you start feeling any pain in your liver)\n* Apigenin\n* Tumeric/Curcumin (caused increased reflux for me too)\n* Cranberry extract\n* Ashwagandha\n* Mushrooms (reishi, lion's mane, chaga, turkey tail - some of these actually increased constipation for me)\n* Astaxanthin\n* Bittermelon extract\n* **Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice**\n* **Slippery elm**\n* **Marshmallow extract**\n* Aloe Vera extract\n\nFiber:\n\n* Arabinogalactan\n* Acacia fiber\n* Glucomannan\n* Apple pectin\n* Flax seed fiber\n* Psyllium husk ([Taking too much of this (or any fiber) can actually increase constipation too](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/).)\n* **Beta-glucan**\n* **HMOs**\n* Modified citrus pectin\n\nOther supplements:\n\n* Inositol (Didn't have any particular improvement in digestive issues, but I've continued taking after noticing increased mood and wellbeing)\n* **Colostrum** (empty stomach in the morning)\n* Magnesium L-threonate\n* Magnesium glycinate (hoping it would help with sleep, but didn't really notice much benefit)\n* L-glutamine\n* **Vitamin C** (reducing severity of histamine reactions)\n* Iodine + Selenium\n* Zinc L-Carnitine\n* **Vitamin B12** (I still take about 1000mg once a week, just because I don't eat that much meat)\n* Vitamin D3 + K2 (I still take this because I don't get that much sunlight)\n* Omega 3 Fish Oil\n* Phosphatidylcholine\n* Ubiquinol\n* D-Limonene (tried for acid reflux)\n* Sodium Alginate (tried for acid reflux)\n\nDigestive aids:\n\n* Swedish bitters\n* **Digestive enzymes**\n* Beano\n\nBiofilm busters:\n\n* Serrapeptase\n* Klaire Labs Interfase Plus\n\nProbiotics:\n\n* Biogaia L. reuteri DSM 17938 (I made yogurt with this too and also didn't notice a huge difference...it may have actually increased my gas a little, as many lactobacilli seem to do)\n* Pendulum Akkermansia (there's chicory inulin in this as a prebiotic which might cause some symptoms for people)\n* B. subtilis\n* Other various bifidobacterium strains\n\n# Possibly harmful\n\n* Any [lactic acid bacteria probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6006167/) or fermented foods - kefir, kimchi, yogurt, sauerkraut\n* Processed foods\n* Seed oils\n* Sugar alcohols ([sorbitol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35792179/) found in prunes and apricots are often used to trigger bowel movements, but it doesn't seem to be good for you long term)\n* Artificial sweeteners and even some natural sweeteners ([stevia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9028423/)!)\n* Inulin, FOS (feeds everything, including fermenting bacteria)\n* Long-term FODMAP diet (reduces diversity of your gut microbiome over time)\n* Low salt diet (Sodium chloride is one of your main sources of chloride. Guess what your stomach needs to produce HCl? That's right: chloride!)\n* Melatonin (severely slows down gut motility and causes constipation for me whenever I take it, even at <1mg)\n* THC/CBD (also slows down gut motility)\n* Alcohol (literally poison for your gut microbiome...i indulge rarely, and only socially)\n* Metagenic MegaSporeBiotic (caused me to have histamine reactions that lasted even after I stopped taking them)\n* [Overdosing on laxatives/increasing gut motility to the point of diarrhea](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418305853)\n\n# Didn't try but would consider doing in the future\n\n* TUDCA\n* Xifaxan/Rifaximin (I was never offered this or any other antibiotics by any of my doctors. I could probably have gotten even more second opinions or pushed harder, but I wanted to see if herbals worked first.)\n* Phage-based probiotics\n* Looking into pelvic floor therapy or checking to see if pelvic muscle dysfunction is a possible root cause\n* Lactoferrin\n* Moringa\n* Tulsi\n* More herbals (There are many more herbals out there that I haven't heard of or researched yet.)\n* Prolonged fasting up to 2-3 days (Unsure about this, as research shows that fasting can increase Akkermansia...but interestingly, it also increases methanogen presence in the gut. [The gut bacteria of anorexia patients is enriched in methanogens as well.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7835121/))\n* Elemental diet (I also think of this as a last resort because it'll really kill the diversity in your gut microbiome)\n* FMT (if suitable donor/doctor could be found, but from what I've read so far it can be a mixed bag of unpredictable side effects and therapeutic benefit)\n\n=================\n\nThis is a throwaway account and this post is a thank-you to this community and everyone who has shared their stories and approaches. If you take anything away from this, let it be that there is always hope as long as you're still alive, and \"do your own research\" - by which I mean, try to read actual scientific articles from pubmed or other journals to confirm what you're reading online or consult with medical professionals (google scholar is a great resource!). Above all, rely on your own judgement: don't abdicate your critical thinking to anything you read on the internet, including this post.\n\nHere's my story. I was going through an intensely stressful period of my life 2 years ago, culminating in a junk food binge (I had nothing but ice cream, chips, and other processed foods for a week or two). Naively, I thought having some kimchi (probiotics are good right?) and various probiotics would make up for the recent binge. Soon after that I started having a bunch of symptoms:\n\n* Extreme bloating after meals, sometimes I was so bloated I was nauseated\n* Lots of burping, sometimes it would wake me up at night\n* Very little flatulence, all the gas felt like it was trapped in my stomach or colon\n* Constipation and a dull, nagging pain in lower left abdomen, near sigmoid colon (when constipated)\n* Sleeping on my left side when gassy was uncomfortable and painful, it felt like I was lying on some sort of bubble, gas trapped near my splenic flexure\n* Trouble taking a full breath when sleeping on my back\n* Waking up in the morning with sour/acidic taste in my mouth and pain in the back of my throat from acid reflux due to increased gas\n* Could not eat anything with FODMAPs in it without a lot of pain and suffering\n* Increased allergies and histamine reactions\n* Brain fog, fatigue and dizziness, especially after eating\n\nI went to multiple doctors and gastroenterologists who just diagnosed me with IBS and told me to try the FODMAP diet. They refused to do diagnostic exams (endoscopy and colonoscopy) due to my younger age (mid 20s) and lack of occult blood in stool. I tested negative for H. Pylori, but I never ended up taking any SIBO-specific breath tests and mostly went by symptoms and how I felt. My guess was that I was mostly dealing with hydrogen and methane SIBO, as I never had sulfuric smelling gas or diarrhea (besides when I accidentally overused motility agents at various times).\n\nI started with one of the standard herbal treatments recommended in this subreddit:\n\n* Candibactin BR, 2x in the morning, 2x at night\n* Candibactin AR, 1x with every meal\n\nI did this for about 2-3 weeks and felt an almost immediate relief after the first week and a half, although the first couple of days were unbearable with increased die-off gas. In hindsight I'm not sure if I did the right thing going with oregano oil right off the bat. It's very strong and I think I may have permanently damaged my microbiome in some way, because after around 3 months of remission, I started to notice the constipation and pain in my sigmoid colon. What followed that was multiple rounds of different types of herbals as I reached a slightly more \"stable\" place and then relapsed repeatedly. I've listed all the things that I tried above. Most of my rounds were 4-6 weeks long, and then I'd take a break. Taking 2-4 herbs at a time seemed to be mostly safe as I had blood tests during my yearly physicals that showed no abnormalities and good liver numbers.\n\nWhat were my root causes? I suspect high stress (slows gut motility, reduces production of stomach acid), improper use of lactic acid bacteria probiotics and fermented food (fermented food might be fine for people who don't have compromised gut motility, but the food just ended up sitting in my stomach and fermenting even more), and binging on dairy (big source of methanogens in the gut). All of my relapses can be traced back to attempts to fix things with lactic acid bacteria probiotics, fermented food, slipping and having dairy (one of my relapses was caused by a cheese binge!), or having another stressful period in my life where I'd start eating poorly, sleeping poorly, skipping meals, and not exercising.\n\nAfter the most recent round, which was 5 months ago, I've been eating onions, garlic, and other FODMAPs with no problems. I have no major restrictions in my diet besides dairy: I eat nuts, fruit, meat, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, oatmeal, etc, many of which I used to find difficult to digest. I'm still taking Triphala, 100mg magnesium citrate, B. longum bb563, Bimuno, and Sunfiber supportively, but no antibiotic herbals. I've been tapering off the magnesium citrate (down from 300mg/day) and have started to taper off Triphala as well. Current schedule: fiber supplements + probiotics in the morning, magnesium citrate with my evening meal, Triphala on an empty stomach before bed.\n\nAm I cured? I'm not sure...this might be something that I'll have to deal with again in the future. But I'm definitely feeling more optimistic than I've ever been about it, and each time I finish a round of herbals, I've noticed that I'm getting closer and closer to normal. So maybe one day! Good luck to everyone reading this!",

Also been dealing with D3 and B1 deficiency which apparently can further cause issues.

NAC. If I don’t forget I take 1000 pill a day before. If not - around 1-2 hours before the party. Do NOT take NAC after you started drinking and/or closer than 4 hours after your last drink, it makes damage worse. Better save it to the next morning, it helps a lot next day!\n2. A cup of espresso prior to go out. Coffee lessens the damage to your liver significantly. \n3. I regularly take milk thistle + artichoke supplements as a drinker. It eases the bile flow and helps protecting liver too. 300 mg of silymarin on the party day, and the same - in the morning after. \n4. Vitamin B complex. Any time of the drinking day and in the morning after. \n5. 1200 mg of Betaine HCl with all meals on THE day and the next one. \n6. Drink a cup of water after your every 2 drinks. This is such an underestimated advice! I might say this one alone will make your next morning twice as clearer.",

In particular, the treatment of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with agents that release H2S aids preservation of cognitive function, suppresses brain production of amyloid beta, and decreases tau phosphorylation. The possible physiological relevance of these findings is suggested by the finding that brain and plasma levels of H2S are markedly lower in AD patients than matched controls. Hence, nutraceutical strategies which boost brain synthesis or levels of H2S may have potential for prevention of AD. The chief enzyme which synthesizes H2S in brain parenchyma, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), employs cysteine as its rate-limiting substrate, and is allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Supplemental taurine has been shown to boost expression of this enzyme, as well as that of another H2S source, cystathionine gamma-lyase, in vascular tissue, and to enhance plasma H2S levels; in rats subjected to hemorrhagic stroke, co-administration of taurine has been shown to blunt a marked reduction in brain CBS expression. Brain levels of SAM are about half as high in AD patients as in controls, and this is thought to explain the reduction of brain H2S in these patients. These considerations suggest that supplementation with cysteine, taurine, and agents which promote methyl group availability - such as SAM, folate, vitamin B12, and betaine - may have potential for boosting brain synthesis of H2S and thereby aiding AD prevention. Indeed, most of these agents have already demonstrated utility in mouse AD models - albeit the extent to which increased H2S synthesis contributes to this protection remains unclear. Moreover, prospective epidemiology has associated low dietary or plasma levels of folate, B12, and taurine with increased dementia risk. Rodent studies suggest that effective nutraceutical strategies for boosting brain H2S synthesis may in fact have broad neuroprotective utility, possibly aiding prevention and/or control not only of AD but also Parkinson's disease and glaucoma, while diminishing the neuronal damage associated with brain trauma or stroke.",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "Hello, I got [Corsx ‘s new products : Hyrium ampule,gel cream and Centella cleansing powder](https://imgur.com/a/cNAduGY) with the benefit of free delivery as launching promotion. I used them about three days, and it's too early to write review.  However, I want to share some general feeling for those who are wondering abt it.\n\n**Skin type** dry,complex skin\n\n\n**Price** ampule -24000krw, gel cream-23000krw,centella cleansing powder -14400krw\n\n\n\n**Texture and smell**\n1. centella aqua soothing Ampule: It's literally watery. It doesn't feel sticky at all. Frankly, The scent is not fragrant; it is rather odorless. It is absorbed into the skin lightly and instantly. When I used this, I doubted,”huh, what?? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️Is this ampule? Really?”\n\n2. Hydrium greentea Aqua Gel cream :  I hate oily cream. I always prefer gel-type cream. This gel cream is light as the ampule and is absorbed quickly into the skin. I really love the fresh texture. Though it doesn’t smell bad,nor does it smell as fragrant as flowers. There is little incense.\n\n3. Centella cleansing powder : I ordered it bc it was cheaper(to me, in Korea) than Kanebo’s cleansing powder which I liked. I don't know the difference between the two. The amount of foam from it and the feeling of washing are similar to the original. It also has no special scent. \n\n\n**Strengths and weaknesses**\n1. Ampule : 👍 It has the advantage of rapidly hydrating into skin. There is no long-lasting irritation on the face, which I feel whenever I use too heavy ampule or essence. They also do not have powerful points (like full of vitamin C or propolis blah blah) so it can be used at any time without pressure. \n\n🔺 It is difficult to replace one existing ampule. It is so light that it is more like a good toner than an ampule. I'd better add one to the existing routine. \n\n2. Gel cream : 👍It can also be absorbed quickly if applied to the face no matter how much you put on! Its cooling effect is pretty good so I will love to use in this summer weather. This is much better in soothing than the snail cream I'm using.\nSkin turns soft state right after. \n\n🔺 This is also not enough as a lone moisturizer. It's colorless and odorless, so I don't feel this Hydrium line special or unique. Of course, I think I'm used to fragrances and marketing though..I use this at the final step. It's inappropriate to change the existing cream. Also it runs out very quickly. It seems thar I can use it all within 2weeks.\n\n3. Cleansing powder: 👍It’s not stimulating skin. The foam is soft when washing. It washes away the feeling of slipperyness after makeup cleansing with oil. It is good as a substitute for foam cleansing. \n🔺 It’s dry to me. Of course it is natural to be dry after cleansing. But it is far drier so I had to run toward moisturizer. In addition, it is hard to pull the lid when compared to Kanebo’s.  Kanebo’s lid opens at once, while I had to take it off with the teeth!!😥\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Ingredient**\n1. Ampule : Water, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Octanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol\n\n\n2. Gel cream :\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Octanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol\n\n3.Cleansing powder : Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sodium Lauroyl Aspartate, Maltodextrin, Allantoin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lipase, Protease\n\n\n\n\n\n*My thought* :I don't regret getting the products. It's a perfect ampoule and cream for my taste and I'm satisfied. It was very good choice in this hot weather for my skin. However, I think I won’t and can’t expect any special effects like whitening. And somehow,,, I think it’s a bit pricey.\n\n\n\nP.s : I’m not good at English. So there must be grammatical and fuctional errors. Some of my expressions may not be right.😱Please let me know if anything is wrong.\n\n**edit**\nThe ingredient of centella aqua ampule.",

    "body": "People think that by focusing on a single point in the body and applying treatment for that single point, they can heal. The body doesn't work like that. Every single part of the body is incredibly interconnected. **The body is a whole.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's find out how we can make our microbiome and gut healthy in the most correct way possible:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Basic principle:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n > If we optimize the microenvironment of the gut, the microbes living in the gut will also be optimized.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **The most important things to consider when optimizing the microenvironment are:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 1) Temperature\n\n 2) pH\n\n 3) Inflammation and Permeability\n\n&#x200B;\n\n If these elements are defective, even the widely praised FMT will not be effective enough. Send as many good bacteria as you want. They will not be able to function well in a degraded habitat. This is the law of nature. Living things can only live in a suitable habitat for them. If we provide the optimal pH and temperature for our gut and reduce inflammation, our microbiome will improve. If you are going to apply FMT or use probiotics, antibiotics, you should consider these factors first. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Firstly, we must know what to eat:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Some foods can stimulate our immunity. If our immunity is stimulated, inflammation and permeability will increase in our intestine. I don't think we can have a healthy microbiome in an inflamed and leaky gut. \nThe proteins you cannot digest, the fibers you eat in the presence of SIBO, the histamine that you cannot tolerate, high carbohydrate diets, food chemicals and sweeteners are foods that have a high potential to increase inflammation in the intestine and therefore in your whole body.\nThat's why it's important to follow an elimination diet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe will again consider the adaptation principle when choosing our food. The specie of Homo sapiens consumed certain nutrients for tens of thousands of years, and so our digestive system evolved to optimally digest these foods. 10,000 years ago, with the agricultural revolution, we broke our eating habits and with the industrial revolution, we started to consume foods that we did not even know what was in them. The human body is not super talented. So it wouldn't be surprising that this disrupted diet can lead to illness. We did not consume milk and grains 10,000 years ago. I'm not even talking about fast food and junk food. So please research and follow the paleo diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Especially gluten and dairy products are two very problematic food groups. Increase your healthy fat intake and reduce the calories you get from simple carbohydrates. Consume complex carbohydrates with low glycemic index. (If SIBO is present, it will be useful to remove complex carbohydrates from the diet until they recover.) You can regulate your calorie rate as 50% fat, 30% protein and 20% carbohydrate. Make sure you have a histamine intolerance or not. Restrict histamine foods. Use supplements that will help you with histamine, such as quercetin, vitamin C, B6.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSupplements that calm the immune system such as quercetin, curcumin, omega 3 and vitamin D; Using supplements that reduce intestinal permeability such as glutamine and aloe vera will support us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to eat food?:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have to understand that someone who has problems with their gut already has a problem with their digestive system, and we must support our digestive system. Foods that we cannot digest will not please our immunity and gut.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, you have to learn what the parasympathetic nervous system is.\n\n*The parasympathetic system is responsible for stimulation of \"rest-and-digest\" or \"feed and breed\" activities that occur when the body is at rest, especially after eating, including sexual arousal, salivation, lacrimation, urination, digestion, and defecation. It works in opposition to the sympathetic system, that is, the system that causes the \"fight or flight\" response.  We must remain calm to activate the parasympathetic system.  We must stay away from stress, fear and sadness.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n If you noticed it before you start eating, your mouth starts to secrete more saliva. This means that our body prepares our digestive system before food enters our mouth. Therefore, before you start eating, do a little therapy by focusing on the food for 30 seconds, praying if you are believers, or wishing that this meal will benefit you if you are not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Before you start eating, get rid of stress, anxiety, unhappiness, because these will prevent you from digesting the food you eat well. There is no point in eating food if we cannot digest it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Stop thinking about annoying events in your life while eating. Actions such as watching an action movie and discussing will prevent you from staying in the parasympathetic nervous system.  Eat as calmly as possible. Eating with pleasant music can help you stay calm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very important to chew the foods we eat well. If we chew the foods well, we will both support our enzymes by expanding the surface area and increase the effectiveness of amylase as we keep the food in our mouth longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note:** Exercise at least 2 hours after eating for good digestion. In nature, creatures first hunt and do sports, then eat the food they hunt and rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The journey of the food we eat:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n After swallowing the food, it is time for the stomach. The stomach supports both the mechanical digestion of food and increases the contact of the food with the digestive juices by making shaking and rotating movements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The most important enzyme in the stomach is pepsin responsible for the digestion of proteins. Pepsinogen is secreted first so that the stomach does not digest itself. If the stomach is acidic enough, it turns into pepsinogen pepsin. Optimal gastric pH level is in the range of 1.5-3. The use of PPI and H2 blocker disrupts the absorption of vitamin and minerals such as magnesium, iron, zinc, b12. I want you to know that the symptoms of low stomach acid and high stomach acid are the same. Some people use PPI and H2 blockers, although their stomach acids are already low. So please make sure your stomach acid is really high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The semi-liquid state in which food is transformed after exposure to stomach acid and enzymes is called chyme. The time it takes for what we eat to turn into chyme is between 45 minutes and 4 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Chyme is transferred to the duodenum . If the chyme is acidic enough and rich in enzymes, cholecystokinin and secretin are secreted from the duodenum. These secretions are involved in pancreas and bile stimulation. Optimal pH for duodenum is 3.5-4. If this value is impaired, pancreas and bile stimulation will also be impaired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n This secretions sends a warning to reduce the acid secretion of the stomach. It triggers bicarbonate and water release by stimulating the pancreas. In this way, the pH value in the intestine increases. This is important because the microbiota residing here has adapted to a more alkaline pH value. It is also important for enzymes to work properly. In fact, although many people have enough digestive enzymes, these enzymes do not work well due to the impaired microenvironment of the intestinal environment. DAO enzyme, which breaks down histamine, will not be effective enough in this impaired microenvironment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Cholecystokinin stimulates bile production and release.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Bile fluid supports the maintenance of alkaline pH in the intestine. It is an antimicrobial. It has a great role in maintaining the intestinal microbial balance. If your stools are still light-colored, oily, and sticky after 1-2 weeks fatter diet, high chances are that you have bile deficiency. We need enough phosphatidylcholine for bile fluid to become fluid. The vast majority of methyl groups in the body are spent on phosphatidylcholine production, so a healthy working methylation is essential (the body is a whole) ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/lz7mbu/hit\\_methylation\\_connection/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/lz7mbu/hit_methylation_connection/) ). Before bile fluid is secreted, bile acids are conjugated with taurine and glycine to form bile salts. More than 90% of the bile salts formed must be reabsorbed in the last part of the small intestine (ileum). Bile production is a difficult task, and if this absorption process is impaired, bile insufficiency is inevitable. In patients with SIBO, bacteria can deconjugate bile salts before they can be absorbed and cause large amounts of bile to be excreted in the feces. Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium can deconjugate bile salts, and so although we consider these bacteria beneficial, we do not want them to be excessive in the small intestine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The enzyme called protease secreted from the pancreas is protective against bacteria, fungi and parasites in the intestine. The deteriorating microenvironment will disrupt the functioning of this enzyme and will lose its protective properties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Temperature:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n It is the thyroid that provides the optimum ambient temperature for the intestine. Enzymes work best at optimum ambient temperature. If enzymes work inadequately, the food we eat will not be digested and absorbed, and will be fermented by microbes to produce toxic metabolites, causing problems such as bloating and diarrhea. In addition, indigestible proteins can lead to food intolerance and allergies by causing an immune response in our intestines, which constitutes approximately 70% of immunity. Thyroid hormones make possible the energy required for migrating motor complex and enzymatic secretory reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Iodine, iron, zinc, selenium, magnesium and vitamin D are very important for your thyroid to work properly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n (Optimal ferritin level for iron approx: 50 ng / ml)\n\n (The magnesium level in the blood will not show you your magnesium deficiency because only 0.5% of the magnesium is in the blood. Most of it is in the cell. Measuring the intra-erythrocyte magnesium is correct.)\n\n (Optimal level for vitamin D is about 70ng / ml)\n\n (If magnesium is deficient, vitamin D does not work well.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Basically, we should focus on:\n\n 1) regulating the diet\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 2) Chewing food well, not consuming water and alkaline liquids during meals. I recommend drinking water at least 30 minutes before and at least 1 hour after meals because water is highly alkaline compared to stomach acid and can make things difficult for someone who already has an impaired digestion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 3) Activating the parasympathetic system (psychotherapy, yoga, breath therapy...)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 4) Supplementing stomach acid(betaine hcl, apple cider vinegar), digestive enzymes(pancreatic) and bile(taurine, phosphatidylcholine, ox bile, vitamin C, cholestrole(egg)) with supplements if necessary\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 4) Supplementing the missing vitamins \"according to blood tests\"\n\n (In most laboratory blood tests, the prescribed reference ranges are very insufficient. For example, the optimal value for b12 is 700-800 pg / ml, but the reference range written in the laboratory is an absurd range of 200-1100 pg / ml .)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 5) If necessary, using prokinetic and constipation supplements\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 6) If necessary, using supplements to reduce permeability and inflammation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 7) Eating 1-2 meals a day and avoiding snacks\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 8)and I think the most important thing is to share our love, knowledge and food with our neighbors, friends and animals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that modern medicine lovers cannot understand what I am saying.  All those people know is to give the patient a small capsule or tablet and wait for it to heal. But no. The patient's mental state, vitamin D, methylation, intestines, malnutrition he eats, foods he cannot digest, and the stress he is exposed to from his environment are very important.",

    "body": "Hey guys!! I just wanna start off by saying I usually do reviews for Korean skincare, but as a Vietnamese person feel like I have so much pride in this brand which proudly comes from my country.\n\nYou mostly know that I am a Sulwhasoo and Whoo guy based on the focus of my reviews previously, and I had never told my followers why it is that I love them so much, in essence. In a world where Asian brands had to resort to using French names, chase high-tech ingredients, and employ Caucasian models, yet still losing market share to Western giants, these brands held true to their roots (literally) and celebrated their culture as well as herbalism. And now, they are the major players in the beauty industry, sitting beside the giants that once could've stomped them like a bug. To me, there is no greater inspirational underdog story in beauty than that. \n\nVietnam has never been popular for its cosmetics industry. Everything from bad packaging to greasy, poor-performing, and even occasionally dangerous formulas. The decent Viet brands wanted to distance themselves from that reputation therefore sometimes, they pretend that their product came from a more developed country (Canada, France, Korea...). \n\nCocoon was the first proudly Vietnamese brand of this echelon (they're sold in drugstores and supermarkets nationwide, online, and now in Malaysia, Singapore, and the US!). They're the second revolution in Vietnamese cosmetics history after Co Ba soap (hopefully writing a blog post about that soon). Extremely affordable, chic packaging, great scents, top-notch ingredients that you'd probably have some trouble finding in even higher-end offerings, and incredible results. They have products made from specialty crops grown in specific regions of Vietnam. This was actually an idea for a skincare line I had for such a long time but they really materialized it and brought it to life, which is beautiful for me. So, let's dive into the mega guide!\n\n##Winter Melon (Bí đao): This is their line for acne-prone, oily, congested, and inflamed skin. They use winter melon extract which is anti-inflammatory and hydrating along with other tried-and-true actives such as Niacinamide, Salicylic Acid, and a form of Azelaic Acid called Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate.\n\n\n###-Micellar water: \nSmells like the toner, with impressive cleansing power. You can remove very waterproof makeup with this. Leaves a refreshing feeling.\n\n\n###-Cleansing gel: \nThis was my cleanser for maybe the better half of 2021. I wouldn't say I mega love it but it's definitely a dependable cleanser and smells like a refreshing tea tree. It doesn't lather much and it doesn't leave my skin dry. The pH is 5.5 and I quite like it, but it gets mundane fast.\n\n\n###-Toner: \nA refreshing alcohol-free toner with winter melon extract, tea tree oil, and Niacinamide. It smells so good, It says it doesn't have \"Fragrance\" but it has rosemary and lavender oil which can explain the scent. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. I felt it was meh for my skin though.\n\n\n###-Mask:\nA soft-drying clay mask with tea tree oil and winter melon extract. Definitely not for sensitive skin. It gives your skin an immediate cool zinging effect which feels like menthol on the skin and I feel like people with more sensitive skin wouldn't like it. It dries quite soft and doesn't leave your skin feeling stripped or dry, but still very clean.\n\n###-Serum: \nThis is their most impressive product in this range by far, it's a serum with winter melon extract, 7% Niacinamide, TECA complex (centella asiatica and constituents), Acetyl Glucosamine, Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate, Ferulic Acid, Bisabolol, Salicylic Acid and Zinc PCA. The serum aims to provide global action for acne-prone skin by bringing down inflammation, hydrating, clearing pores, and brightening leftover acne marks. Now this all sounds great in theory however using it long term I've noticed it doesn't do everything claims to do flawlessly but some of it yes. My acne marks were visibly brightened, my skin looked less red and my texture was a lot more even, even though my raging zits didn't benefit from it. You do get a lot (70ml/2.33oz) for a little under 30 USD so that's great. The texture is very liquidy and foams up if you massage it into your skin which I find a bit off-putting. It wasn't enough to make me stop using it until the upgrade was released.\n\n###-N15 Serum: \nThe extra-strength version of the original serum, boasting a superstar lineup of 15% Niacinamide, 4% N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Mandelic Acid, and many more. This formula originally came in a dropper bottle which made it impossible to dispense and generated many complaints, but I'm glad the brand took notes and repackaged it in a pump. Their attention to feedback is something I admire and that you will continue to see demonstrated in some of the products I name below. The formula is a bright orange, siliconey gel that dries a bit powdery, which you will definitely notice when it clumps up into residue around the nozzle. However, this is one of the best anti-acne treatments I've ever encountered. It targeted my acne in its premature, mature, and post-inflammatory stages and it's just one product. My skin looked visibly clearer after a month and I cannot thank this product enough. Holy grail. \n\n###-Acne drops: \nThis is an interesting spot treatment that omits Salicylic Acid, the first option that comes to mind when formulating a spot treatment. Rather than taking the traditional approach of pure decongestion, it employs 20% Azeclair (equivalent to 6% Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate by weight) in the formula to holistically reduce irritation, inflammation and discoloration. It works pretty fast and is exceptional at bringing redness down, whereas inflammation takes a bit more time. I highly recommend it with the N15. \n\n###-Gel cream:\nA gel cream formulated with 5a-avocuta and TECA to reduce inflammation and control oil production. It is surprisingly oily/tacky at first for a cream that claims to control oil but soaks up quite nicely leaving not much of a residue. On my predominantly dry skin it did not make it any drier. In fact my skin felt comfortable, but not for the whole day.\n\n###-Sunscreen: \nAt SPF 50+ and PA++++ with HEV protection, this unscented organic sunscreen marks one of Vietnam's first forays into the sunscreen market. It is surprisingly lightweight, however it does not dry down matte. I felt like I didn't sweat more with it in (which is a common occurence for sunscreen) and it did stay put very well. \n\n###-Body wash: \nThis is a soap-based body wash scented with lemongrass. It's got a golden liquid texture and foams up very well. It's meant for back acne, but I typically reserve it for the unmentionables OOP because it is deep cleaning, smells good, and prevents odors.\n\n###-Body mist: \nFormulated with a combo of AHAs and BHAs as well as winter melon extract, this body mist demonstrated an excellent anti-acne and anti-redness action on my friend's back. Whereas for me I also use it where I use the above-mentioned body wash since it helps to reduce bumps and even out skin tone for a home-wrecking, soul-crushing, undeniable boochie hole. I would note that this is not something you want on your mucus membranes so please cover them up when spraying areas like your groin.\n\n##Hưng Yên Tumeric (Nghệ): \nThis is their brightening line which uses turmeric from Hưng Yên (my grandma's hometown!) and many other proven actives such as Ethylated Vitamin C, Hexylresorcinol, Acetyl Glucosamine, AHAs and Niacinamide. What I like about this line is that it uses many derivatives of turmeric rather than just its extract.\n\n###-Cleanser: \nFor sure smells like turmeric, not in your face but it's definitely there. 4% of Lactic Acid makes the skin feel slightly smoother after cleansing. Reminds me a lot of my once HG Sulwhasoo Snowise cleanser actually.\n\n###-Toner: \nA toner with 5% AHA and Betaine that aims to brighten, hydrate and smooth skin texture. This formula smells amazing, is hydrating enough to be a treatment essence and after 2 weeks of use leaves skin with a soft glow. All round solid toner even though I'd call it a treatment essence. The addition of Allantoin also lends a nice soothing effect.\n\n###-Mask: \nClay mask enriched with turmeric powder and oatmeal which claims to brighten. It smells strongly of turmeric and has granules. It dries harder more like a traditional clay mask like Kiehl's Tumeric and Cranberry mask and less like their own winter melon mask. My skin always feels nicely clean after using it although instant brightness is not observed.\n\n###-Serum: \nAlso another impressive product from them. Contains 10% Ethylated Ascorbic Acid, a water-stable form of Vitamin C highly efficacious for brightening. Along with that, it's paired with 4% Niacinamide, 2% N-Acetyl Glucosamine, and turmeric oil. It's an orangey gel serum that consists of a continuous yellowish phase with orange droplets suspended throughout. The texture absorbs quickly and leaves the skin slightly moisturized. Results are noticeable at 4 weeks, the skin is more glowing and even-toned. Considering the steep price of ethylated Vitamin C, I am surprised to find out the serum is roughly $30 for a 1oz bottle!\n\n###-C22 Serum: \nAn upgraded version of the classic Serum, this serum contains a whopping 22% of 3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid compared to the original serum's 10%. They also included 4% Niacinamide and 2% N-Acetyl Glucosamine like the original. Still, they bolstered the heightened efficacy with 1% Hexylresorcinol for powerful melanin control and 0.5% Ferulic Acid to create an antioxidant synergy with the Ethylated C. Instead of using turmeric oil to mimic the original, they opted for turmeric extract, which made the formula's color a mild yellow. The texture is fresh and fluid as water, only it left a slightly emollient finish like an oil which was interesting to say the least. After 4 weeks, the serum had a noticeable effect on the dark spots on my periorbital area and redness was reduced. Because of the higher C concentration, my skin did tingle at times after applying the product following another product with actives. And for just 35 USD, this product is absolutely a must-try.\n\n###-Gel cream: \nA gel cream enriched with turmeric extract, curcuminoids, and Hexylresorcinol. This is the lightest moisturizer Cocoon has to offer, bursting into water upon application. It only makes me wonder if it works to moisturize at all. That being said, my skin feels well-rested and fresh after using this every night, and less dull by the end of the day when I use it in the morning. That being said, for as long as this will last me, I will use it as a day cream.\n\n###-Mist: \nA mineral-enriched mist containing powerful antioxidants such as turmeric extract, superoxide dismutase salts, and EGCG. The addition of 5 amino acids also helps to increase moisture retention. The mist smells lovely, the grain of the droplets is extremely fine and almost comparable to an aerosol and it is lovely to apply over makeup. It does help the foundation oxidize less, but I have not noticed much long-term skincare benefit.\n\n##Rose: Sourced from the roses on the highlands of Cao Bang, this line is focused on providing hydration and reparative benefits. The rocky terrain and calciferous nature of the soil create a perfect environment for the growth of Damask roses, rich in tannin which is known for its astringent properties.\n\n###-Bi-phase Micellar Water: \nA true warrior for eye makeup, this bi-phase micellar cleanser was the result of repeated complaints about its predecessor's cleansing abilities. Formulated with rose extract, god-tier antioxidant Astaxanthin, and repairing Vitamin B5. This micellar water removes just about anything and is very gentle on the skin. It also feels more moisturizing than the Winter Melon one But I am not a fan of wiping my makeup off anyway so I won't be reaching for this a whole lot.\n\n###-Cleansing Oil: \nA non-emulsifying, yet rinseable cleansing oil that gives a very interesting feeling. On one hand, it feels very much like an oil on the skin and removes makeup effortlessly. On the other, it is not a true oil chemically speaking, so it can not emulsify but rather just rinse clean off the skin. I really love this product and it is by far my favorite cleanser of the brand, but I would describe this as a one-step cleansing serum. My skin was so smooth after and just clear of everything.\n\n###-Cleansing Gel: \nIt is lightly foaming and subtly scented by the rose. Gives a nice clean that is not drying. But not the most interesting cleanser.'\n\n###-Toner:  \nMade with real rose petals and Hyaluronic Acid, this toner is strikingly plain compared to the precedent other Cocoon products I've tried have set, so I've found it to be nice and enjoyable but quite underwhelming.\n\n###-Mask:\nA rinse-off gel mask with rose petals, Pentavitin and Hyaluronic Acid. It became my new favorite hydration mask ever since I discovered that you can just rub it into the skin with little stickiness. I've used it as a sleeping mask since over moisturizer and I've never woken up with dull skin again. Also since it smells so good, I genuinely don't feel like rinsing this mask off does it justice, but YMMV.\n\n###-Serum:\nHands down, the most impressive hydration and repair serum I have ever used. Holy grail status. It is so fresh and light, but it bears so much substance. Packed with 5% Vitamin B5, 5% Betaine, 5% Urea, Ectoin, Hyaluronic Acid, and rose extract, this serum is an antioxidant powerhouse that calms irritation and hydrates profoundly. Its juicy texture goes a long way and I can see a major improvement in my skin's plumpness and tone after one bottle. Makes my foundation go on better, is amazing on lips, all round great hydrating product. Snag yourself a bottle now because this is my favorite product from Cocoon ever,\n\n###-Gel Cream: \nThe richest moisturizer that Cocoon has to offer, but with that being said it's not that rich. I can use it as a night cream when days are a bit hotter, but under my AC, I always pair it with my trusty Whoo Cheongidan oil. It's got Pentavitin, rose water, Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamin B5, which seems in line with everything else in the range. And I could say that it's a solid staple moisturizer most skin types (except very oily) can enjoy. Drier skins might appreciate this more mixed with a facial oil.\n\n##Dak Lak Coffee: An exfoliating and nourishing line for the body. face and lips made from upcycled coffee grounds. The coffee used was grown in Dak Lak, the capital of coffee in Vietnam.\n\n###-Body Scrub: \nThis creamy, deliciously-scented body scrub smooths, polishes and moisturizes. It is not the most groundbreaking product since it's not the first, but Cocoon's creamy formula along with the appropriately sized coffee granules gave my skin a much-needed invigorating scrub that leaves it softer every time. No wonder it's their #1 best seller.\n\n###-Facial Scrub: \nMade with finer coffee grounds than the body scrub, this unscented scrub smells more naturally coffee than the body scrub's delicious milky coffee scent. It goes on the skin smoothly and is a scrub that never fails to bring the skin an instant glow. I use it in the shower all the time and I love it with my chemical exfoliators because it's got just the right density of granules.\n\n###-Lip Scrub: \nA scrub-in-stick featuring Cocoon's finest coffee grounds suspended in a creamy base of macadamia oil and shea butter. This lip scrub effectively removes dead skin flakes, but at the end of the day not much more impressive than your regular lip scrub. But what more can you ask from a product under 3 USD?\n\n###-Body Butter: \nA deeply moisturizing butter with coffee oil, tamanu oil and shea butter. This was very rich which was surprising, since I was under the impression Cocoon tends to shy away from richer textures. Granted, this is their only richly textured product.\n\n##Pomelo: A haircare line that harnesses the Pomelo oil's active molecule Limonene for effective hair fall reduction, as well as Xylishine, Vitamin B5, and amino acids to thicken, condition, and add shine.\n\n###-Shampoo: \nA sulfate-free shampoo aimed towards all types of hair. This is my regular shampoo since it smells so amazingly citrusy, but I will have to say it's not the most conditioning shampoo, as I felt my bleached hair was quite dry and tangled after shampoo and before conditioner. I also noticed it is not the most color-safe shampoo, and I learned that the hard way when I had my hair dyed blue. But now that I only lighten my hair, I consider this a solid shampoo in terms of cleansing efficacy and strengthening effect.\n\n###-Conditioner: \nA conditioner that smells equally amazing and is so wonderfully smooth. It rinses clean and leaves the hair smooth and soft. Shine is dramatically amplified. Although I regret to say the smoothness was short-lived, only lasting half a day after washing, I understand it is more formulated for virgin Asian hair, not needy bleached hair like mine. They changed the packaging from a pump to a tube due to consumer demand.\n\n###-Hair mask: \nMy favorite hair mask of 2023. The texture is kind of marshmallowy, reminiscent of L'Oreal Professionel's Blondifier mask, albeit a little thicker. Smells amazing and I can feel it gives my hair longer-lasting nourishment than the conditioner, which is why I have substituted it for the conditioner entirely. My hair's shine is so unreal and the softness is incredible.\n\n###-Hair tonic: \nA tonic with Baicapil, Bisabolol, Vitamin B5 and Bisabolol. This product is again another improvement from its predecessor, which was greasy and had a jammed spray nozzle. The new oil-in-water formula comes together shaken, and applied through a targeted nozzle. The new formula is much lighter, has a light hold, and works to increase shine and reduce hair fall.\n\n##Mint and Eucalyptus: A refreshing body care line with mint and eucalyptus oils. The scent is deeply reinvigorating and refreshing but leans a bit masculine.\n\n###-Body Wash: \nThis body wash smells woodsy almost, with an unmistakable menthol tingle. It cleans properly, foams well, and does not dry out the skin. A bit steeper priced compared to drugstore body washes but worth the try.\n\n###-Body Lotion: \nSame scent but no tingle. Its a light gel cream formula that gently hydrates and smooths.\n\n###-Hand soap: \nNever used this one but bet it smells the same. And it is bunny shaped :3\n\n###-Hand Sanitizer: \nMy go to tbh. It smells so spa like using it every time, and I've gotten so many compliments from friends and strangers!\n\n##Miscellaneous products: These are products not from any particular range\n\n###-Palmyra Sugar Body Scrub: \nAn oil and sugar scrub that smells fresh and zesty yet warm. It instantly and dramatically refines skin texture and leaves behind a trace of moisture. My personal favorite of the two Cocoon body scrubs.\n\n###-Inca Inchi hair serum: \nA hair oil with Omege 3, 6 and 9, holy basil oil and vitamin E. This is your average silicone based hair oil and not sure if it works better than a cheaper silicone hair serum but my hair likes it.\n\n###-Ben Tre Coconut Lip Balm: \nMy hometown Bến Tre is known for it's coconuts. The oil extracted from coconuts are used to make this lip balm. It goes on clear and matte, and it gives good emollience to the lips. That being said, it is not that different than other coconut lip balms, maybe the fact that it has a matte finish.\n\n#So that's been it for Cocoon and I'll be back to review more if they launch more. I hope you guys give it a try because I certainly love it!",

    "body": "This isn't a new product (to me or the sub) but I rarely see it talked about, so I figured I would give it a review. I've been using this cleansing oil on and off for about 18 months.\n\n**Skin type:** I'm in my 30s, and my skin is generally oily (formerly dehydrated/oily), but has recently become a lot more dry due to the dry winter weather and prescription tretinoin use. My primary skin concerns run a wide gamut - I'm focused on anti-aging because of my age, but I also have acne, clogged pores, PIH, and melasma. My skin is very, very clog prone. Basically, my skin is a \"special snowflake\" that thinks the world should tremble in fear.\n\n**Location/weather:** I live in the Mid-Atlantic area of the US, so the weather is hot and humid in the summer, and cold and dry in the winter.\n\n**Other first cleansers I have tried:**\n\n* Heimish All Clean Balm\n* LJH Dr's Care Cleansing Oil\n* Whamisa Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil\n\nI have also, in the past, tried traditional OCM with mineral oil. It did not go well (lots of clogs), and in general, I now try to avoid cleansing oils with mineral oil in them, hence why I haven't tried some of the more popular cleansing oils on this sub. The LJH Dr's Care also contains mineral oil, and also didn't go over well with my skin.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review.\n\n**Ingredients (copied from Ulta.com):** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Water, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Black Sugar Extract, Sodium Pca, Betaine, Threonine, Sorbitol, Proline, Lysine, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Alanine, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Serine, Glycine, Alcohol Denat., Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceramide Np, Sarcodon Aspratus Extract, Sucrose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta.\n\n**Price:** This oil cleanser is easily found on tons of websites. I most often buy from Amazon, and pay about $14-15 USD for a 200mL bottle.\n\n**Smell:** This oil smells *strongly* of lemon, with the faint hint of sugar. The smell is very noticeable on application, but once the cleanser is rinsed off, it dissipates completely. I happen to like the smell, but others may find it a little too reminiscent of Lemon Pledge.\n\n**Texture:** This cleansing oil seems rather thin - it seems to be slightly thinner and less viscous than vegetable oil. Sometimes this is annoying, as I have to use a little more oil than I'd like to really massage my face well without pulling my skin (3 pumps or so).\n\n**Cleansing Power:** In my opinion, this oil cleanser does a fantastic job with face makeup and sunscreen. It does not excel with waterproof eyeliner and mascara - it will remove some but not all waterproof eye makeup. I, however, do not like to use this on my eyes. I wear contact lenses and it always causes them to get milky, making it difficult to see. The cloudy residue lasts several hours. I do not know if this would impact someone who doesn't wear contacts. However, with face makeup and sunscreen, as well as with some superficial clogs, this oil cleanser does a great job. I sometimes, but not routinely, feel grits coming out of my skin. It does not help break up deeper clogs or closed-head blemishes.\n\n**Emulsification:** This stuff turns pretty darned white when mixed with water. I make sure to rinse all traces of it off my face so I don't see any of the cleanser, especially near my hairline. It emulsifies and rinses off easily, and doesn't leave any feeling of residue on my face. I always follow with a second cleanser, but I do not feel a film or greasiness with this cleanser. It also doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry - just clean.\n\n**Overall:** I really like this cleanser and have repurchased it many times. At the price point, it does what I need it to do. It breaks down the face makeup (Mac Studio Fix Fluid or Estee Lauder Double wear, topped with Innisfree powder) and my sunscreen (La Roche Posay Ultra Fluid). It rinses cleanly, and it is inexpensive and easy to find. I don't expect **any** cleanser to address aging concerns, or to meaningfully use acids. Any claims of brightening from a cleanser are probably worthless, since the product isn't on your face long enough to do any meaningful chemical exfoliation. This cleanser is best at what it does not do: it doesn't create new acne for me and it doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nIt is probably not my favorite of all oil cleansers. Right now that would be Whamisa, which is great, but expensive, and which also doesn't seem to penetrate pores as deeply as the Skinfood cleanser. Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil is a great choice that I will probably continue to buy it, especially since it's easy to get in the United States. I think it's an excellent pick for a first cleanser that isn't based on mineral oil, but only if you are not sensitive to fragrances.",

Most of them come in paste form in a tube and by soap I mean a type of surfactant that is saponified oil (fatty acid with alkaline) not bar soap.\n\nMany of J & K-beauty cleansers have Myristic acid, Palmitic acid and Lauric acid as one of their first ingredients, which are fatty acid used to form soap. \n\nMeanwhile Western ones have other forms of surfactants such as SLS, Lauryl glucoside and \nCocamidopropyl betaine.\n\nSome “clean” J & K-beauty brands say it’s “SLS-free” though no face cleansing products there even formulated them with SLS to begin with. While Western one didn’t really use soap (most aren’t paste but more gel or liquid) so the decision was in between SLS or other milder surfactants like ~~glucoside or ~~ betaine.\n\nWhy do I not see soap-free trend there?

    "body": "To date, I've tried seven different cleansers! I guess you can call me a cleanser guinea pig LOL.\n\nFor background purposes, I live in Canada, and have normal to dry skin.\n\nCleansers: \n\n1. Muji Face Soap Scrub\n2. Cosrx Good Morning Gel Cleanser\n3. Heimish All Clean Green Foam\n4. Derma E Hydrating Cleanser\n5. Etude House Soonjung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser\n6. Hada Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam\n7. Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing 5.5 Cleanser\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to be **evaluating** each cleanser on the following **criteria**:\n\n* Is it pH balanced? (slightly acidic, range from 5 to 7?)\n* Is it non-drying? (Avec the non-scientific method of not moisturizing afterwards and seeing if my skin is crying)\n* Is it affordable, and easy to find?\n* Is it made of safe ingredients? (Avec EWG ratings)\n* Is it satisfying to use?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start with the first cleanser I ever purchased, the **Muji Face Soap Scrub**. I found this for around $6 CAD at Muji. Being a total AB newbie, I picked it up not thinking much about the [ingredients](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8ef424943.html). It has peach pit particles which are supposed to exfoliate your skin. This sounds a bit like the infamous St. Ives apricot scrub LOL.\n\nUnfortunately this cleanser has a pH of 7.5. Although it worked well to clean my face, and didn't break me out, once I found out about the importance of using a low pH cleanser, I began my hunt for one. And thus begins the saga of me purchasing too many cleansers.\n\n>pH balanced? No. Although at a 7.5 it isn't as horrendous as I had estimated before I tested it, it should not be basic. Thank you, next!  \n>  \n>non-drying? Yes.  \n>  \n>affordability and convenience? Yes, if you live in a place where Muji has physical stores.  \n>  \n>safe ingredients? This product has many acne triggers on Cosdna.  \n>  \n>satisfying? heck yes i'm ashamed. Unscented aka slight chemical scent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, I purchased the **Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**. It seems to be very popular. I bought it for $22 on Amazon Canada. Unfortunately, the first time I tried it, it broke me out on my forehead. This was around September. I persisted with it for around two weeks before admitting that it was breaking me out. To this day I still don't know exactly what it was. I've heard Coco-Betaine was an irritant, or it could be the tea tree oil, but I've used other products with these ingredients and my skin was fine with those.\n\n>pH balanced? Yes.  \n>  \n>non-drying? Not really. While it wasn't the most drying cleanser I used, my skin felt slightly irritated and dry.  \n>  \n>affordability and convenience? Meh. It's available everywhere but isn't very cheap.  \n>  \n>safe ingredients? [Another meh](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_4c1a258011.html).  \n>  \n>satisfying? Not at all, this one didn't foam very much. :( Smells like pine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter the disaster that was Cosrx, I went for the **Heimish All Clean Green Foam**. It has a pH of 5.5 and comes in gel format. All I can say was, thank GOODNESS I went for the travel size!! This cleanser did not break me out, but it DRIED THE BEJEEZUS out of my skin. Seriously, ten seconds after cleansing, my forehead looked like roof shingles. Even after three layers of moisturizer my skin was still flaking. Good riddance.\n\n>pH balanced? Yes.  \n>  \n>non-drying? hah. hahahah. hhhhhhh. hahaha.  \n>  \n>affordability and convenience? Decent, a little more expensive than Cosrx.  \n>  \n>safe ingredients? [Yes](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d8f5360830.html). This one has all green from Cosdna which just shows that product safety ratings don't mean your skin will like the product.  \n>  \n>satisfying? More than the Cosrx, but still not very foamy. :( Smells like grass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter my skin got dried out by the Heimish, I tried **Derma E's Hydrating Cleanser**. It has a reported pH of 5.5 on their website. I did not find this hydrating at all. My skin would start to flake quickly if I didn't moisturize right after cleansing. Overall, I think this cleanser is overpriced ($20 CAD for 175 mL) and doesn't live up to it's name!\n\n>pH balanced? Yes.  \n>  \n>non-drying? not really.  \n>  \n>affordability and convenience? Can be found on iherb, or in your local grocery store.  \n>  \n>safe ingredients? [Almost](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_02d1201069.html). The only red flag is Retinyl Palmitate.  \n>  \n>satisfying? Similar texture to Cosrx but I hated the scent. Smells like fresh diapers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, I bought the **Etude House Soonjung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser**. I really liked this one, so much that I used too much and nearly finished half a 70 mL bottle in two weeks. *Ooops*. This is really effective at removing makeup and sunscreen though it will sting your eyes. In fact, all of these cleansers will sting your eyes. I used to use two pumps every morning and night, which was waaaay too much. One pump is enough.\n\n>pH balanced? Yes. Could be a bit lower but oh well.  \n>  \n>non-drying? Yes.  \n>  \n>affordability and convenience? $10 USD for 150 mL on [rubyrubyshop.com](https://rubyrubyshop.com). It's not the easiest to find in store though. In Toronto, I've seen it for $20 CAD at M Brand.  \n>  \n>safe ingredients? [Yes](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_ace9345797.html)!  \n>  \n>satisfying? It is a light foam. I like it a lot. It's also unscented!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also tried the **Hada Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam**. I really wanted to enjoy this, but unfortunately it left my skin dry and dull. What a shame, it was so cheap too. T\\_T I'm using it as hand soap and shampoo now LOL. I did adore the texture of this, it is a very thick creamy foam.\n\n>pH balanced? Yes, reported as approx 5.5.  \n>  \n>non-drying? Others have said so. My skin didn't agree, unfortunately.  \n>  \n>affordability and convenience? Yes, I'd buy the refills off doko demo for approx $10 each with air shipping (5-9 days) if it had worked for me.  \n>  \n>safe ingredients? [Pretty much](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_c05c170018.html). Only flag was PEG-8.  \n>  \n>satisfying? Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeees <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, I'm currently trying the **Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing 5.5 Cleanser.** I bought it today and only used it once so my opinions on it are tentative. It has a very heavy scent, kind of like if I walked into muji and soaked myself in their scent diffusers. It comes out as a cream and becomes a slight creamy foam. Similar level of foaming to the Cosrx but it's a bit creamier.\n\n>pH balanced? Yep!  \n>  \n>non-drying? Yesss! This one left my skin really soft.  \n>  \n>affordability and convenience? Very cheap online, though not available in many sites like the Cosrx. I found it for $8.50 in store.  \n>  \n>safe ingredients? [It's all green on cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9fec221077.html). It does contain essential oils and isopropyl alcohol at the bottom of the list though.  \n>  \n>satisfying? Not as much as the Hada Labo or Soonjung.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Overall, which cleanser would I go with? Probably the Soonjung or Innisfree.** I wish the Innisfree were unscented, then it would be perfect. The soonjung has a slightly higher cleansing power than innisfree, so it is a tad more stripping but still not drying. If you don't have oily skin, stay away from the Heimish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I'm done trying cleansers, whew! I was considering trying Innisfree the Minimum Cleanser but it's a bit hard to find and only comes in a 70 mL size. Other cleansers I've looked at are the Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleanser, and the Krave Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser. But I'm broke enough, I'm going to finish my Soonjung and Innisfree Blueberry cleanser.",

The IOPE cleansing foam has the right ph in the 5s, negligible scent/virtually unscented, does not try to do anything other than clean and moisturize, does not strip the clean, does not leave a film behind, and doesn't irritate my eyes at all. I seriously use it around my eyes without any irritation. It costs 18 USD for a tube and that tube lasts me about 6 months because you only need a really small amount. IOPE's a division of Aritaum (big Korean conglomerate of skincare) and you can find at Aritaum stores in HMart if you are near a US border or online through any of the onlin3 Korean resellers.\n  \n * weird thing, so I love love love this cleanser. I even use it on my Maltese's face because it is so gentle yet works.
