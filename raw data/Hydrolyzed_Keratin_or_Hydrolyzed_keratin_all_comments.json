Attaching one pic for example. \n\nProducts affected on their site include fine shampoo and conditioner and detox shampoo. Cult beauty also labelled the wave spray as vegan  but it also contains hydrolyzed keratin. Very disappointing. Just posting in case anyone is using their products thinking they are vegan.",

If anyone is looking for a vegan bougie alternative, I recently ordered the Olaplex clarifying shampoo.\n\nI remember I also got tricked into buying makeup mislabelled as vegan on the Urban Decay website a few years ago. It was a product that actually contains honey, collagen, and elastin. ü§¢ How much more unvegan can you get?!\n\nImportant reminder to double check these things and not just blindly trust what brands and beauty websites state!",

Because that's what it feels like. Apparently, these brands just straight up don't care. They think it doesn't matter.\n\nBut it's the kind of mistake that should be *exceedingly* rare.

    "body": "‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long üòÇ\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ‚ú®Ô∏èthe search bar‚ú®Ô∏è as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST.

If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe.

If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether.

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I‚Äôve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or ‚Äúglucoside‚Äù.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or ‚Äúmethosulfate‚Äù (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt‚Äôs best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this ‚Äúprotein overload‚Äù is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it‚Äôs wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "This post is about the different hair types, common concerns, treatments, and various products available. Whether you're a haircare newbie or a pro, you all will find this post helpful.\n\n# **HAIR TYPE:**\n\nKnowing your hair type is crucial for choosing the right products and styling techniques.\n\n# 1. Straight Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Lies flat from root to tip.\n* Naturally shiny due to the even distribution of oils.\n* Can be prone to looking greasy quickly.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a lightweight shampoo to prevent excess oil buildup.\n* Avoid heavy conditioners; opt for lightweight, leave-in conditioners if needed.\n* Regularly trim to avoid split ends.\n\n# 2. Wavy Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Has a natural wave or curl pattern.\n* More volume than straight hair.\n* Can be prone to frizz and dryness.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to combat dryness.\n* Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl-enhancing cream to define waves.\n* Avoid over-washing; 2-3 times a week is sufficient.\n\n# 3. Curly Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Defined curls or ringlets.\n* More prone to dryness as natural oils struggle to travel down the hair shaft.\n* Can be prone to frizz.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a sulfate-free, moisturizing shampoo to retain natural oils.\n* Deep condition weekly to maintain moisture levels.\n* Use a curl cream or gel to define curls and reduce frizz.\n\n# 4. Coily Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Tight curls or coils.\n* Often very dry and prone to breakage.\n* Shrinks significantly when dry.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a hydrating shampoo and a rich, creamy conditioner.\n* Regularly apply leave-in conditioners and oils to maintain moisture.\n* Avoid heat styling; embrace protective styles like twists or braids.\n\n  \n# **HAIR CONCERNS:** \n\nHere are some specific hair concerns and the active ingredients that can help address them. Understanding which ingredients to look for can make a big difference in tackling your hair issues effectively.\n\n# 1. Dryness\n\n**Concern**: Hair lacks moisture and appears dull and brittle.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Argan Oil**: Rich in fatty acids and vitamin E, deeply moisturizes and adds shine.\n* **Shea Butter**: Provides intense hydration and helps lock in moisture.\n* **Glycerin**: Attracts moisture to the hair and scalp.\n\n# 2. Frizz\n\n**Concern**: Hair is unmanageable and has a rough texture, especially in humid conditions.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Silicones (e.g., Dimethicone)**: Smooth the hair cuticle and reduce frizz.\n* **Keratin**: Strengthens and smooths the hair shaft.\n* **Oils**: Penetrate the hair shaft to provide moisture and reduce frizz.\n\n# 3. Damage\n\n**Concern**: Hair is weak, breaks easily, and may have split ends.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Protein (e.g., Hydrolyzed Keratin, Silk Protein)**: Rebuilds and strengthens the hair structure.\n* **Amino Acids**: Repair and reinforce hair fibers.\n* **Panthenol (Provitamin B5)**: Penetrates hair to provide moisture and improve elasticity.\n\n# 4. Hair Loss\n\n**Concern**: Thinning hair or excessive shedding.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Minoxidil**: FDA-approved treatment that stimulates hair growth.\n* **Biotin**: Supports hair health and growth.\n* **Caffeine**: Stimulates hair follicles to promote growth.\n\n# 5. Dandruff\n\n**Concern**: Flaky, itchy scalp caused by dryness, irritation, or fungal infections.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Pyrithione Zinc**: Reduces fungal growth and scalp inflammation.\n* **Ketoconazole**: Antifungal that helps treat dandruff.\n* **Salicylic Acid**: Exfoliates the scalp to remove flakes.\n\n# 6. Oily Scalp\n\n**Concern**: Scalp produces excess oil, making hair greasy and limp.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Tea Tree Oil**: Antibacterial and antifungal properties help balance scalp oil.\n* **Charcoal**: Absorbs excess oil and impurities.\n* **Clay (e.g., Kaolin, Bentonite)**: Absorbs excess oil from the scalp and hair.\n\n# 7. Scalp Irritation\n\n**Concern**: Itchy, red, or inflamed scalp.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Aloe Vera**: Soothes and hydrates the scalp.\n* **Chamomile Extract**: Calms and reduces inflammation.\n* **Peppermint Oil**: Provides a cooling sensation and soothes irritation.\n\n# 8. Thin/Fine Hair\n\n**Concern**: Hair lacks volume and density.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Biotin**: Strengthens and thickens hair.\n* **Collagen**: Improves hair elasticity and volume.\n* **Niacin (Vitamin B3)**: Increases blood circulation to the scalp.\n\n\n\n# **How to Use Active Ingredients through Hair Products:**\n\n* **Shampoos**: Look for shampoos formulated with specific active ingredients to address your concern.\n* **Conditioners**: Complement your shampoo with a conditioner that contains beneficial ingredients.\n* **Leave-in Treatments**: For ongoing benefits, use leave-in products with active ingredients.\n* **Hair Masks**: Use weekly masks for an intensive treatment.\n* **Serums and Oils**: Apply serums or oils with targeted ingredients to problem areas.\n\n  \n# **BRANDS THAT I USE AND RECOMMEND:**\n\n* Olaplex\n* Forrest Essentials\n* The Body Shop\n* Lush\n* Kama Ayurveda\n* Love, Beauty, and Planet\n* Simrasa\n\n  \n# **LINKS:** I've used AI to help me compile the content. \n\n[Link 1](https://www.vogue.in/topics/hair-care)\n\n[Link 2](https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mens-hair-types/)",

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ‚ú®Wash-Day Bundle‚ú®\n\n# üîπCleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don‚Äôt have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn‚Äôt dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn‚Äôt enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## üîπEveryday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn‚Äôt clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn‚Äôt hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## üîπHydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/‚ÄãPalmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/‚ÄãLeaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn‚Äôt have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don‚Äôt really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn‚Äôt make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn‚Äôt bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ‚ú®Protein Duo‚ú®\n\n## üîπLeave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn‚Äôt work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn‚Äôt work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## üîπDefining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn‚Äôt as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven‚Äôt bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ‚ú®Moisture Duo‚ú®\n\n## üîπCurl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/‚ÄãPPG-8/‚Äã3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn‚Äôt help me a lot with definition though, I don‚Äôt feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## üîπCurl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn‚Äôt have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don‚Äôt mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ‚ú®Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls‚ú®\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I‚Äôd recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ‚ú®Frequently Asked Questions‚ú®\n\nüîπHow do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\nüîπHow do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Thank you for the reviews.\n\nI've seen FMC go upto 35%off on kindlife & 30%off on their own website.\n\nEdit - I have fine 2a wavy hair, & medium porosity from what I can tell. I'm hair dumb tbh. I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture. So sm1 with Frizzy or dry hair would need other more rich / moisturizing products.\n\nThe leave in cream & mousse are my more used products, I haven't quite figured out how to use the gel properly yet.",

However whether or not you'll actually notice this difference is another question. Proteins in haircare products work by forming a film on the outside of the hair.

        "body": "Oof. Depends on the type of keratin, the type and mix of the other proteins, the type of damage you are targeting and the delivery system.\n\n u/will2461 already said it: proteins are complicated. So I'd like to complicate even more :) The magic we would want is a protein that mirrors our own and can attach to it in a mirror image where it has missing bits and pieces. There are a number of things to this, but I'll highlight composition, molecular weight, and electric change.\n\nThe first part, composition, is why many products use multiple proteins. Hair keratin is made up of a bunch of amino acids in different proportions. Most natural sources of protein are not  bioidentical to keratin, so you mix and match to get a good dose of half-cystine (reduced cystine) proline, serine, etc etc. There are products available to formulators that set out to create a bioidentical mix of amino acids, so you end up with vegetable keratin, for example.\n\nThe second part is molecular weight, or how big, on average, the molecules are. In short, proteins are huge vis-a-vis hair molecules, thus they get hydrolized. Once hydrolized, the liquid is a soup of amino acids, peptide and assorted sized chunks, no longer arranged in a single protein molecule. The average size of all this is important to hair. If you are after film-forming cuticle protection, larger molecular weight is good. For functions that require cortex repleninshment, smaller molecular sizes can actually penetrate the cuticle into the cortex.\n\nLastly, areas of damage in the hair fiber exhibit negative charges. To be substantive to hair proteins need to have enough positive charge to attach to those areas and resist rinsing. On top of 'normal' substantivity, proteins can be quaternized, which increases that positive charge so they attach to keratin with a stronger bond.\n\nThe ideal then is a mix of small and larger molecular weight amino acids covering the gamut of keratin, in a delivery system that allows for it to stick around either bc of no rinse or bc it is strongly chemically attached to the hair fiber.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sources**\n\nThis is all knowledge I learned a while back, so had to hunt down sources,  and this is a mix of academic knowledge, blogs and industry insider. Take with skepticism, do your research, etc:\n\n[Chemical Composition of Different Hair types](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-25611-0_2), in Robbins, C.

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

The... jug of shampoo... says that it's \"for use on horses, cattle, llamas, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits\" with a curious lack of \"human\". It doesn't recommend against it, but I'm still concerned. \n\nThe ingredients noted on the front of the bottle are Aloe, Keratin, and Oat protien. The extended list is:\n\n>  De-Ionized Water, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, Ammonium laureth sulfate, Cocomidopropyl Betatine, cocomid MEA, Glycerin, Clyceryl stearate, Aloe vera, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Oat protien, Vitamin A/D/E, mine/wintergreen fragarance, DMDH Hydantoin, yellow#5, Blue#1\n\nI'm not looking for the best shampoo, but just want to make sure that I can reasonably use this.

This is just reference for you guys! :)\n\nMost hair needs some amount of protein, especially damaged(sun, wind, heat, bleach, etc) hair. Normal hair, or protein sensitive hair does not need large doses of protein all the time. If your hair feels stiff, frizzy, and dry, then your hair might be getting to much protein.  \n\nFor some fine/damaged curlies, protein will make your curls spring to life like never before!! Careful- It can be addicting and turn into a case of \"too much of a good thing\".  Don't worry- if you go overboard on protein treatments, you can just do a good deep conditioning treatment to help counteract the protein overload. :)  So if you have damaged hair that needs protein, how often should you do it?  If it's an INTENSE level of protein, once a week. If it's a conditioner that has some protein in it, every other day or even every day(if it's low enough on the ingredient list) will be fine.  This is why hair porosity is important: Low porosities probably do not need any protein, normal could use some protein, but high porosity LOVES protein. :)\n\nOKAY. Here's the list of commonly used proteins.  Looked for the actual word \"protein\", \"keratin\" or for the word \"hydrolyzed\" to indicate a protein in most cases.\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed casein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed hair keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed rice protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl silk amino acids\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Keratin\n\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed soy protein",

I just switched to AG Haircare Volume Shampoo (with the matching conditioner) and I love how my hair looks after use. It takes care of almost all frizz, gives me gorgeous volume, and contains sulfates (something I definitely need in a shampoo). BUT, it does not feel like it cleans my scalp as well as other shampoos, despite having that \"stripping\" feeling in the shower. Now if this was 2014, I'd think I was \"over-drying my hair and it was producing more oil\" but alas, updated information.\n\n**My question:** Why can I can barely get it to lather? I don't have super hard water, and I can lather other shampoos much easier than this one. What determines the lathering level in a shampoo? \\*Side note, I have heard that lather has little to do with cleansing level of a shampoo, but I'm not sure if thats a myth or not because it sounds anti-sulfate to me.\n\n**Shampoo Ingredients:** Aqua (Water/Eau), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Propylene Glycol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Tilia Tomentosa Bud Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Prunus Serotina (Wild Cherry) Bark Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Keratin, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate, VP/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzophenone-4, Tetrasodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, CI 19140 (Yellow 5), CI 42090 (Blue 1), Citric Acid.",

I couldn't find many reviews for hand masks, so I thought I'd start offering mine. Here are little reviews of the four I have tried so far, from the most to least hydrating.    \nHere‚Äôs the TL; DR summary: the Absolute are the most moisturizing and the only one that isn‚Äôt scented like cheap grandma perfume, but the Smart Hand Milky Moisture are a bargain at half the price and the only ones with a built in adhesive tab to adjust them to your wrists. Tip: for ones without a built in sticky tab, you can use a hair tie around your wrist more easily than scotch taping once you are gloved.\n\n\n**Absolute New York Repair and Care Hand Mask in Tangerine**    \n**Purchased:** Hmart on sale for $3, regular price $4    \n**Ingredients:** Tangerine Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Tangerine Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA Hand Mask ‚Äì Rose Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Rose Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA    \n**Thoughts:** This one has a strong tangerine scent, no surprise. I was worried the tangerine would be irritating, but it seemed fine. This mask was so effective at moisturizing my sad parched hand that it convinced me to try the others. My Hmart only had this version, but it comes in rose, green tea, and black pearl, all identical formulas except for the main extract and fragrance.\n\n**Repiel Smart Hand Mask Milky Moisture**     \n**Purchase:** Amazon, box of 10 for $20, even cheaper on ebay    \nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Urea, Glyceryl Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1.2-Hexanediol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Illicium Verum(Anise)Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Arginine, Milk Protein Extract, Goat Milk Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Allantoin, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate    \nThoughts: The standard scent for hand masks appears to be cheap grandma perfume: powdery, soapy floral smell. Except for the first tangerine one, these all smell like grandma in varying degrees. These ones have a medium strength scent that blessedly doesn‚Äôt linger. The essence in these is not quite as moisturizing as the Absolute ones, but it‚Äôs still good. Annoyingly, it‚Äôs not well distributed, at least in the box I got--it‚Äôs concentrated in the fingers but the thumb of the gloves doesn‚Äôt ever seem to have any, so I have to squish it down into the hand part and then squish my hand around in them for a minute to get the essence properly distributed. What I do like about these is that they have a built in adhesive tab at the wrist. So, after you get them on, you can easily tape them closed tight at the wrist to seal in that moisture goodness. At about half the price of the Absolute, it‚Äôs pretty easy to forgive the failings.\n\n**Skin Food Shea Butter Hand Mask**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Honey Extract, Milk Protein Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Disodium Edta, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance    \n**Experience:** I was sooo disappointed that these smelled like grandma, because I expected a pleasant shea butter smell. They don‚Äôt smell like shea butter at all, and the moistuzing power is so-so. They also have alcohol pretty high in the ingredients list, which doesn‚Äôt impress me in skincare, and even less in something meant to moisturize. \n\n\n**The Face Shop Rich Hand V Special Care**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, dimethicone, butylene glycol, glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, citrus paradis (grapefruit) extract, glyceryl sterate, peg-100 sterate, urea, cetearyl alcohol, alcohol, sorbitan sesquioleate, cyclopentasiloxane, sodium polyacrylate, acrylates/C10-20 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, hydrogenated polydecene, potassium hydroxide, dimethiconol, adenosine, trideceth-6, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, fragrance    \n**Experience:** These have a much milder grandma scent than the others, further mitigated with a pleasant base note of shea or cocoa butter smell, which is weird since they don‚Äôt contain either. They were the juiciest feeling hand mask I tried, and I had high hopes for them. Unfortunately, they did virtually nothing. I was honestly amazed at how ineffectual these were for moisturizing, and I can only guess the difference between this and the other masks I tried is due to the dimethicone so high in the ingredients list and lack of more effective moisturizing oil, at least for my skin. \n",

For background, I am a stylist, and had a former coworker who always advised not to use conditioners with hydrolyzed wheat protein if you have hair extensions. I got new human hair extensions installed in November, and didn‚Äôt look at the ingredients in the conditioner I was using (rookie mistake I guess?). I noticed that my extensions are full of split ends, despite using what I thought were good products. Checked my conditioners, most of them have hydrolyzed protein of some sort, and even my hair spray has hydrolyzed wheat protein üò´ \n\nJust wondering if anyone can explain why the hydrolyzed proteins would damage the extensions, and if it is only hydrolyzed wheat protein that could be damaging, or if any hydrolyzed protein would do the same damage (I‚Äôve seen hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed oat protein, hydrolyzed silk, and hydrolyzed keratin on the product labels I checked). My understanding is that the extensions don‚Äôt require the extra protein that damaged or natural hair does, and the extra protein causes the extensions to break from being over-protenized.",

I lucked in to some very awesome products when I started doing CG, and for the first time in my life I fell in love with my hair. However, finding my \"holy grail\" so early meant I never really experimented or tried things. ¬†Now my products have been discontinued one by one, leaving me scrambling for similar replacements, and it's just not working. On paper, It looks like I pick the right things, but my hair is so sad now. It's just lackluster. Limp, kind of flat, feels dry no matter what I've tried. My curls are just wavy now. Nothing else has changed¬† as far as the style, dye, or routine.\n¬†\nI don't mind paying ¬†for pricey products that work, but I don't even know where to start at this point and I don't want to keep paying tons of money for more products that aren't doing anything for me. Any recs, products or otherwise, are much appreciated.\n\n\nEdit: My HG products were Spiral Solutions Caitlyn's conditioner mixed with a tiny bit of Spiral Solutions Repairing Protein Treatment, then Redken Soft Spin 05 gel, diffused with low heat and/or air dried.

The simplest way to explain it is that the b3 works like doubled sided tape inside each hair strand and helps the strands reform as one strand. This treatment is only designed to last 6ish weeks, and is not a permanent long term fix.\nAlmost all products sold as a split end ‚Äúrepair‚Äù treatment will not actually repair the split ends. They‚Äôre most likely smoothing the hair shaft to give the appearance of less split ends, and it washes out when you wash your hair.

She told me that ‚ÄúLove Beauty & Planet‚Äú is their most vegan friendly brand but I have yet to receive the email she promised with more info, I might chase up later today\n\nI also, yesterday, spoke to a Proctor & Gamble, a lovely lady called Olivia was the agent, they make my shampoo (Head and Shoulders).  They do no animal testing and invest a lot of their profits into animal welfare but cannot guarantee anything they make is fully vegan, they do their best to try to source ingredients from veggie sources but when there is a shortage they will revert to animal products.  I made a post on this yesterday and some kind Redditor provided me with the following link if this is on anyone else‚Äôs agenda.\n\nhttps://metro.co.uk/2018/05/18/guide-100-vegan-cruelty-free-shampoo-conditioner-7081038/\n\nWell on to the topic at hand, this morning I called my deodorant manufacturer, Nivea, to see if their products were vegan friendly.\n\nGents, I am happy to confirm that Nivea Men, Black and White, Invisible Original is totally animal byproducts free and is not tested on animals.  The agent i spoke to, Rebecca, said the only place they test on animals in their range is China as it‚Äôs a legal requirement there.\n\nShe said not *all* their products are free form animal byproducts, but kindly sent me an an email of which ingredients to avoid, I‚Äôll copy below for your benefit! I hope you find it beneficial.\n\n>Dear Matt,\n\n>Thank you very much for your call.\n\n>Whilst most ingredients used within our Beiersdorf product ranges are synthetic or plant derived (non-animal sources) there are a handful of ingredients that are animal derived. We can confirm that the Glycerin used within our products is however vegetable based and we do not use any egg based ingredients. Due to the presence of animal derived ingredients in a selected number of our products, we do not claim that our products are Halal or Vegan friendly.\n\n>As per our telephone conversation please find below the list of animal ingredients that we use in our NIVEA products:\n\n>Carboxymethyl Chitin  crustacean\n\n>Cera Alba  bee (x)\n\n>Cholesterol sheep, woolwax\n\n>Cholesteryl Chloride sheep, woolwax\n\n>Cholesteryl Nonanoate sheep, woolwax\n\n>Cholesteryl Oleyl Carbonate sheep, woolwax\n\n>CI 75470 cochineal insect\n\n>Glyceryl Lanolate     sheep, woolwax\n\n>Hydrolyzed Collagen codfish swim bladder\n\n>Hydrolyzed Keratin sheep, wool OR cashmere goat, wool\n\n>Hydrolyzed Milk Protein cattle, milk\n\n>Hydrolyzed Pearl freshwater pearls\n\n>Hydrolyzed Silk silk worm\n\n>Lactose cattle, milk\n\n>Lanolin  sheep, woolwax\n\n>Lanolin Alcohol     sheep, woolwax\n\n>Mel bee\n\n>Ostrea Shell Extract oyster shells\n\n>PEG-8 Beeswax    bee\n\n>Serica Powder silk worm\n\n>Sine Adipe Lac cattle, milk\n\n>5Sodium Tallowate cattle, tallow\n\n>Soluble Collagen pork\n\n>Synthetic Beeswax bee",

Each leaf is composed of three layers: 1) An inner clear gel that contains 99% water and rest is made of glucomannans, amino acids, lipids, sterols and vitamins. 2) The middle layer of latex which is the bitter yellow sap and contains anthraquinones and glycosides. 3) The outer thick layer of 15‚Äì20 cells called as rind which has protective function and synthesizes carbohydrates and proteins. Inside the rind are vascular bundles responsible for transportation of substances such as water (xylem) and starch (phloem).  \n>  \n>It contains 8 enzymes: aliiase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, bradykinase, carboxypeptidase, catalase, cellulase, lipase, and peroxidase. Bradykinase helps to reduce excessive inflammation when applied to the skin topically, while others help in the breakdown of sugars and fats. [^((Enzymes are proteins))](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme)  \n>  \n>Recently, a glycoprotein with antiallergic properties, called alprogen and novel anti-inflammatory compound, C-glucosyl chromone, has been isolated from Aloe vera gel. \n\nSo we know that the gel has proteins, but you find \"aloe vera juice\" listed in the ingredients of a lot of hair products. This is diluted gel. Aloe vera juice is commercially available in two varieties, \"whole leaf\" and \"inner filet.\" [The whole leaf kind is made out of the gel and the latex](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/is-drinking-aloe-vera-juice-good-for-you/). From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe_vera):\n\n>Two substances from *Aloe vera* ‚Äì a clear gel and its yellow [latex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex) ‚Äì are used to manufacture commercial products. Aloe gel typically is used to make topical medications for skin conditions, such as burns, wounds, frostbite, rashes, psoriasis, cold sores, or dry skin. Aloe latex is used individually or manufactured as a product with other ingredients to be ingested for relief of constipation. Aloe latex may be obtained in a dried form called *resin* or as \"aloe dried juice\".\n\nThe wikipedia page on [organic latex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex) tells us that latexes contain proteins as well. So whether it's the gel or latex being used, it has protein. Now the question is, is the protein small enough for your hair to absorb into the cortex? And if it isn't, is it still a problem?\n\n[https://www.curlynikki.com/2015/03/benefits-of-aloe-vera-gel-for.html](https://www.curlynikki.com/2015/03/benefits-of-aloe-vera-gel-for.html)\n\n>Aloe vera gel also contains small amounts of the protein lectin, as well as various amino acids. These can be absorbed into the cortex of hair, **to greater extents by hair with greater porosity,** where they can add structural integrity to the hair. However, some hair types become overly stiff and brittle or dry when protein accumulates on or in it, so it is wise to be aware of the presence of these materials in anything applied to the hair. The balance of the components in aloe vera gel include several vitamins, organic fatty acids and triglycerides, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, proteins, simple sugars and other compounds.\n\n[https://www.bellanaija.com/2019/11/nicole-ezeh-aloe-vera-dries-out-your-low-porosity-hair-heres-why/](https://www.bellanaija.com/2019/11/nicole-ezeh-aloe-vera-dries-out-your-low-porosity-hair-heres-why/)\n\n>It leaves low porosity hair brittle because the compound similar to keratin contained in aloe vera is too bulky for the cuticles to absorb. The cuticles can only absorb hydrolyzed keratin i.e. keratin degraded to smaller amino acids.\n\nThis suggests that proteins not absorbed by the hair shaft are still potentially drying or problematic in another way. I'm going to have to do more research on this. The claim that lectin is absorbed by high/medium porosity hair but not low porosity is unsubstantiated and doesn't make much sense because [lectins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectin) are a class of proteins, not a specific protein. The fact that they bind to carbohydrates so easily indicates that they are larger than hydrolyzed keratin but it doesn't prove they can be absorbed by medium or high porosity hair either.\n\nThere are a variety of amino acids and enzymes in aloe vera gel, and [amino acids with a low molecular weight can make it into the cortex](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111401_Hair_and_amino_acids_The_Interactions_and_the_effects#:~:text=Low%20molecular%20weight%20peptides%20and,%5D%5B15%5D%20%5B16%5D%20). [The average weight of an amino acid is 110 Daltons, and glycine is 75](https://www.promega.com/resources/tools/amino-acid-chart-amino-acid-structure/#). Because of the glycosides in the sap and the glycoprotein alprogen, it seems like it contains significant amounts of glycine (if anyone who actually knows anything beyond high school chemistry wants to correct me on this, please do!)  But I'm fairly confident in saying some of those amino acids are making it into your cortex, which leaves less room for moisture whether or not they are forming full proteins. This is probably why people say aloe \"acts like a protein.\"\n\nI would recommend avoiding it, or once out of protein overload, introducing it before introducing other forms of protein and observing if it puts you back in overload.",

WASH YOUR HAIR!! i cannot stress this enough. when i first started trying to grow my hair, i used to go a disgusting amount of time without washing my hair while using oils and stuff. i was 14 so i guess i can (somewhat) use my age as an excuse, but if you're around that age and reading this right now (or any age for that matter), DONT DO THIS!! i have extremely curly hair so washing my hair more often than every 3-4 days max really dries it out, but i waited way too long and i was using a bunch of other things in my hair at the same time. it actually slowed down my hair growth a lot.\n\n4. a product i recommend is called Wild Growth Oil. you can get it off of amazon for $11 CAD plus shipping and it made my hair grow stupid fast and it grew super healthy. it's really good for facial hair too, it's thickened up my teenage bum fluff on my face\n\n5. biotin pills. biotin is good for your integumentary system and promotes healthy nails, skin, and hair. i noticed a difference within the first month of using it. \n\n6. peppermint essential oil. i use this on my hair 1 or 2 times a day, depending on if i shower or not. every morning for sure. this promotes blood flow in your scalp and helps clear out the follicles. however, like anything else, it can build up (can cause a lot of dandruff and itchiness), so don't use this as an excuse to not wash your hair (like i did at 14). \n\n7. a good blend: coconut oil, 2-5 (broken open) vitamin e capsules), peppermint oil, castle oil, olive oil. i use this once a week and i really make sure my hair is saturated before i shower (a routine i will also share)\n\n8. i use a keratin conditioner. i take some hydrolyzed keratin, any sulfate free conditioner, 2 egg yolks, vitamin e, and olive oil (can add essential oils to make it smell good). i apply that and leave it in for an hour before shampooing with COLD WATER also using a sulfate free shampoo. i apply argan oil while it's wet. \n\n9. the last and most obvious tip: wait. just be patient. it'll grow on its own even if you don't do all these things, but these are for anyone whose hair maybe grows slower or who may wanna speed up the process or anyone else who may have had a haircut gone wrong. hope this helped anyone who wanted it!",

I used to use Aussie products and for years 3 Minute Miracle was my go-to conditioner and it always treated me well.  About 1.5 years ago I switched to Nexxus Keraphix because I was hoping to add some weight to my hair.  It has always dried really light and fluffy, if that makes sense.  I liked Keraphix and it did what I was hoping, making my hair feel thicker and heavier.  However in about the last 5 months or so my hair suddenly became REALLY tangly.\n\nWhile I'm washing  and conditioning it it hard to get my fingers through my hair. I know you aren't supposed to brush wet hair, but I used to be able to slide a brush right through with no issues and now when I get out of the shower it is a nightmare getting a comb through it. Even a wide-tooth comb is hard as it knots up right away.  I'm 40 years old and this is a completely brand new thing for me.  I have no idea what is going on.  I have used dry shampoo and leave-in argan oil occasionally as well.  I've tried using a couple other random shampoo/conditioner combos to see if maybe it is the Keraphix for some reason, but the results were the same.  I have also been getting knots in my hair while I sleep which is a new thing, too.  Any thoughts or advice are welcome.  I feel like my hair is ruined!  Below are the Keraphix ingredients in case that is helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I've been reading more on the sidebar.

        "body": "I think the problem could be too much protein. Keratin is a protein and there are other proteins as well in those products. When your hair gets too much protein it causes issues- like making it dry, brittle, and tangly. You may consider a moisturizing deep treatment and switch to a shampoo and conditioner that doesn't include keratin or other proteins. Our hair needs the right balance of protein and moisture or it tends to tangle easily. So of course too much moisture can also be an issue so once you get to a balance you may want to rotate your current shampoo and conditioner with a moisturizing one to maintain the balance. \nI wouldn't worry much about brushing it wet. Use a detangling brush and have conditioner or detangler in while brushing. I've got curly hair and when it's wet it literally the only time curly hair can be brushed so that's how we detangle our hair. But once you get your hair balanced you should have an easier time detangling it when dry, assuming your hair is relatively straight.",

    "body": "The following two routines were generated by AI and have not been tested and may be erroneous. I am sharing them not as a recommendation, but to provide some ideas that might be worth investigating. It is interesting to note that the routines appear to be referencing some obscure patents for keratin plug removal. Also, keep in mind that the prompt instructs the AI for a \"novel and unconventional\" routine, so it is intentionally avoiding common routines that are already known.\n\n# AI Routine 1:\n\n**Model:** o3-mini\n\n**Prompt:** You are en expert in dermatology, dermocosmetics and the chemistry of keratinization. Using your knowledge of dermatology and dermocosmetics, propose a novel and unconventional routine, using commonly found cosmetic ingredients, that a patient could use to dissolve built-up keratin plugs on their face. Don't be afraid to suggest something that has never been tried before. Anything is on the table.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo dissolve keratin plugs on the face using commonly found cosmetic ingredients, here is a novel and unconventional routine that combines keratolytic, enzymatic, and chemical approaches. The goal is to break down keratin efficiently while maintaining skin health:\n\n**Proposed Routine**\n\n# 1.¬†Pre-Treatment: Softening the Keratin Plug\n\n* Ingredient: **Urea (10-20%)**\n   * Urea acts as a keratolytic agent by breaking down the bonds between keratinocytes and hydrating the skin simultaneously \\[[2](https://thenakedchemist.com/keratosis-pillaris/)\\].\n   * Apply a urea-based cream or serum to the affected areas and leave it on for 10-15 minutes to soften the keratin plug.\n\n# 2.¬†Enzymatic Dissolution\n\n* Ingredient: **Keratinase or Papain/Bromelain Enzymes**\n   * Use a mask or serum containing proteolytic enzymes like keratinase (if available) or natural alternatives such as papain (from papaya) or bromelain (from pineapple). These enzymes specifically digest keratin proteins \\[[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1476vkm/dissolving_keratin/), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8052392/)\\].\n   * Apply the enzyme product over the softened plugs and let it sit for 10 minutes. This step targets the proteinaceous core of the plugs.\n\n# 3.¬†Chemical Exfoliation\n\n* Ingredients: **Salicylic Acid (2%) + Lactic Acid (5-10%)**\n   * Salicylic acid penetrates deeply into pores, dissolving sebum and keratin, while lactic acid exfoliates and hydrates \\[[2](https://thenakedchemist.com/keratosis-pillaris/), [3](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/6/220)\\].\n   * Combine these in a serum or mask formulation. Apply after enzymatic treatment to further break down residual keratin and exfoliate surrounding dead skin cells.\n\n# 4.¬†Alkaline Disruption\n\n* Ingredient: **Arginine (5-10%) at pH 9-10**\n   * Use an arginine-based solution with a mildly alkaline pH to disrupt protein aggregation within the plug.

This protocol leverages underutilized biochemical interactions between common cosmetic ingredients to disrupt keratin aggregates while maintaining epidermal integrity‚Äîa critical balance often overlooked in conventional regimens.\n\n# Biochemical Foundations of Keratin Disruption\n\n# Proteolytic Enzyme Activation via pH Modulation\n\nThe cornerstone of this approach lies in sequential pH manipulation to optimize enzymatic activity. Papain (from¬†*Carica papaya*) and bromelain (from¬†*Ananas comosus*) exhibit maximal proteolytic function at pH 5.0-7.0, precisely targeting keratin's disulfide bonds \\[[6](https://ijdvl.com/n-acetylcysteine-in-dermatology/)\\].¬†Pre-treatment with mildly acidic toners containing¬†**mandelic acid**¬†(pH 3.5-4.0) creates an optimal microenvironment for enzyme activation while initiating corneocyte detachment through Œ±-hydroxy acid action \\[[5](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulas-products/skin-care/blog/21837612/keratolytic-treatments-for-acne-a-review)\\].\n\nThis dual-phase system achieves:\n\n1. **Primary Desquamation**: 2% mandelic acid disrupts stratum corneum adhesion proteins\n2. **Secondary Proteolysis**: 0.5% papain/bromelain blend degrades keratin fibrils\n3. **Tertiary Chelation**: 1% phytic acid binds residual calcium ions maintaining corneocyte cohesion \\[[2](https://www.nescens.com/en-us/products/keratolytic-complex)\\]\n\n# Phase I: Keratin Matrix Decrosslinking\n\n# Overnight Linoleate-Lactate Wrap\n\nInnovative use of¬†**linoleic acid**¬†(0.5%) in combination with¬†**ammonium lactate**¬†(4%) creates a biomimetic lipid matrix that penetrates keratinized follicles. The œâ-6 fatty acid fluidizes sebaceous plugs while lactate's hygroscopic properties swell keratinocytes, increasing susceptibility to subsequent exfoliants \\[[3](https://www.ibigroup.com/around-the-world/keratin-buildup-on-face-causes-prevention-and-treatment.html)\\].\n\n*Mechanistic advantage*: Linoleate's cis-configuration induces lateral packing defects in keratin Œ≤-sheets, enhancing lactobionic acid penetration \\[[2](https://www.nescens.com/en-us/products/keratolytic-complex)\\].\n\n# Phase II: Multi-Axis Corneocyte Disassembly\n\n# Triphasic Exfoliation Cocktail\n\n1. **N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) 5%** Thiol groups reduce keratin disulfide bonds while upregulating filaggrin proteolysis[6](https://ijdvl.com/n-acetylcysteine-in-dermatology/)\n2. **Salicyloyl Phytosphingosine 1%** Combines Œ≤-hydroxy acid desquamation with ceramide precursor delivery\n3. **Urea-Encapsulated Gluconolactone 5%** Sustained-release system maintains stratum corneum hydration during keratolysis \\[[4](https://www.medicoverhospitals.in/diseases/keratin-plugs/)\\]\n\n*Clinical rationale*: NAC's mucolytic action synergizes with salicylate's follicular penetration, while urea prevents compensatory hyperkeratinization through aquaporin modulation \\[[6](https://ijdvl.com/n-acetylcysteine-in-dermatology/)\\].\n\n# Phase III: Follicular Remodeling\n\n# Circadian-Targeted Retinoid Delivery\n\nNightly application of¬†**hydroxypinacolone retinoate**¬†(0.1%) combined with¬†**bakuchiol**¬†(0.5%) provides retinoid-like effects without epidermal disruption. The complex upregulates retinoic acid receptor-Œ≥ (RARŒ≥) specifically in follicular epithelium, normalizing keratinocyte differentiation cycles \\[[5](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulas-products/skin-care/blog/21837612/keratolytic-treatments-for-acne-a-review)\\].\n\n*Innovative twist*: Morning use of¬†**dihydroxyacetone 2%**¬†creates transient follicular occlusion, enhancing retinoid penetration depth by 38% (based on in silico modeling).\n\n# Phase IV: Barrier Synchronization\n\n# Adaptive Moisturization Matrix\n\nA ceramide-phytosterol blend containing:\n\n* **Ceramide EOP**¬†(0.25%)\n* **Œ≤-Sitosterol**¬†(0.5%)\n* **Squalane**¬†(3%)\n\nmaintains barrier function during intensive exfoliation. The system dynamically adjusts lipid ratios based on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) rates detected via formulation-responsive humectants \\[[3](https://www.ibigroup.com/around-the-world/keratin-buildup-on-face-causes-prevention-and-treatment.html)\\].\n\n# Clinical Protocol\n\n**PM Routine**\n\n1. **Precleanse**: Oat kernel flour (colloidal) + papain powder dry brush\n2. **Activation Toner**: Mandelic acid 2% + zinc ricinoleate\n3. **Decrosslinking Serum**: NAC 5% + linoleoyl lactate\n4. **Occlusive Mask**: Bentonite + dihydroxyacetone 2% (20 min)\n5. **Retinoid Complex**: HPR + bakuchiol in squalane base\n\n**AM Routine**\n\n1. **Enzyme Rinse**: Bromelain 0.2% + gluconolactone 5%\n2. **Stabilizing Fluid**: Phytic acid 1% + ceramide EOP\n3. **Adaptive Moisturizer**: Œ≤-sitosterol/squalane matrix\n\n# Mechanistic Validation\n\nIn vitro testing demonstrates 83% reduction in artificial keratin plugs after 8 cycles (p<0.01) compared to standard salicylic acid protocols. Confocal microscopy reveals complete follicular clearance without stratum corneum compromise \\[[2](https://www.nescens.com/en-us/products/keratolytic-complex), [5](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulas-products/skin-care/blog/21837612/keratolytic-treatments-for-acne-a-review)\\].¬†The circadian retinoid component shows 2.1x greater keratinocyte turnover versus tretinoin 0.025% in follicular epithelium models \\[[5](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulas-products/skin-care/blog/21837612/keratolytic-treatments-for-acne-a-review)\\].\n\nThis paradigm-shifting approach redefines keratin plug management through coordinated action on:\n\n1.

        "body": "I'm a little confused on how they did that too, tbh :/. My best guess is that the hydroxypropyl starch phosphate thats helping the cetearyl alcohol into the formula. In some cases it functions as a thickener or texture enhancer and in other cases it funxtions as a mild surfactant and emulsifier (it helps stabilize emulsions, and increase viscosity). So both ingredients might be helping each other. \n\nIf this is the case then your 25% cetearyl alcohol and 13% grapeseed oil is far too much. In fact, that's a lot for any formula and you need to bring the cetearyl alcohol down to like 1 to 5% in my opinion. And the grapeseed oil to like 3% max. Looking at the way matcha boost looks, even if you had a propper emulsifier your version would be far too thick.\n\nThat means everything after that should be less than them, but since they are the water soluble ingredients it's up to you yo change it or not. Your distilled water definitely needs to be at least 75% of your formula.\n\nOtherwise, if this isn't the case, their ingredient list isn't making much sense to me.\n\n Hope i could be of help.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that the cetearyl alcohol and colza oil may be there for just some added emolliency. So the main thickener might just be the hydroxypropyl starch phosphate with some help from the cetearyl alcohol. I would still look at my suggestions to see if it helps,a and just do some extra thinking. I have no idea how much hydroxypropyl starch phosphate is needed in the formula so it will really require some testing.",

I have a really weird type of hair it's hard to explain but its messy all the time people always said my hair has multiple whorls so if it sticks up at 3 places.  tho i guess if i have to categorize in those 4 categories it would be just straight short hair.\nSo here is my dilema i wanna finally take the next step to cut off shampoo completely ,but i dont really have alot of money at the moment. so i wanted to ask would it be alright to use a cheap conditioner for now ? i think it has some bad stuff in it im gonna list ingredients at the end of the post but i really have no option for more expensive stuf and baking soda makes my hair feel dirty i don't know why:I. so should i just continue my rare shampoo using for now or cut it off completely for conditioner.

However, I can find nothing on the protein that they base their entire brand around:  Alpha Keratin 60ku. There is a little information about the protein on one of their webpages ([click here to view](https://www.virtuelabs.com/en/blog/how-its-made-alpha-keratin-60ku.html)), but I am always very reluctant to trust \"scientific\" information when it is presented on a brand's website and heavily marketed. They *are* trying to sell it, after all.  \n\n\nVirtue claims that Alpha Keratin 60ku is \"almost identical\" to the keratin found in human hair (although Sephora claims that it is 100% identical on all Virtue products). Virtue also alleges that since Alpha Keratin 60ku is so close to the \"real keratin,\" that it performs much better than any other keratin product out there. I have been unable to find ANY data that would support this claim, but I wanted to see if anyone happens to have a link to any studies that have been done on Alpha Keratin 60ku specifically. Is it actually any better than products that utilize other forms of keratin, or is the difference negligible?   \n\n\nAlso, feel free to share your experiences with the brand! I'm intrigued by Virtue, but I would hate to shell out over $100 per bottle of conditioner / shampoo without seeing some substantial evidence that this product will do what it says. Thanks all :)",

They talk about how it's unlikely that the keratin is derived from human hair due to regulations around sourcing human-derived ingredients, and actually hydrolized keratin derived from wool is the most closely matched to human hair as far as the distribution of amino acids (the building blocks of protein).  It's more likely to be synthesized to have a very similar composition to human hair.\n\nRegarding the claims about it making hair stronger & repairing damage, they felt those claims were overblown; keratin can't get into the hair shaft and go exactly where it's supposed to go and rebuild it.  Perry compared it to a sweater with a hole in it; you can't take yarn and just dump it on the hole and expect the hole to be repaired just because the yarn is made of the same material as the sweater.  There's more to it than that to repair a hole, it needs to be stitched together.  Similarly, applying keratin to human hair topically will not truly repair damage, no matter how similar in composition it is to the keratin in human hair.  That being said, the other chemist (Valerie George) said she has used Virtue products and the performance is nice, but it's probably not their special keratin that's making them nice.",

The cornerstone of the line is [New Wash](http://www.shophairstory.com/www/product/869693000106), which is basically a fancy co-wash. I tried it and I love it (like, really love it). It does all the things it says it will and it made my hair lovely, but it's $40 for 8 oz and I went through that in about 4 washes. Since I can't afford to spend $10 every time I wash my hair, I was wondering if anyone could recommend a conditioner with similar ingredients that I could try. \n\n**New Wash ingredients:**\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Stearyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Gluconolactone, Rosa Centifolia Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Panthenol, Rosa Canina Seed Extract, Equisetum Hiemale Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Keratin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Menthyl Lactate, Ceteareth-20, Isopropyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate.",

My hair is not good in elasticity at all and I know that an increase of moisture should be the solution of this problem  (I've already tried with the Manuka Honey one and some deeply moisturizing mielle products) but for me it was the opposite. I've never used any protein for year but now if I don't use them my hair lacks of elasticity, they tangles a lot and seems very dry, thin and lifeless. So, since I used this deep conditioning mask for almost 2 months now (1x week), all this troubles disappeared.  \n\n\nTalking about the mask itself, I have used this one (from iHerb):  \n\\->  **SheaMoisture, Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque, 12 oz (340 g)**   \n( Water, cetearyl alcohol, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, glycerin (vegetable), butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter\\*‚ô•, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium methosulfate, fragrance, behentrimonium chloride, panthenol, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed wheat starch, cetrimonium chloride, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, mangifera indica (mango) seed butter, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) leaf extract, mauritia flexuosa (buriti) fruit oil, yeast extract, hydrolyzed keratin, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, tocopherol, niacin, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, acetic acid (apple cider), hydrogenated vegetable oil, glycine soja (soybean) oil, trifolium pratense (clover) flower extract, caramel, triethyl citrate, caprylyl glycol, benzoic acid.)  \n\n\nBut now I see two version of the formula in different stores, the \"second\" one is easier to find than the one that I used. Which should I buy? I think that if this first one worked for me, I should stick with it, but the other one is more common in stores. \n\nThis is the formula of the second one that I found (from LookFantastic but I think the same formula from Boots too):  \n\\->  (Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter\\* \\*\\*, Stearyl Alcohol, Parfum, Panthenol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Olea Europaea Husk Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Yeast Extract, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Niacinamide, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Trifolium Pratense Flower Extract, Caramel, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Acetum, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextran.)  \n\n\nWhat do you think it is better? Which one should I buy? I heard that Shea Moisture changed formula and people are not happy about it. Maybe the first one is the old formula. What do you think?  \nThanks for reading and for the suggestions already. Have a good day.",

Hair is made of protein and protein can help with curl structure and strength (again read the blog post). The recommendation I‚Äôve seen is people with low porosity hair can have a little protein in one or two products or do a protein treatment once a month. Best practice is to try adding a little protein to your routine and try it once or twice to see how your hair reacts then switch off to a non-protein product for a few washes to see how your hair reacts. My hair is low porosity and fine and I currently use protein in my deep conditioner and gel and it is a little too much on the protein side of the protein-moisture balance. So I bought a moisture-only deep conditioner and for a few weeks I‚Äôm going to see if alternating my protein DC and my new moisture DC will help balance my hair.\n\n*exceptions if your hair is protein sensitive \n\nMy advice: if your budget allows get two deep conditioners (one with protein, one with moisture) or look for samples and travel sizes to try out a few DCs without committing to a whole tub of product. \n\nOne cautionary note: if you go with your second deep conditioner, it has glycerin high on its list. Glycerin works best in a certain temperant range of temperature, so if you are in a location that is has cold, dry air right now that product could cause frizz depending on your routine.",

I've read that cocamidopropyl betaine can easily remove amodimethicone (even regular dimethicone) without being harsh on your hair.

Is it high enough on the list though to make a difference?\n\nI've also looked for heat protectants that are silicone free or contain water soluble silicones only. My search has been unsuccessful... products with water-soluble silicones only that are high up in the ingredient list are basically unicorns that are impossible to find, and the options that don't use silicones at all seem to be pretty weak; not strong enough to protect against flat ironing, at least. \n\nIf someone here could tell me if it looks like I'm heading in the right direction, I'd be very grateful.

And even if they do, placing keratin on top of our hair wouldn't necessarily bind it to our hair in a way that sort of bandages any damage, if you are looking for something to offer repair for damaged hair.\n\nFrom [this comment](https://thebeautybrains.com/topic/hydrolized-keratin-vs-cocodimonium-hydroxypropyl-hydrolyzed-keratin/), it seems like Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin might at least stick to the hair, unlike regular hydrolyzed keratin, but still isn't a great conditioning agent.",

I got a balayage highlight recently and added a serum to help manage the change in texture/dryness/frizziness I experienced after the color treatment. \n\nSpecifically, I added a smoothing serum into my normal co-wash routine have reached a point where I could use some feedback. \n\nHere's what I use and the ingredients: \n\n1. Daily co-wash with **Tresemme botanique nourish and replenish conditioner**: Water (Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Behentrimonium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Potassium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone\n2. Daily (for the past week) **Eva NYC Get Glossed! serum**: Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-propyl Silanetriol (Keravis‚Ñ¢), Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Oil, Perfume\n3. Weekly wash (roots only) with **Shea Moisture Moisture Retention Shampoo** (the old formula, transcribed by hand): water, coconut oil, shea butter, aloe vera leaf juice, argan oil, panthenol, rosemary extract, sea kelp extract, vitamin E, guar gum, honeysuckle flower extract, avocado oil\n4. Weekly deep condition with **Hask Monoi Coconut Oil Nourishing Deep Conditioner Packet**: Water / Eau (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Quaternium-18, Gardenia Tahitensis (Monoi) Flower Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oil, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Isopropyl Palmitate, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Silk Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, Fragrance / Parfum (Fragrancia)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy questions are: \n\n1. Can my current co-wash remove the silicones in the serum since they are not accompanied by cationic ingredients (as far as I can tell)? I was using [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) to evaluate the serum and I want to make sure I'm not missing something. \n2. If my co-wash cannot remove the silicones, and I've been using this for the past week, is there a way to remove them without stripping my recent color treatment?\n3. Thoughts on my overall moisture vs. protein balance? I am liking the way my hair looks and feels on this regimen. Should I be concerned adding in a daily serum with protein, on top of protein that is in my weekly deep condition?\n4. Any suggestions for a replacement for the Shea Moisture shampoo since they have reformulated (such a bummer!). This bottle is lasting me since I only wash once a week but I will need to replace this eventually. \n\nThank you in advance for your feedback!",

The swelling/opening of the cuticle that happens in a high pH solution can be damaging and by the time you apply the acidic product it's already done, the acidic rinse is just smoothing things back down and preventing further damage. Also \"pH balanced\" isn't a regulated or clearly defined term so that could be pH 6 or pH 4, so we don't know how effective that conditioner will be at lowering the pH back down. It's much safer to just get a shampoo that's formulated at a safe pH.",

    "body": "I have thick, curly, hair that's very dry and frizzy unless I use lots of leave-in conditioner and oil. I'd say my hair is 2c at its maximum curl potential when I don't use any heat. I'm not interested in maintaining my curly hair because straight hair will be easier to manage when I'm busier. I'm planning on washing it weekly and then going to the hair salon where they'll blow dry it then go over some pieces with a flat iron\n\nI am planning on using lots of protein and silicones to prevent heat damage\n\nThis is how I plan on taking care of my hair:\n\n\\- Shampoo hair with Hask Keratin Protein Smoothing Shampoo. It has a mild sulfate (sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate) to wash out the silicones and I think it has 7 different proteins (keratin amino acids, cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, keratin, hydrolyzed keratin, hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed corn protein, hydrolyzed soy protein) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply Garnier Ultimate Blends Hair Food Banana 3-in-1 and leave it in hair for 15 minutes with heat. It has no protein and is just moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque and leave it in hair for 15 minutes with heat. It has 2 proteins (hydrolized wheat protein, hydrolyzed keratin) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply Hask Keratin Protein Smoothing Conditioner and wash it out after a few minutes. It has 1 silicone (dimethicone) and I think it has 5 different proteins (keratin amino acids, keratin, hydrolyzed keratin, hydrolyzed collagen, cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply Hask Biotin Boost Thickening Conditioner and wash it out after a few minutes. It has 3 silicones (dimethicone, dimethiconol, cyclopentasiloxane) and 1 protein (hydrolyzed collagen) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply a little bit of Chi Silk Infusion Serum on wet hair as a heat protectant. It has 2 silicones (cyclopentasiloxane, dimethiconol) and 4 proteins (hydrolyzed corn protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed silk)\n\n\\- Apply sweet almond oil on ends daily for silky looking hair\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Am I moisturizing my hair enough?\n\nMy hair always feels dry unless I use a leave in conditioner and oil when it's wet. I can't add water to my hair after straightening it because it'll go curly. I'm thinking of switching the Garnier and Shea Moisture conditioners with the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Masque because it has more humectants but it only has 1 protein (hydrolyzed rice protein). What do you think of this switch? Is there a better way to make sure my hair stays moisturized?\n\n2. Am I using too many silicones?\n\nI can only use a little bit of the heat protectant because I used a normal amount last time and the hair stylist at the salon said I had to wash it out and she stripped all of the silicones from my hair, so I want to make sure that I'm using enough silicones other than just the heat protectant. I'm thinking of using 2 conditioners because I prefer the ingredients in the first one but it doesn't have enough silicones. I prefer my hair to be flat when it's straight but I don't want it to look greasy and weighed down, so is using 1 conditioner enough? If so, which conditioner is the better choice? I'll use sweet almond oil on my ends to reduce frizz after straightening my hair because it doesn't have any silicones and tolerates heat well (I'll have to go over my hair with a flat iron for a minute each morning)\n\n3. Am I using enough protein?\n\nIt looks like I listed a lot of protein, but is this truly enough? I'm getting my hair done at the salon where they'll blow dry my hair straight then go over the pieces they couldn't get with a flat iron and I can't control the heat. I can't really use low heat at home either because it takes much longer than it would if I used 200 degrees celcius in my experience\n\nMy goal is to have hair that looks silky and healthy and to retain length. I'm not very interested in retaining my curl pattern because I know it's almost impossible when I'm using this much heat\n\nThank you for reading through this long post and I would greatly appreciate any feedback on my current plan :)",

    "body": "Hi, I (21M) used to have high-density, thick hair and I've never done nothing particularly stressful to them. In 2022 I did perm and done it for a total of three times (Jul 2022, Nov 2022, Jul 2023) until July 2023. During the last perm I noticed my scalp to be much more drier to the point of continuous flaking and itching (everything started when I used a more natural shampoo), so in Oct 2023 I decided to cut my hair short, changed shampoo and started with biotin supplements and give them time to relax e regrowth. This helped a lot since I've never had problem until Jan 2024, when flaking reappeared, as well as the itching, stronger than the previous summer even though the shampoo I was using hadn't caused any problems from Oct to Dec. I didn't went to the dermatologist cause I didn't have much money.\n\nThe situation has stabilized until the flaking reappeared in may-jun of this year, so I finally went to a dermatologist that told me to buy a specific sebum-regulating shampoo. It helped a lot and everything disappeared, the only negative fact is that if this shampoo goes on my back or my shoulders, it causes redness and triggers pimples. Aside from this effect, everything went back to its original balance. \n\nNow that everything is pretty calm, since summer has ended and classes have restarted, I noticed that my hair are way more thin, but not dry or fragile, and fall more easily than what they used to and I don't know why. Is it proven that some ingredients in a shampoo may cause the reduction of hair diameter, considering what it may do to my back and shoulder? Or all shampoos can have this effect it they goes in a different place than the scalp? For the hair loss, maybe it's because it's autumn and it's normal to have more hair in their telogen phase. \n\nFor the history of hair loss in my family: from mother's side, my uncles has all their hair and they're thick and my grandpa only had only receding hairline that accentuated when he was old; from father's side, my dad lost his hair at 30/35, my uncle started when he turned 50 and my grandpa lost a part of them only because he did chemo, but still has dark gray hair. Based on the hair I had, I should hope to not lose them, since I took from my mother.\n\nThank you for your support!!\n\nPS: At the moment I'm not going to the dermatologist because it wasn't a good experience since she check me in less than three minutes and I don't have much money to go to an another private one because last time I paid for the visit myself.\n\n\n\nThese are the components of the shampoo the dermatologist suggested and I'm using: water, sodium myreth sulfate, disodium undecylenamido MEA-sulfosuccinate, sucrose laurate, cocamidopropyl betaine, cocamide DEA, propylene glycol, PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate, Camellia sinensis leaf extract, pyridoxine HCl, panthenol, alcohol, phenoxyethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, sodium PCA, parfum, piroctone olamine, sodium chloride, glycerin, hydroxyacetophenone, sodium benzoate, disodium EDTA, hydrolyzed keratin, benzoic acid, biotin, ammyl cinnamal, linalool.",

So shampoos like Ketoconazole shampoo helps sebum, and fungus, and can help hair thicken. Does your shampoo have Ketoconazole as an active ingredient? You could try this as a replacement shampoo. \n\nThen, you can wait a few months to see if it helps sebum issue and also restores hair. \n\nYou might want to start researching Finasteride and considering you might be experiencing MPB/AA hair loss",

But recently my hair has been breaking immensely during detangling sessions and I‚Äôve just been feeling as though my curls are limp. I also did a porosity test and after swirling the cup the strand fell to the bottom (high porosity I think). I bought olaplex no 3 and the aphogee two step and I already feel much better. \n\nMy question is, to maintain the protein moisture balance, should my daily products have protein too? Everything is protein free and I‚Äôm wondering if outside of using aphogee every month if I should be using more protein elsewhere. My Trader Joe‚Äôs tea tree shampoo has a bit of protein wayyy at the bottom but I doubt that counts. Is there any specific type of protein(silk amino acids, hydrolyzed keratin) that is best to look for?",

I was inspired by [this](https://incidecoder.com/products/ag-conditioning-mist) product, which appears to use both of them. When I did, it formed this snot-like goop that floated on the surface.\n\nI was able to isolate the ingredients to an interaction between the hydrolyzed keratin and the amodimethicone (a combination of water, keratin, and amodimethicone was sufficient to replicate). I thought perhaps it could be pH related, so I (somewhat aimlessly) tried to make a buffer with sodium lactate and lactic acid. That kept the pH a little under 7, but it didn't prevent the reaction.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? I noticed the formulation I linked used citric acid to regulate the pH and different hydrolyzed proteins. It also used an emulsifier (Trideceth-12) which I don't have but appears to be commonly used with ingredients like amodimethicone and cetrimonium chloride for products like this.\n\nUPDATE: Instead of using pure amodimethicone, I bought a version which combined water, amodimethicone, trideceth-12, and cetrimonium chloride. When I combined that with water and hydrolyzed keratin, I did not experience issues with any goopy precipitate. I hypothesize that the inclusion of trideceth-12 helped prevent the precipitate from forming.",

        "body": "It's probably a polymer physics problem. I think the amodimethicone is complexing with the keratin hydrolysate. Keratins are both negatively charged and comparatively rich in hydrophobic amino acids. Once amodimethicone neutralizes the negative charges on the hydrolyzed keratin, I think it leads to decreased solubility and the polymer complex crashed out as a big goopy mess. \n\nThat's kind of how it's supposed to function on the hair itself. It's supposed to complex and crash out to coat the hair. But you're mimicking this action in solution with a high concentration of hair mimic (the keratin hydrolysate). \n\nDepending on how much of each you use, you can probably lower the amount of keratin or just drop it completely. The hydrolyzed keratins aren't going to do much for your hair anyway. Hair isn't alive and can't process the keratin oligomers into useful building blocks anyway. Absorption into the scalp would also be minimal and would probably minimally add to scalp skin hydration. \n\nJust my two cents.",

But the thing I‚Äôm most worried about is once I wash it out and use another conditioner, it‚Äôs like those proteins did nothing but give the illusion of thicker hair. Should I keep using products with protein in them? Or are they not helping?\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "You should probably be getting an allergy test because you can have allergy to anything. Why is it you believe the prior reaction was because of formaldehyde releasers? Fragrance is one of the most common allergies in cosmetics/personal care if I recall correctly. Companies literally have to list out in some places when they've used commonly allergy-causing or sensitizing fragrance components (limolene, linalool, geraniol, etc.). I can tell you I personally react like crazy to plant extracts and fragrances. Honestly, in my opinion, a lot of the fear around formaldehyde releasers is unjustified. There's formaldehyde in apples, pears and in so much stuff that we have zero concern about",

I‚Äôve never had an allergic reaction.\n\nI FINALLY, at 26, have found a hair color that really suits me and I love! I‚Äôve been fake blonde forever but I can‚Äôt keep up with it. My color is definitely copper. \n\nThe hair dye itself, I asked the salon about. They said it‚Äôs very gentle and has never caused an allergic reaction. Despite that, after a few days I got a BAD one and had to go to urgent care. Eyes swollen nearly shut, itching and burning, hives and swelling all over my ears, cheeks and eyes. \n\nNo reaction on my scalp or neck aside from hives on my actual forehead along my hairline. You‚Äôd think a hair product allergy would hurt my scalp and neck too?\n\nI am no stranger to allergic reactions to weird things. Never to hair dye or hair products before, but mystery hives and swelling on my eyes isn‚Äôt abnormal. Always wondered why it‚Äôs always my eyes? \n\nI‚Äôve tried two copper toning conditioners since the original incident (it wasn‚Äôt originally clear that the hair dye had done it) and both escalated things and did the same thing to me! I ended up in urgent care again with my ears, eye lids and cheeks so swollen and messed up. So bad. So much pain. I eventually did spot tests on both arms with these products: NO REACTIONS?! \n\nBased on starting and stopping the conditioners to test things, it‚Äôs 100% the conditioners causing this. When I stop using them it clears. Start again and the hives and swelling trickle right back. They must contain the same ingredient(s) the original dye had that my body can‚Äôt handle. I wear a silk cap with my hair up and out of my face at night, silk pillow cases, detergent is cleared, no new products besides those. It‚Äôs definitely the dye and conditioners. \n\nI was on every allergy med under the sun. Both trips to urgent care and they gave me prednisone. Steroids were the only thing that actually put a dent in this thing. \n\nI‚Äôm at a complete loss here and need some help. I‚Äôve used Copper Overtone and Copper Keracolor. Neither use PPD as an ingredient and also I‚Äôve never had a reaction to hair color before. Had every color in the past. What could be this mystery ingredient that‚Äôs doing this to my eyes and face!? I‚Äôd love to work around this and keep my copper color with some kind of alternative product, but I can‚Äôt figure out what could be causing it. It‚Äôd also be really tough to get this color out of my hair so keeping it is worlds easier than taking it all out and going blonde again. \n\nI‚Äôm allergic to nickel and that‚Äôs it!

That sawmill mills longleaf pine. now, when the winds shift direction it blows in the pollen spores from the milling of the longleaf pine and gives you a reaction.\n\nThe pollen enters your nose, and (most people people have a deviated septum) the pollen gets stuck due to the deviation and possible large turbines in the nose. now the pollen has nowhere to go because it's stuck. It makes its way to the eyes because it a portal of entry. now its inside the sinus cavity, entering the nose and getting into your eyes. One side might always be worse than the other side.\n\nI've done 8 years of research on this. maybe I can point you in a direction or the type of doctor who would know your problem. I was a medical mystery until I did my own scientific  research. ( I have a master degree- MS in climate change and public health, and a BSN.)\n\nYou might not be allergic to the product you are using, but based on where you reside and what pollutants/allergens are present in the air, the chemical reaction between the product you are using and whatever in in the air is creating the mysterious allergy on your forehead/hairline because your skin is sensitive.\n\nDoctors only treat primary issues and not secondary. they also do not take into account things that could be the culprit based on where you live.

Well, now that even he has made it clear, ‚ÄúHydration is the key‚Äù, *even for your manes*. You read that right! Have you ever wondered why you might be struggling with dry hair? Maybe you are missing on keeping your hair hydrated and moist.\n\nLet‚Äôs face it, the pollution, harmful rays and your daily routine might take a toll on your hair‚Äôs health. You might go for a spa, but that‚Äôs not a long term solution, is it? In order to keep your hair healthy, it is important to keep it hydrated & Hydration = water. It plays a massive role in the health of your body to maintain the effective functioning of your skin cells. This includes the impact on the condition of your skin and your scalp.¬†\n\nWhen you don‚Äôt get enough water, your scalp begins to dry up and can flake. This can cause itching and irritation, but more importantly, it can actively damage your skin and make it more vulnerable to conditions like dandruff.\n\nOn the scalp, this damage can start to affect your hair. Healthy hair comes from a healthy, moisturized scalp. On the other hand, hair that grows from a weakened scalp can suffer permanent cuticle damage. Scratching can damage scalp and hair surfaces even further, making them weak.\n\nIt all comes down to what you consume and how good you take care of your hair. Living up to Ronaldo‚Äôs recent fact reminder, ‚Äú*stay hydrated‚Äù,* we have brought to you 5 easy ways to keep your hair hydrated all year long!¬†\n\n## 1. Oiling is a must - Don‚Äôt miss out on that good old champi¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0f0a3cvil771.png?width=286&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aa57229ffea33824660b129a8f8160c40476ba0\n\nThe age-old must-have in your vanity, none other than -¬† hair oil. Hair oil essentially helps in building moisture in your scalp and the lengths of your hair. Coconut oil, argan oil, almond oil and olive oil are the moisturizing agents that can help keep your strands hydrated. You can apply a few drops of oil of your choice to the dry ends of your hair and brush them out gently. Wash it off the next day, and you‚Äôll see a difference within weeks.¬†\n\n## 2. Drink more water and keep yourself hydrated¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cpxun0wil771.png?width=348&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ccabb168f22a50a3f4b5c6a25e6b92b45c5b852\n\nThere‚Äôs no denying that, water is the key to beat dehydration, whether its your body or skin. Drinking plenty of water ensures that your body stays cool from within and hydrated.¬†\n\n## 3. Dry your hair naturally¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o5kjbh5xil771.png?width=374&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b73e1579f7bf0db027da52ce657f3960fc4aac\n\nLimit the usage of heating tools. Period. Your hair is already exposed to a lot of pollutants and heat, so why add more? Excess heat can strip the natural oils of your hair which leads to dryness. Instead, you can let your hair air dry; however, if you have an event or an occasion and you want to style your hair, you can opt for Hot Shot Heat Protection Mist. This will ensure your hair is protected from excess heat.¬†\n\n## 4. A¬† DIY spritzer for your hair¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8x1tobyil771.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=6473ea8a48d46f69a5e07226a304050c65a6fb04\n\nYou can make your own hair spritzer, which is a blend of aloevera and rose water. Spray on clean hair every day for regular hydration. It can even be used on the scalp to promote healthy hair growth to protect your strands from the sun and other pollutants.¬†\n\n## 5. Use hydrating and moisturizing products for your hair¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flm4k6bzil771.jpg?width=478&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d91cb21fa0acb6b487fd4da7b121c745240c7c48\n\nLast but not the least, use hydrating products for your hair. Often not using the right kind of products can also lead to dryness. [BBLUNT‚Äôs Intense Moisture ](http://bblunt.com/products/intense-moisture-trio)range provides ultimate moisture for your dry and rebellious hair. It is packed with the goodness of vitamin E, Jojoba and hydrolyzed keratin. The Intense moisture shampoo, conditioner and hair serum ensures you get moisturized,¬† hydrated and manageable hair in no time.¬†\n\nThere are various factors that dry out your hair. What is important is using the right hydration products to nourish the inner layers of the hair and keep them hydrated. If you have hydrated hair, they automatically turn healthy and luscious.¬†\n\nSo boys and girls, if your hair‚Äôs been dehydrated, it‚Äôs about time to start this regime. Having said that, we have always adored Ronaldo‚Äôs various looks, boys, if you‚Äôre looking for a change, you can check out - [Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs hairstyles that you can try](https://www.bblunt.com/blogs/all/christano-ronaldo-hairstyles-you-need-to-try?_pos=1&_sid=51af97340&_ss=r).¬†",

A frisbee (frizz bee). Well, all of us have been there, haven't we? Hair problems become difficult to deal with, with advancing age.¬†\n\nWith all the pollution, stress, and time-consuming schedules, it's difficult to care for our hair as our mothers and grandmothers did. There's less frequent oiling, more chemical-filled shampoos, and no adequate maintenance.\n\nAll we do is keep applying different oils and changing shampoos, unaware of what the exact problem is. Hair health is important. Hair is a very significant feature of our looks.¬†\n\nSo today, we are reviewing a hair growth supplement[ ](https://healthpyramid.com/folifort)[that can help you get rid of all your hair problems, whether it's age-related or climate-related](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F44c25fi9er8oct98ufxx2napb7.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3DREDD&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2kZag-TkuvxE-_r48nLSB3).¬†\n\nThis product is developed for both men and women and contains essential nutrients that can help them regain superior-quality hair.

For dense and thick hair, the changes are to be made from the inside, that is, the consumption of adequate nutrients or elements that can help with internal growth hormones for hair in the body.¬†\n\nThis product is a mixture of five major nutrients that can give your hair freedom from issues like thinning. It revitalizes your hair like they were in your earlier years. This product is used by several customers, and they even end up getting desired results. One of their reviews is as below:¬†\n\n\"As a woman, I care a lot about my hair's health. But because I'd dyed it one too many times over the years, it had begun to feel frayed and damaged. Whenever I combed, several strands of hair would always fall out. Thank God a friend recommended Folifort to me right when I was starting to panic. In just a few weeks, I saw a noticeable change in my scalp. My hair stopped falling when I combed it. It also looked healthier and shinier for days at a time after a wash. I even bought a few extra bottles for my friends, and they all had the same experience. This is a real gem of a supplement\".¬†\n\nThese kinds of reviews show that people love the product and spreading the word more and more. Folifort is a GMO-free product, and it is manufactured in FDA-registered conditions.¬†\n\n## Is There Any Scientific Evidence For Folifort?¬†\n\nScientists believe that a steroid called DTH is responsible for damaged hair. It comes from testosterone and grows with age. To counter that, Folifort uses its unique blend of nutrients to make sure that the DTH is at regular levels and the hair doesn't get affected.¬†\n\nThe plant, vitamins, and minerals from this product can easily clear off all the toxins from your body, giving your scalp and hair a second chance to grow well.¬†\n\nResveratrol has been shown to inhibit cancerous tumors and slow aging. It also prevents the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).¬†\n\nAtherosclerosis is associated with high blood pressure and diabetes. Both conditions contribute to hair loss. Grape seed extract can lower blood sugar levels and control hypertension.¬†\n\nThe hydrolyzed keratin promotes hair growth by stimulating hair follicles. However, there are other ways that hydrolyzed keratin works. For example, it may help prevent hair loss by preventing the breakdown of collagen fibers. Collagen is an important component of skin and hair. When collagen breaks down, it causes wrinkles and sagging skin.¬†\n\nAnother benefit of using hydrolyzed keratin is that it helps to reduce inflammation. Inflammation is caused by free radicals, which damage cells and tissues. Free radicals cause redness and swelling around the affected area. Using hydrolyzed keratin reduces the number of free radicals in the body.¬†\n\nAlpha lipoic is also used to treat peripheral vascular disease. Peripheral vascular disease refers to damage to the small blood vessels in the arms and legs.¬†\n\nThese small blood vessels carry blood away from the heart and back to the rest of the body. If they become blocked, blood cannot get through them. This results in pain, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet.¬†\n\nAlpha lipoate is also used to treat lactic acidosis.¬†\n\nIn addition to its effect on hair growth, astaxanthin has several benefits, as seen by many research studies. It lowers cholesterol and triglycerides, reduces inflammation, improves digestion, and protects against heart disease.¬†\n\nAll in all,[ ](https://healthpyramid.com/folifort)[Folifort has been used by people of age](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F44c25fi9er8oct98ufxx2napb7.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3DREDD&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2kZag-TkuvxE-_r48nLSB3). It's a supplement that can work for you, giving your hair the required nutrients that are scientifically backed.¬†\n\n## What Are The Benefits of Folifort? What Should You Expect From It?¬†\n\nSplit ends, dry hair, thinning, and dandruff doesn't leave us alone. Different hair products and diet changes might work in the short run, but you need a more effective solution. Folifort can do that for you. Below mentioned are a few benefits that come from Folifort.¬†\n\n## Aids In Preventing Hair Deterioration¬†\n\nNo matter what age you are, Folifort helps to keep your head full of healthy hair, just like you have in your 20s. It helps with reviewing signs of aging in hair.¬†\n\n## Reduces Hair Fall Problems¬†\n\nWith the use of Folifort, your hair follicles will gain strength. No matter how harsh chemicals are on your scalp, it prevents the hair from falling off.¬†\n\n## Makes Hair Thicker¬†\n\nThis product is also filled with ingredients that can help with reducing thinning of hair and makes them look more voluminous.¬†\n\n## Protection From Other Damage¬†\n\nThis product contains elements that can also protect the hair from environmental damage along with damage caused to the scalp by blow-drying.¬†\n\n## Better Blood Circulation¬†\n\nBlood circulation in the head has proven benefits for hair health.[ ](https://healthpyramid.com/folifort)[Certain elements in this product are proven to be the best result in blood circulation, which will, in turn, help the body produce more hair](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F44c25fi9er8oct98ufxx2napb7.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3DREDD&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2kZag-TkuvxE-_r48nLSB3).¬†\n\n## What Are The Ingredients Used In FoliFort That Promote Hair Growth?¬†\n\nHair loss is a rising problem in today's world. However, with supplements like FoliFort in the market, there could still be hope. With that said, let us now look at the ingredients used in FoliFort that make it work:¬†\n\n## Hydrolyzed Keratin¬†\n\nThe hydrolyzed keratin used in this product contains keratins extracted from fish scales. These keratins are highly similar to human hair proteins. In addition, the amino acids present in these keratins are identical to those found in human hair. This means that the hydrolyzed keratin will be able to penetrate the outer layers of the scalp and stimulate hair follicles.¬†\n\nIn addition, the amino acids in the hydrolyzed keratins are responsible for promoting cell division and protein synthesis. This helps to increase the rate at which new cells grow.¬†\n\n## Astaxanthin¬†\n\nAstaxanthin has been shown to stimulate hair follicles and increase hair growth.¬†\n\nIt works by stimulating the production of testosterone in the body. Testosterone is an important hormone that stimulates hair growth.¬†\n\n## Grape Seed Extract¬†\n\nGrape seed extract is rich in antioxidants, including resveratrol. Resveratrol is a powerful antioxidant that can protect your brain and improve blood flow.¬†\n\nIt also increases oxygen delivery to the brain. Oxygen is necessary for healthy hair growth.¬†\n\n## Saw Palmetto¬†\n\nSaw palmetto is another ingredient in FoliFort that promotes hair growth. Saw palmetto is native to North America and grows naturally in the southeastern United States.¬†\n\nSaw palmetto berries contain fatty acids called phytosterols. Phytosterols have been shown to regulate hormones and balance the endocrine system. The endocrine system regulates many functions in the body.¬†\n\nPhytosterols have also been shown to help maintain normal prostate function. Prostate problems are common among men over 50 years old.¬†\n\n## Nettle Root¬†\n\nNettle root is another ingredient that can help promote hair growth. Nettle root is rich in iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, copper, manganese, zinc, selenium, folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and vitamin E.¬†\n\nThese nutrients work together to support hair growth. Iron is needed to produce hemoglobin, which carries oxygen throughout the body.¬†\n\nCalcium supports bone formation and muscle contraction. Magnesium plays a role in nerve function and muscle relaxation.¬†\n\nPotassium is required for a normal heartbeat and fluid balance. Phosphorus is needed for strong bones and teeth.¬†\n\n## White Peony¬†\n\nWhite peony root is made up of various nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. White peony root is known to have anti-inflammatory properties.¬†\n\nIt also helps to regulate thyroid function. The thyroid gland produces hormones that affect many different parts of the body. One of these hormones is T3, which plays a role in regulating hair growth.¬†\n\nT3 is produced when iodine combines with tyrosine. Tyrosine is another amino acid that is needed for normal hair growth.¬†\n\n## Alpha Lipoic Acid¬†\n\nAlpha lipoic acid is a natural compound found in foods like broccoli, spinach, and potatoes. Alpha lipoic acid is used to treat diabetic neuropathy. This condition occurs when nerves become damaged due to poor circulation or metabolic problems.¬†\n\n## Zinc¬†\n\nZinc is an essential mineral that is important for maintaining healthy skin and hair. Zinc deficiency can lead to brittle nails and hair.¬†\n\nWhen you are deficient in zinc, it causes your hair follicles to shrink. As a result, your hair becomes thin and weak.¬†\n\nIt works by stimulating cell division and promoting new cell growth. It is also involved in protein synthesis.¬†\n\nThe best way to ensure adequate zinc intake is to eat foods that contain this nutrient or alternatively use supplements like FoliFort.¬†\n\n## Biotin¬†\n\nBiotin is a vitamin B7 that is essential for converting food into energy. It‚Äôs also required for the formation of fatty acids and steroid hormones.¬†\n\nThe biotin helps to maintain strong nails and hair. It also helps to strengthen bones and muscles.¬†\n\nNow let's check the pricing and guarantee for the product.¬†\n\n## How Much Should I Pay For Folifort?¬†\n\nSpending money on expensive hair revival solutions, like injecting serums, may or may not give the desired results, but Folifort is guaranteed to give you the desired results.¬†\n\nTo begin with, all its products are natural and manufactured to form a product[ ](https://healthpyramid.com/folifort)[that is only available on its official website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F44c25fi9er8oct98ufxx2napb7.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3DREDD&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2kZag-TkuvxE-_r48nLSB3).

The secret often lies in¬†**keratin**¬†‚Äî a natural protein your hair is made of. Over time, exposure to heat, pollution, chemical treatments, and harsh shampoos strips away this essential protein, leaving hair dull, brittle, and frizzy. That‚Äôs where¬†**keratin-infused shampoos**¬†come into play.\n\nIn this blog, we‚Äôll explore¬†**how keratin shampoo works**, why it‚Äôs beneficial, and how it can¬†**transform your hair from damaged to dazzling**.\n\n# What is Keratin?\n\nKeratin is a fibrous structural protein that forms the building blocks of your hair, skin, and nails. In your hair, it forms a protective layer around each strand, giving it strength and elasticity.\n\nBut frequent styling, chemical treatments, and environmental stressors can damage this keratin layer ‚Äî resulting in weak, porous, and breakage-prone hair.\n\n# How Does Keratin Shampoo Strengthen Hair?\n\n**1. Replenishes Lost Protein**  \nKeratin shampoos are formulated with hydrolyzed keratin ‚Äî broken-down proteins small enough to penetrate the hair shaft. These molecules bond with your natural hair protein and¬†**fill in the gaps in the cuticle**, reinforcing the hair‚Äôs internal structure.\n\n**2. Reduces Frizz and Breakage**  \nBy smoothing the cuticle layer, keratin shampoos create a¬†**shield around the hair**, which not only tames frizz but also reduces friction. This leads to less breakage during brushing or styling.\n\n**3. Enhances Moisture Retention**  \nHealthy keratin levels in hair help retain moisture more effectively. A good keratin shampoo keeps the cuticle sealed,¬†**locking in hydration**, and preventing dryness and split ends.\n\n**4. Improves Shine and Manageability**  \nStronger, smoother hair reflects light better ‚Äî giving that glossy, salon-like finish. It also becomes more manageable, making detangling and styling a breeze.\n\n**5. Protects Against Heat Damage**  \nKeratin-infused shampoos often offer a¬†**protective layer that resists heat**, making your hair more resilient against styling tools like blow dryers and straighteners.\n\n# Who Should Use Keratin Shampoo?\n\nKeratin shampoo is ideal for:\n\n* Chemically treated or colored hair\n* Frizzy, dry, or damaged hair\n* Heat-styled hair\n* Curly or wavy textures that need smoothing\n\nHowever, if your hair is fine or naturally oily, look for a¬†**lightweight formula**¬†like Cerise Naturals‚Äô¬†[Keratin Shampoo with Rice Protein and Amla Extract](https://cerisenaturals.com/products/keratin-shampoo)¬†‚Äî which nourishes without weighing down.\n\n",

As a first layer I started to use a simple nail polish from an \"all natural\" organic brand that just contains **shellac** and orange oil, camomile extract and an essential oil. It really smells nice, just like a body oil scented lightly with essential oils would, it absolutely contains none of that typical nail polish smell and this also is the problem - the ingredients are mild, the oil can kind of sink into the nail and nourish it, and the shellac dries, but this coat totally disappears in a day (not sure if the dried shellac even allows the oil to nourish the nail). **Hence I decided to purchase a more typical nail hardener / base coat that I apply over this shellac coat.**\n\n2.) The nail hardener I bought contains pretty standard ingredients any nail hardener / base coat contains here in the EU, so I just chose one that is called X-treme Nail Hardener by S-he stylezone:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Ethyl Acetate | Butyl Acetate | Nitrocellulose | Acetyl Tributyl Citrate | Adipic Acid / Neopentyl Glycol / Trimellitic Anhydride Copolymer | Isopropyl Alcohol | Styrene / Acrylates Copolymer | Silica | Propylene Glycol | Aqua | Etocrylene | Cetyl Palmitate | Cyclomethicone | Hydrolyzed Keratin | Sorbitan Stearate | Dimethicone | Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride | Polysorbate 80 | Tocopheryl Acetate | Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil | Sodium Benzoate | Lecithin | BHT | CI 60725\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However my problem is I can scrape the coat off with my nail?** Like totally. Do all nail polishes dry this semi-soft? I mean I was expecting a tough titanium layer - this is called an X-treme nail hardener after all! - not a layer I can easily scrape off. Do I need a top coat? Do those dry hard? Or do all polishes dry like this? If so, I do not really see a point in applying them to protect my nails from chipping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks! <3",

    "body": " There isn‚Äôt much you can love about fizzy hair. It is neither silky nor sleek. It isn‚Äôt adorable, curvy, sexy or even curly. If you‚Äôve got frizzy hair, there is no doubt that you will fear rain, perspiration or even humidity. This is because they can make such hair become wilder or even fuller. The good part is that there are some solutions to this problem. There are some secret tips on how to make your frizzy hair become smooth and shiny. It will also appear lustrous. The Basics The very first thing that you will need to do is ensure that your hair ‚Äì care regimen is examined thoroughly. There are times when less may be better when you‚Äôve got frizzy hair. This means fewer processes and shampoos. Heat tools should be used less frequently. Fly ‚Äì aways can be reduced through decreased fussing. Avoid activities like scrunching, ironing, blow drying and others since they can increase your chances of having frizzy hair. Below are some tips Trying different stuffs It is important that you discover what is ideal for your hair. This becomes important when your frizzy hair isn‚Äôt improving with the current routine you are undergoing. Are you always showering during morning periods? You may have to try this during night periods. This means your hair will not be damp while you are trying to go out for the day‚Äôs task. After using the shower, you can try to apply more products to such hair than you often do. You can make use of different anti-frizz styling and conditioner products in order to know which particular one your hair is perfectly responding to. Pro Tip Once you‚Äôve applied an anti ‚Äì freezing product, it is important that your hair is wrapped in a towel or T-shirt while you go to bed. You can get it unwrapped during the morning periods to find locks that are smoother. Moisturizing your hair Moisture is what every frizzy hair wants. If your hair isn‚Äôt getting proper hydration from moisturizing products, there is every chance that the air‚Äôs humidity is where it may be getting moisture from. This is an unpleasant source that may cause more harm than good in the long run. The results of this aren‚Äôt what you will love. Also, hair mask should be used weekly. Majority of the hair mask formulae will strengthen, revitalize and nourish your hair. Short ‚Äì term or long ‚Äì term relaxers should be tried out This can help to smoothen your hair. In case you are always making use of your flat ‚Äì iron while washing your hair, it is important you consider the option of hair-relaxing treatment (permanent). You can also make use of short term smoothers which can last up to around 6months. They are versatile smoothers which tend to offer various options. It could be straight, smooth or even sleek hair. The curls have got some lovely shine that anyone will admire. In case you want to make use of any of these treatments, ensure that your hair is in prime condition. This can be achieved through the use of moisturizing, hot oil treatment, and nourishing masks. In order to understand more about these treatments, it is recommended that you discuss with your stylist. Keratin treatment is one of them which is about a protein that contains high amount of amino acid. This is known as cystine. This acid ensures that the hair isn‚Äôt only strong but also elastic. Most people consider keratin treatments to be relaxers but they aren't. Rather, they are a form of hair smoothening treatment through which a combination of hydrolyzed keratin is implanted into the hair cuticle. It is a process which is carried out by a hairdresser that is experienced. The keratin will get clung to your hair cuticle using a flat iron in order to have the hair strands loosened up. The sub-cuticle layer is where this is going to take place. Keratin treatment can be seen as a form of restorative treatment which can get the hair shaft reinforced thereby making it to be much stronger. Through it, uncontrollable hair will be mollified and softened. In a nutshell, it will make your hair not only become frizz - free but also smooth and shiny. Keratin treatments can be applied to various hair textures. It could be various types of ethnic hair, African American hair, curly or frizzy hair. In case your hair is too brittle or dry, it isn‚Äôt advisable to undergo keratin treatment. The same can be said of someone whose hair has been damaged due to excessive bleaching. Depending on your chosen keratin product, they usually last for about 3 ‚Äì 6 months. Your lifestyle as well as home care products are also important factors. These are some of the most vital variables that will determine how long a keratin product will last on your hair when made use of. It can help when the right hydrating products are used What you apply on your hair will always matter. If you would want to get a frizzy hair smoothened, make use of moisturizing conditioner and shampoo. These should be used together with products which have been manufactured for such purpose. Avoid salon grade products since they can complicate your situation. High quality shampoo should be used. Also, over washing should be avoided If any product is beginning to build up in your hair, it is important you make use of a shampoo. You can cut such hair if the build up happens to be pretty bad. If the build up isn‚Äôt an issue, you can make use of a shampoo which contains organic oils or moisturizers. Cleansing conditioner can also do a perfect job. Too much shampooing should be avoided since it can make your hair lose natural oils. These usually fight against frizz hair. Frizz should be lathered up 2 ‚Äì 3 times every week. For those days that may come in ‚Äì between washing days, you are free to make use of baby powder or dry shampoo. This will help to ensure that oil is retained in frizz hair. Conditioner can also be used in place of shampoo while showering. The best conditioner should be selected It is important that you make use of a good conditioner for your hair. This will help to ensure that moisture is put back into such frizzy hair. You will need a condition which contains natural oils, protein and keratin. Natural oils seem more preferable to synthetic due to the fact that they can be easily absorbed by the hair. Conditioners that are protein ‚Äì infused will not only manage frizz but also help in creating shine. On the other hand, synthetic silicon moisturizers will lie on top of your hair thereby making it appear unkempt. Anytime your frizzy hair is being shampooed, rinse ‚Äì out conditioners should be used. After about 2 ‚Äì 5 minutes, they should be washed out. Leave ‚Äì in conditioners should be applied as instructed. It is possible to make use of a nourishing conditioner for touch ‚Äì ups when your hair is frizzy. Ensure that the conditioner is watered down a little bit. After that, use the tip of your hand to get it applied to your hair. Such will make your frizzy lock appear shiny and smoother. Hairstyling products that are frizz taming should be used You have worked very hard to get the smoothness. You will need to ensure that it is maintained with the use of smoothing serum. Apply little on your palm and rub on your hair. Is brushing recommended or not? The fact that hair contains numerous cells and 3 layers shows that it is very complex. The reason why it gets frizzy can‚Äôt be farfetched. The outer layer of your hair can be compared to shingled roof. Anytime your hair seems to be smooth, lots of overlapping layers are lying flat. These layers will be lifted once a brush is run through them. In order to complete this list, below are some tools you can use on your frizzy hair and also other tips which can be of help. Avoid brushing your frizzy hair anytime it is dry Due to the fact that the cuticle of your hair can be disrupted by brushing, it can make it prone to breakage. It can bring about such hair getting stretched. Before brushing, you can use a towel to clean it first. After that, get a little conditioner added. Alternatively, you can make use of an anti ‚Äì frizz product. Make use of wet fingers if you want to get your hair combed. Using wet fingers to finger ‚Äì comb can help prevent de ‚Äì tangling. Also, frizz can be tamed. The ideal brush size should be chosen For those who have long or mid ‚Äì length hair, medium round brushes are the best. If your hair is shorter, a small brush (round) should be used. Large round brushes should be avoided since you may find it very difficult working with them. Just as each section is being dried to smooth, the brush should be turned gently. Hairspray should be used for the finishing. It can also be Spritz. Quality brittles should be chosen If you make use of a flat brush to get your frizzy hair straightened while in the process of blow ‚Äì drying, ensure that you are making use of a boar-bristle brush that is natural. It will help in carrying the natural oil of your scalp to every end. This will get the whole hair shaft moisturized and also reduce any form of oil build ‚Äì up around the scalp. Frizzy hair should be over ‚Äì processed Coloring, straighteners, and relaxers will bring about brittleness and breakage. Salon products are what you should be using. Also, ensure that they have been produced by a professional who understands all the needed formula to tame frizzy hair. Once services like these have been done, ask your stylist to make recommendations about deep conditioning as well as hot treatments. Also, ask about masks which can help in restoring moisture. Hot tools shouldn't be over used If you‚Äôve got a frizzy hair, this is one tip that should always be remembered. The reason is simple as frizzy hair can be damaged by heat. Therefore, you may want to try as much as possible to ensure that the use of flat irons as well as curling irons is avoided. Heat sources should be limited to blow ‚Äì dryer alongside a diffuser at all times. Also, avoid showering in extremely hot water for now. Anything that can get your skin burnt can also do the same to your hair. Ensure that your hair has been prepped with the use of heat ‚Äì protectant spray when heat is being used. If you will be making use of any kind of iron, avoid using it on one particular place or spot for too long. Avoid blow drying all the frizzy hair If a blow dryer will be used for any reason, only get the roots dried out. This will prevent a situation whereby the frizzy ends and hair shaft get dried out. Just like above, heat-protective product should be used prior to getting it dried. This will help in retaining of moisture. Air dry styling creams can also help you get air dry look that is natural.",

    "body": "Hair is a defining feature of our appearance, and maintaining its health and beauty requires the right care. Huk Nanoplastia Hair Treatment is a revolutionary solution designed to restore, nourish, and rejuvenate damaged and frizzy hair. Combining advanced scientific formulations with natural ingredients, this treatment offers long-lasting results, leaving hair smooth, shiny, and manageable.**What is Nanoplastia Hair Treatment?**\n\nNanoplastia is an innovative hair straightening and repair treatment that goes beyond surface-level fixes. Unlike traditional chemical treatments that can strip the hair of natural oils and proteins, Nanoplastia works by infusing the hair with vital nutrients like keratin, amino acids, vitamins, and proteins. The process not only smooths and straightens hair but also strengthens it from the inside out, making it healthier and more resilient over time.\n\nHuk Nanoplastia Hair Treatment, in particular, stands out for its high-quality formulation enriched with **hydrolyzed keratin, argan oil, and essential nutrients**. These ingredients work in harmony to restore damaged hair, seal cuticles, and provide a glossy, frizz-free finish.\n\n# Key Benefits of Huk Nanoplastia Hair Treatment\n\n1. **Deep Hair Repair** Huk Nanoplastia penetrates deep into the hair shaft, repairing damage caused by environmental stressors, heat styling, and chemical treatments. It rebuilds the hair structure, leaving it stronger and more resilient.\n2. **Smooth and Straight Hair** The treatment delivers sleek, straight hair that is easy to manage. Its smoothing properties tame frizz and flyaways, making it ideal for individuals with unruly or curly hair.\n3. **Safe and Chemical-Free** Huk Nanoplastia is free from harsh chemicals like formaldehyde, which are often found in traditional straightening treatments. This makes it a safer option for your hair and scalp.\n4. **Long-Lasting Results** With proper care, the effects of Huk Nanoplastia can last up to 3‚Äì6 months. The treatment seals the nutrients into the hair cuticle, ensuring that the benefits persist even after multiple washes.\n5. **Suitable for All Hair Types** Whether your hair is fine, thick, curly, or straight, Huk Nanoplastia works effectively to enhance its texture and manageability.\n6. **Adds Shine and Hydration** The blend of keratin, argan oil, and amino acids not only repairs but also deeply hydrates the hair. The result is a natural-looking shine and softness.\n\n# How Huk Nanoplastia Works\n\n# Step 1: Preparation\n\nThe treatment begins with a thorough cleansing using a clarifying shampoo to remove impurities, product buildup, and oils from the hair. This step ensures that the hair is ready to absorb the nutrients.\n\n# Step 2: Application\n\nThe Huk Nanoplastia treatment is applied evenly throughout the hair, coating each strand. This formula contains hydrolyzed keratin and other active ingredients that penetrate deep into the hair structure.\n\n# Step 3: Activation\n\nTo activate the treatment, heat is applied using a flat iron. The heat helps seal the nutrients into the hair cuticle while straightening and smoothing the strands.\n\n# Step 4: Rinse and Final Styling\n\nAfter the treatment is set, the hair is rinsed and styled. The end result is silky, straight, and frizz-free hair that looks healthy and vibrant.\n\n# Why Choose Huk Nanoplastia?\n\n1. **Innovative Formulation** Huk Nanoplastia combines science and nature, offering a formula that is both effective and gentle on the hair.\n2. **Trusted Brand** As part of Huk‚Äôs extensive line of hair care products, the Nanoplastia Hair Treatment reflects the brand‚Äôs commitment to quality and innovation.\n3. **Safe for Frequent Use** Since the treatment is free of harmful chemicals, it can be used more frequently than traditional straightening methods without compromising hair health.\n4. **Eco-Friendly Approach** Huk values sustainability, and its products are developed with eco-conscious practices to minimize environmental impact.\n\n# Who Can Benefit from Huk Nanoplastia?\n\n* **Individuals with Frizzy Hair:** For those struggling with frizz and dryness, this treatment offers a sleek, manageable look.\n* **Curly or Wavy Hair Owners:** If you‚Äôre looking to straighten your curls without damaging your hair, Nanoplastia is an ideal choice.\n* **Damaged Hair:** Those with chemically treated or heat-damaged hair will find the restorative properties of Huk Nanoplastia particularly beneficial.\n\n# Post-Treatment Care\n\nTo maintain the results of Huk Nanoplastia, follow these simple tips:\n\n1. **Use Sulfate-Free Shampoo:** Sulfates can strip away the treatment, so opt for gentle, sulfate-free shampoos.\n2. **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Limit the use of products with high alcohol content or strong chemicals.\n3. **Hydrate Regularly:** Use a hydrating mask or conditioner to keep your hair nourished.\n4. **Protect from Heat:** While the treatment minimizes heat damage, it‚Äôs best to use a heat protectant spray when styling with hot tools.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHuk Nanoplastia Hair Treatment is a game-changer for anyone looking to transform their hair. Its advanced formula, enriched with keratin and argan oil, offers a safe, effective, and long-lasting solution for damaged, frizzy, and unmanageable hair. Whether you want to repair, hydrate, or simply enhance your hair‚Äôs natural beauty, Huk Nanoplastia delivers results that speak for themselves.\n\nExperience the magic of Huk Nanoplastia and unlock your hair‚Äôs full potential with smoothness, shine, and health that lasts.

Most products use some kind of polymeric protectant that helps prevent visible damage from heat. Methacrylate copolymers and PVP are pretty common and can help. \n2. The purpose of the alcohol is to help it evaporate quicker. Many of these use agents to build pressure so you can spray the product. It isn't required, but the alcohol is a strange and unnecessary thing to add. Especially if it's at such a low percentage. It's ability to keep things solvated seems small. \n3. Silica, alumina, and titanium dioxide are really strange things to add. They'll act as colorants and dispersants, but they don't serve a function of getting the hair to be protected from heat like that. \n\nWhat you're actually making is a weird lotion that I wouldn't use as a heat protectant at all. This is a seriously difficult thing to formulate as you'll need to test it for efficacy and you might be giving yourself a false sense of security.",

        "body": "This formula does not make sense. I'm gonna break down why so that you can make a heat protectant that makes sense. \n\n\\*It will be crazy expensive to buy all those ingreidents, you're better off with your $7 bottle of CHI. I don't even know if you can get all of them from DIY suppliers. \n\n\\*There's literally nothing in there that needs to be heated to 70C. The alcohol will flash off when heated to 70C, so it won't even be in your formula by the time you're done. Why is it being added before heating? \n\n\\*There are way too many presevratives. 1% phenoxyethanol AND 1% hexylene glycol AND 1% caprylyl glycol? CHI is probably using a blend of those three that TOGEHTER are 1-1.5% of the total formula. I'm not even sure the system can hold that much preservative as none of them are that water soluble. I guess that's what the polysorbate 20 is for? But if so, why isn't the phenoxyethanol included in the P20 premix?\n\n\\*Silica, alumina, and titanium dioxide are all particulates that need to be suspended. There is nothing in this formula that provides suspension. These items will sink to the bottom and likely stick together in a big clump. They have no reason to be here. If they're all on your bottle of CHI, it's probably a highly specific material where one/all of them are being used as substrates for another ingredient. If you source them all individually they will not work the same.\n\n\\*Titanium dioxide is a colorant. That's why it has a CI number--CI numbners are for pigments and colorants like iron oxides, carmine, etc. 3% titanium dioxide will leave your hair looking dusty and white. There are nano grades of titanium dioxide that have better transparency, but those are used as sunscreens and also are not 100% transparent. Sunscreens are not the same as heat protectants, as they screen out two different parts of the light spectrum. \n\n\\*Why is it asking you to adjust the pH of a hair spray to the pH of skin? pH of hair products is typically more acidic than skin products, around 4-5. \n\n\\*I'm assuming the CHI product is fragranced. PPG-20 Methyl Glucose Ether is likely in there as a fragrance fixative. It has other properties, such as being a humectant, but is not necessary for the purpose of a hair protectant when you already have propanediol. It can also reduce the tackniess of a product, but tackiness can be reduced by just using less of the ingredients that cause the tackiness in the first place (like polysorbate 20, other humectants, hydrolyzed silk proteins, etc). \n\n\\*Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is your main heat protecting ingredient. It is the only thing in the formula, other than the humectants, that is actually doing anything for your hair. There is so much filler here it's unreal. \n\n\\*Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is anionic. Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin is cationic. The two will likely react to precipitate out. There goes your heat protection and your fancy keratin (and all the money you spent on both). CHI is probably either using the keratin ingredient at a veryyyy low level (0.01% or less) OR is using a homogenizer to break down the particle size of the precipitate and possibly filtering it out. Or both. \n\n\\*No brand has ever used 1% silk and 2% quaternized keratin in a product and sold it for $7. Those are expensive ingredients. \n\nHere's the outline of a formula that actually makes sense:\n\nWater QS to 100%\n\nSodium polystyrene sulfonate -- not sure about how much of this, you'll need to do some research on appropriate use level for heat protection. \n\nEuxyl PE 9010 1% -- as a phenoxyethanol preservative, or you can use another or  suitable preservative at the appropriate use level.\n\nPropanediol 2-4% -- as a humectant\n\nPotassium sorbate OR caprylyl glycol, either at 0.2% -- as a co-preservative (you only need 1! potassium sorbate is way cheaper and easier to work with.)\n\nHydrolyzed silk blend if you want it, use level completely up to you (CHI probably has it at like 0.5% or less)\n\nAlcohol Denat. 5-10% -- added at the end in order to make the spray dry faster on your hair. It can also be omitted. More alcohol = faster drydown. This part is completely up to your preference. \n\nCitric acid -- QS to adjust pH to 4-5.\n\nThat's it. No silica titanium dioxide or anything, since it's unlikely to work the same in a DIY formula. \n\nInstructions: Sanitize all equipment and work area. Add ingredients to your beaker in the order provided, mixing well between each addition The sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a powder and will take some time to go in, just let it mix for a while. The phenoxyethanol preservative is the same, keep mixing until all it's blobs go in. If it's not going in you can premix it into 0.5-1% polysorbate 20, but try without first. The propanediol should help to solubilize it as well. Don't heat anything, just simple mixing should do the trick.",

Are you tired of seeing pieces of broken hair in your hairbrush and on your pillow in the morning? You may feel like you don‚Äôt have any options, but that‚Äôs not true. A new supplement called Divine Locks is formulated to help support damaged, thin, or slow-growing hair. Hundreds of customers love this supplement. But what is inside this supplement, and how does it work?\n\nPlease keep reading to learn more about Divine Locks Complex, its benefits, pros, cons, and more!\n\n## What Is Divine Locks Complex?\n\nDivine Locks Complex might be right for you if you struggle with poor hair growth, hair fall, thinning, or baldness. By now, you must have searched the internet for miracle cures that are futile to follow.\n\nAlthough miracle cures contain minerals and vitamins, their efficacy is near zero. Unlike those cures,¬†[Divine Locks Complex contains natural and herbal ingredients that tackle your hair issues from the root.](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/3rV8Mka&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3DJvghm7KX5GcevD94Hutc)\n\nInner Beauty & You is the manufacturer of this supplement. According to the maker, Diving Locks helps boost hair rejuvenation and help you grow thicker and healthier hair. The brand has targeted this product to middle-aged and older women who want their heads full of healthy hair.\n\nHowever, women of any age can take this supplement to restore natural hair thickness and youthfulness. Its official website shows Divine Locks Complex features natural and effective ingredients.\n\n## How Does Divine Locks Complex Work?\n\nDivine Locks Complex helps resolve hair issues by targeting the leading cause.\n\nThe immediate impact of Divine Locks is to reverse the signs of aging, allowing your hair cells to proliferate. Moreover, the supplement ensures the availability and absorption of oxygen and nutrients to help your hair. Therefore, the increased absorption of nutritious compounds makes your hair appear healthier.\n\nDivine Locks hair supplement claims that¬†[it can reduce hair loss by up to 80% within just one month](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/3rV8Mka&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3DJvghm7KX5GcevD94Hutc). Moreover, the brand claims that if you use the supplement as recommended, you will start to notice improvements in your hair health within the first week.\n\nDivine Locks‚Äô Ingredients\n\nThe company uses 29 handpicked ingredients. Before using these ingredients in the formulation, the team‚Äôs lab tested each of them to ensure their purity and effectiveness.\n\nHere is the list of ingredients with brief details that you will get in each serving (two tablets) of Divine Locks:\n\n### Astaxanthin\n\n[Astaxanthin¬†](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32202443/)is a carotenoid containing several vitamins. In Divine Locks, this ingredient helps elevate mood levels and improve hair growth, weight gain, and skin pigmentation. Besides, astaxanthin is beneficial for treating hair follicles blocked due to inflammation.\n\n### OptiMSM\n\nOptiMSM is the name of a¬†[sulfur-containing organic compound](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32083522/)¬†that is known for its immunity-boosting effects. Moreover, it supports the development of joints and the growth of healthy skin.\n\nIt features many anti-aging benefits, such as improvement in the development of hair and connective tissues. Besides, the formulators claim that OptiMSM can help you regain youthful energy levels.\n\n### Hydrolyzed Collagen Type 1 & 3 Bovine\n\n[Hydrolyzed collagen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620403/)¬†comes from cows and is a form of protein. Divine Locks has two types of these collagen proteins in active forms 1 and 3. In addition to improving the growth of thicker hair, type 1 collagen helps strengthen nails.\n\n### Olive Water\n\nThe¬†[benefits¬†](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4352757/)and properties of olive water are similar to olive oil. Olive water is known for its potent hair rejuvenation properties, as it increases moisture in the hair cells. However, unlike olive oil, olive water does not capture and seal moisture inside the cells. Therefore, it is better than olive oil.\n\n### L-Methionine\n\n[L-methionine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23020079/)¬†is an amino acid part of many hair products and shampoos. It functions to increase keratin production and reduce the graying of hair. Still, the research is limited on the effectiveness of this amino acid.\n\n### Gotu Kola\n\n[Gotu Kola](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29032741/)¬†is a part of many traditional medicines, including Ayurveda, Indonesian, and Chinese. Not only does this ingredient boost hair growth, but it also lengthens your hair. Therefore, it promotes hair benefits by escalating blood circulation in the scalp.\n\n### Citrus Bioflavonoid\n\nWith its potent antioxidant benefits,¬†[citrus bioflavonoid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7020168/)¬†promotes healthy collagen levels in your scalp. Besides increasing hair growth, the ingredient helps in the protection cells present in the blood vessels of your scalp.\n\n### Wakame, Nori Yaki, Bladderwrack\n\n[Bladderwrack¬†](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3792195/)is an essential ingredient in alternative medicines. It is present in many amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. All these ingredients work synergistically to increase hair growth and improve hair condition. Besides, Wakame and Nori Yaki have similar benefits.\n\n### Hydrolyzed Keratin\n\n[Hydrolyzed keratin¬†](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7820954/)is a large protein that becomes small, more absorbable particles that easily penetrate your hair cuticle after protein cleavage. The formulator has added this to the Divine Locks formula because of its safe and highly effectiveness compared to synthetic chemicals.\n\nIt is beneficial in treating bald spots on the head and prevents hair breakage, frizziness, and fall.\n\n### Hyaluronic Acid\n\nThis is the primary¬†[moisture-retaining ingredient](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19250478/)¬†in the supplement. It boosts hydration in your hair shaft. Thus, when the hair shaft is adequately hydrated, it grows into more substantial, thicker, and healthier hair.\n\n### Amla Fruit\n\n[Amla fruit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6926135/)¬†is a rich source of vitamin C, a superfood for hair. Also known as the Indian gooseberry, it has amino acids, vitamins, phytonutrients, and minerals that help form a healthy scalp.\n\n### Silica Bamboo Stem\n\nThis ingredient benefits the¬†[strength and flexibility of your hair](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5855631/), skin, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Although silica does not directly promote hair growth, it prevents unwanted thinning of your hair.\n\n### Goji Berry\n\n[Goji Berry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343173/)¬†comes from China and is also called wolfberry. These berries have anti-fungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is present in Divine Locks due to its benefits of hair rejuvenation and healthy scalp development.\n\n## Other Ingredients\n\nIn addition to the active and primary ingredients, Divine Locks has other supportive components, which include:\n\n* Biotin\n* Zinc\n* Calcium\n* Selenium\n* Copper\n* Manganese\n* Pantothenic acid\n* Vitamin C, E, and B6\n\n## Benefits of Divine Locks\n\nThe makers of Divine Locks carefully selected herbal and natural ingredients. The manufacturers comply with GMP regulations, so you can be assured that Divine Locks is produced in a facility that follows strict health and safety standards.\n\nAs it is produced in approved facilities, you can expect benefits without side effects.
