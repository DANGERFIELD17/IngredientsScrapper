Plus they’re so packable! Sharpie for scale. https://i.imgur.com/gGkv5Ja.jpg\n\nI do keep my micellar water in an old makeup remover sample bottle from Sephora since it holds a bit more but I used to use a tube for that too and it worked great.\n\nProducts:\n\nMineral oil: I use this to remove waterproof makeup (very rare). Gets the job done with minimal effort and ingredients.\n\nGarnier micellar water, pink cap: I use this on a microfiber cloth instead of washing my face and it’s so much less drying for me than soap.\n\nA-Ret gel 0.025%: been on this about six months. Most of the purging and peeling is over and I’m enjoying the tret glow. Hoping to bump up to 0.04% micro soon.\n\nHada Labo Gokujyun Premium: HG, my skin loves hyaluronic acid and this has 5 kinds. FA-safe and mild. Also great on lips.\n\nAvene tolerance extreme cleansing lotion: this is supposed to be a cold cream that you wipe off but I use it as moisturizer. It has the same exact ingredients as the popular Tolerance Emulsion... but it’s LESS money for 6x the product or something crazy like that! FA-safe, super mild, but adds a nice level of creaminess to my moisturizing routine that I really needed.\n\nAquaphor lip therapy: the ONLY lip balm that healed my cracking, peeling chapped lips. I’m sensitive to lanolin so many popular options were just making it worse. This contains lovely ingredients like glycerin, panthenol, Shea butter and castor oil. I feel like the moisture from this balm actually sinks in.\n\nIn case you’re wondering, I use OGX Bonding Plex shampoo and conditioner (it’s one of very few formulas that doesn’t give me body acne).\n\nHappy trails!",

My conditioner was probably the hardest and it really isn't that hard.\n\nIn the past, I've put foundation, CC cream, even liquid highlighter in these. I've mixed aquaphor with a sliver of lipstick to make my own tinted balms. I usually carry one full of my face sunscreen (Nivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel 50+++) in my purse for on-the-go reapplications; this amount fits 10ish face sized blobs. I'll even do body sunblock if I know I'm going to need 1 or 2 body reapplications in a day (e.g., if I'm going to a baseball game or a long hike or something).\n\nCan you tell I hate carrying excess product? I'm a major minimalist when it comes to packing, whether it's my luggage for a trip or my purse for one day. This method saves space, saves weight, never leaks, squeezes easily, is more hygienic than pots/jars, and is sleek enough to fit into the tiniest of bags. Big fan over here.",

You seduce and beguile me with your promises of retinoids, of copper peptides, of new and enticing vitamin C derivatives. And yet - AND YET - you won't tell me how much of them are included.\n\nI do not demand your entire formulas, no. I am aware that would be revealing too many of your secrets. I don't demand that you break down for me the supporting ingredients, the amount of panthenol and sodium hyaluronate you include so you can tell me that \"soothing, moisturising\" ingredients are included. I ask only this: if you include an ingredient in the name of your product, tell me how much of that ingredient is in the product.\n\nThis goes out to Mad Hippie, who ignored my message inquiring after the % of vitamin A in their Vitamin A Serum. This goes out to Pixi, who told me that the amount of retinol in their Retinol Eye Cream is a trade secret. This goes out to every Vitamin C Toner that may contain anywhere between 2% and 10% of vitamin C; every definitely-not-blue copper peptide serum; every cica spray with Centella asiatica so far down the ingredients list that it may as well just be water.\n\nDon't make me guess. Don't make me pore over the INCI looking for phenoxyethanol to act as a 1% marker, or go digging through strange blogs in case some influencer's publicity pack told them something that you won't tell me. It's not a problem if there isn't much of the star in there! Maybe I don't want very much! Please, just be honest with me.\n\nCosmetics industry, I have spent so much on you. I'm sure we can get past this. Just give me this one little thing. All I need is your honesty. Is that too much to ask?\n\nWith loving exasperation,\n\nTansy\\_Blue\n\nPS - stop telling me that \"1% RetiStar\" is a powerful retinol (actual percent retinol: 0.05%), or that your product is \"3% encapsulated retinoid\" (actual percent retinol: 0.3%). And for goodness sake stop saying that retinyl palmitate is an effective anti-aging agent. What is it about retinol that brings this out in you? Stop misleading me or making me guess how much of this powerful, potentially dangerous compound I am putting on my face.",

However, we can confirm that we used the highest concentration possible of each ingredient to give the best results, without irritating your skin.*\n\nIt honestly came across as so patronizing. I didn't ask about their exact ratios - I asked about the vitamin C percentage which many other companies freely share but theirs is apparently \"top secret\"? As an informed consumer, I am well aware of the highest concentration of vitamin C skin can tolerate before irritation occurs - don't just reassure me with empty words and no real information. \n\nI did not end up purchasing their vitamin C serum.\n\nEDIT: it appears Glossier has changed their ways since I interacted with them last year and they now provide the percentage of the vitamin C on the product page.

I don’t mind that much for my own personal use because I like playing with different skincare products. But, for a client, I want to be able to provide them with proper products, so it just kind of sucks. When brand representatives come in, I usually try to ask about %. Usually they will say they don’t know, and how the brand does not know/will not say how much it is. Or they flat out say they’re not allowed to tell us. When asked why they don’t know or won’t tell us, they say it’s because the brand (usually) believes that the % does not matter. Rather, when in combination with the other ingredients, it will work amazingly. For example: a 5% vitamin C in conjunction with turmeric will work better than a 20% vitamin C. (Just a random example, not saying this is true). So I’m thinking the brands who won’t mention it, USUALLY are pretty low in percentage, or they can’t fully prove the percentage? I don’t know. From a selling perspective, it is a bad choice. Clients always go towards the products with clear percentage. They should consider that.",

The regulatory limit in Europe for this is 1%, that doesnt mean companies are actually using at 1%. If formulated correctly, it may only be needed at <0.5%, also depending on the product type and if you have any other preservatives or boosters present in the formula. So although alot of people use this marker to check if an active is above or below 1%, it could actually be present alot lower than this.\n\nThe company i work for are bringing out Vitamin C and Retinol products and I made it clear that if we bring these out, we need to be able to tell the consumers how much of the active will be present. For Vitamin C it will be on pack (10%) and the Retinol we are actually restricted to 0.1% as per market regulations in certain countries we sell in. It's better to be transparent to customers than to pretend its a 'trade secret' or not letting people know because you're worried what they'll think when they find out its present alot lower than we make it out to be. (If it's that low in the product why bother releasing it in my opinion). With actives tho you'll normally see 'clinically/scientifically proven' claims, so we have to do tests to make sure that the percentage we're using actually works. We cant just stick that claim on there as markets will require proof of testing before registering the product there.\n\nI saw a comment about Retinol, Vitamin C as well as hyaluronic acid derivatives: how can you claim it contains 'Retinol/Vit C/'Hyaluronic Acid' when it actually contains the derivatives that are less potent? I have questioned this and unfortunately there doesnt seem to be an regulatory framework around it, so companies can claim what they like as long as you can provide proof that you are using a 'form' of Retinol/Hyaluronic Acid/Vitamin C, etc in the product.",

I've written a post about Retinol a while ago as well:  [Why retinol percentages can be misleading..](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/fr5275/misc_why_retinol_can_be_misleading/)\n\nSome ingredients that can be helpfull to spot the 1% line: Carbomer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic acid (especially when other thickeners like xanthan gum are present, most often <1%), Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Bisabolol (usually <0.5%), Benzyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Peptides, Ceramides, Retinol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (most formulas I see have <1%), Pentaerythrityl Tetra-DI-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Levulinic Acid, to name a few. Very often you just see the standard blends that they've used as well.\n\nNow look at some PC Antioxidant Serums with these 1% line markers in mind, and as a consumer you basically can't say for sure they contain an effective concentration.   \nMany brands also refer with their percentage to a tradename mixture they've added to a formula, not the single active, so for the Inkey List: 2.5% \"Lipo Hyaluronic Acid solution\", 1% \"RetiStar\", 0.5% \"Granactive Retinoid\", their C-50 treatment, with 5% \"Stay C-50\",  I think that's confusing because consumers don't know the composition of these mixtures. Their moisturizer with vitamin B, C and E, they claim the actives control excess oil, brighten skin, sooth redness, I mean look at the ingredient list, seriously there's barely anything in there. \n\nIts annoying that companies try to get the 1% line very high on the ingredient list, then under 1% list the actives first, and make all kinds of claims about these ingredients, while we have no way of verifying wether they are present at an effective concentration. Just list everything from highest to lowest concentration, that would already be much better. I know it's not mandatory for them to disclose percentages, but well if you buy a sunscreen you also want to know wether its SPF10 or SPF50, and the same applies to skincare in my opinion, you want to have some way of telling wether the ingredients are present in an effective concentration.",

Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

    "body": "Happened upon a guide from a dermatology magazine from ye olde days of circa 2004 which outlined in laymen's terms the core principles of cleansing and moisturizing for different skin types and conditions. These basic key points haven't changed in well over several decades, despite all the gimmicks and new breakthroughs. Thought it'd be an interesting read for both skincare newbies just embarking on their journey and enthusiasts alike. \n\n \n\n# Making the Choice\n\nEvery patient needs to cleanse and moisturize skin properly using suitable cleansers and moisturizers containing the appropriate ingredients. In patients with compromised or sensitive skin, proper cleaning and moisturizing is even more critical. Using too harsh a cleanser or an inappropriate moisturizer can, in many cases, exacerbate certain conditions and can cause contact dermatitis and other problems. \n\nThe plethora of cleansers and moisturizers available today makes it difficult to keep current with new ingredients and their actions — or to guide patients in the selection of these products. In addition, few trials have looked at cleansers and moisturizers and their therapeutic value. \n\n“Dermatologists must understand the ingredients in the products their patients use and what they do to or for the skin. However, the market changes quickly and it is very difficult to keep up,” says Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D., P.A., Clinical Associate Professor, in the Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest University. “They need to keep abreast of this as much as they keep abreast of any aspect of their medical practice by reading journals and going to meetings This aspect of the dermatology practice is just as important as any other since cleansers and moisturizers have a dramatic impact on the skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Moisturizer:**\n\nXerosis occurs when the water content in the skin is less than 10% to 20% — depending on the measurement method, and there is a loss of continuity of the stratum corneum. While moisturizers cannot repair skin, they can help restore the skin barrier and protect the skin as it heals. \n\n“Moisturizers need to stop water loss, decrease itching and burning, and make the skin feel smooth and soft,” says Dr. Draelos. “This creates an optimal environment for healing. Because the skin turns over every two weeks, healing can occur rapidly.” \n\nA good moisturizer should also be hypoallergenic, non-sensitizing, and non-comedogenic. The ingredients in moisturizers are often divided into occlusive agents, humectants, and emollients. \n\nOcclusive agents physically prevent or retard water loss. The most effective occlusive moisturizer is petrolatum. Lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones, such as dimethicone, are also very effective occlusive moisturizers. Applying an occlusive moisturizer immediately after bathing may be an effective way to trap additional water in the skin. \n\nHumectants attract and bind water and can improve the hydration of the stratum corneum. Effective humectants include propylene glycol, glycerin, urea, hyaluronic acid, and pyrrolidone carboxylate (NaPCA). However, high levels of humectants can draw water from surrounding cells and can actually dry the skin further. if not trapped by an occlusive agent. \n\nEmollients soften or soothe the skin by filling spaces between skin flakes and creating a smooth skin surface. They are usually light oily substances, such as octyl octanoate, sesame oil, grape seed oil, or cetyl stearate. Some emollients can also function as occlusive moisturizers. When combined with an emulsifier, the oily emollients are thoroughly mixed with the other water-soluble ingredients in the moisturizer. Emollients are probably the most important consumer ingredient in moisturizers since they provide the smooth skin feel associated with well-moisturized skin. \n\nMoisturizers may contain additional additives such as vitamins E, A, C, niacin, panthenol, peptides, polyphenols, aloe vera, and others. Alpha hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid or glycolic acid, may also be added to decrease cohesion of the excess stratum corneum cells, reducing roughness and scaling. The special ingredients are designed to function as cosmeceuticals imparting unique attributes to standard moisturizer formulations.\n\n Their final efficacy depends on how much of the ingredient is in the moisturizer and how the final formulation interacts with the skin. Despite their benefits, many patients resist using the most effective moisturizers since they often have unappealing characteristics. \n\n“Petrolatum is actually the very best moisturizer available, but it stains clothing, smells bad, and is greasy,” says Dr. Draelos. “Every other moisturizer on the market is trying to achieve the benefits of white petrolatum without the bad aesthetic effects.” \n\nAccording to Dr. Draelos, a good moisturizer should start with an occlusive agent, such as petrolatum or mineral oil, which is not as thick or greasy. It should also include occlusive ingredients that reduce greasiness, such as dimethicone, a type of silicone. \n\n“You might add grape seed, sesame, or some other lightweight oil and emollients, such as cetearyl alcohol,” says Dr. Draelos. “These are oils that can fit between the dry skin cells and make the skin feel smooth and soft.” It is also now possible to synthetically produce ceramides, which are some of the newest occlusive agents to enter the marketplace. \n\nDr. Draelos is excited about some of the newer developments in moisturizers. “The next generation of moisturizers are moisturizers used in a shower. Patients put the moisturizer on in the shower, and then rinse off. This novel technology effectively moisturizes the skin with long-lasting effects and is known as a new category of skincare products known as moisturizes.” *(These are available to us now.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Cleanser:**\n\nExcessive cleaning can damage the skin by washing out the natural humectant agents, change the pH value of the skin, and cause irritant contact dermatitis. \n\n“Cleansing damages the skin because the soap cannot distinguish between unwanted dirt and intercellular lipids,” says Dr. Draelos. “Synthetic detergents known as syndets are not as effective at removing dirt, but they do not remove as many intercellular lipids and are pH adjusted. A good alternative is the newer body washes that remove dirt, but leave behind a thin layer of petrolatum, especially if used with a puff.” \n\nWhen cleansing, all patients should use warm — not hot — water and bathe for not more than 10 minutes. Cleansing agents should be spread sparingly on the wet skin and, after briefly taking effect, completely rinsed off. \n\n“When looking for a cleanser, most patients should avoid cleaners with parabens, fragrances and detergents. Patients should also avoid detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,” says Leslie S. Baumann, M.D., Director of Cosmetic Dermatology at the University of Miami. “Ingredients to look for depend on the skin type, but acne-prone patients should look for cleansers with salicylic acid, while those with rosacea would look for sulfacetamide.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Acne** \n\nSome people with acne may try to stop outbreaks and oil production by scrubbing their skin and using strong detergent soaps and rough scrub pads. However, scrubbing will not improve acne; in fact, it can make the problem worse. Astringents are not recommended unless the skin is very oily, and then they should be used only on oily spots. \n\nPatients with acne should use a mild cleanser (5% benzoyl peroxide wash), once in the morning, once in the evening, and after heavy exercise. Acne suffers generally have oily skin, but the skin barrier can be compromised by treatment, leading to flaking and itching. \n\n“I recommend skin lubricants in the silicone family like cyclomethicone and dimethicone, which soften and hydrate without oils,” explains Mary Lupo, M.D., a dermatologist in private practice in New Orleans and professor of dermatology at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans. “Cleansers should be mild if on treatment, but high surfactant cleansers or those with salicylic acid are good for oily and acne-prone skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Eczema & Other Dermatoses** \n\nAny skin disease will benefit from a moisturizer that strengthens the stratum corneum barrier, even blistering bullous pemphigoid. Moisturizing with a good moisturizer is also very important for a disease such as psoriasis. \n\n“Since this is a disease characterized by hyperkeratosis, keratolytics can play an important role in its treatment. Propylene glycol and lactic acid can be sole, or integral parts, of treatment regimens by effectively removing adherent scales,” says Andrea Trowers, M.D., a pediatric dermatologist who has completed a fellowship in pediatric dermatology at the University of Miami. \n\n“Plastic wrap, plastic gloves or plastic shower caps can be used to occlude the affected area after application of a keratolytic, resulting in increased efficacy.” Patients with eczema usually have an impaired stratum corneum barrier so they can benefit from a moisturizer that will help replace cholesterol, ceramides, and fatty acids. The only skin diseases that generally do not benefit from a moisturizer are conditions that are skin manifestations of internal diseases such as skin cancer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Photoaged Skin** \n\nPhotoaged skin is generally treated with retinoids, which can dry the skin, especially during winter. For these patients, applying a moisturizer is helpful. The best moisturizing agent is petroleum jelly, but it is too greasy for most people, though a creamy version is available that is almost as moisturizing as the original. If other moisturizers are used, they should be the cream versions of the moisturizer. \n\n“Patients with photo-aged skin should avoid detergent cleansers with lots of surfactants. And they should look for added emollients like petrolatum to soothe,” explains Dr. Lupo. “Sodium laurel sulfate and many polysorbates can be very drying. Moisturizers with safflower oils and ceramide complexes are good. Humectants like glycerin are good as well.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ethnic Skin** \n\nPatients with darker skin tones, often referred to as “ethnic skin,” have special concerns. “Ethnic skin is generally no more or less sensitive than lighter skin and all the same precautions apply,” says Heather Woolery-Lloyd, M.D., Director of Ethnic Skin Care for the University of Miami Department of Dermatology. “However, ethnic or darker skin is subject to certain conditions not usually associated with lighter skin, such as hyperpigmentation following irritation.” \n\nIf a cleanser or moisturizer causes an irritation on a fair-skinned person, any redness heals and the skin returns to its normal appearance. However, a darker-skinned individual may be left with dark brown patches on their skin, which is especially bothersome if it occurs on the face. E\n\nExcessive scrubbing and harsh cleansers in patients with conditions such as rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis heighten susceptibility to irritation that can lead to hyperpigmentation. Those patients should use the mildest cleanser and least irritating moisturizers. \n\n“While it is difficult to specifically predict which individuals will be irritated by a particular ingredient, a dermatologist should make sure that patients use products with fewer known irritants,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Soapless cleansers are generally milder than traditional soaps and are especially useful in patients with sensitive skin prone to irritation. Additionally, traditional soaps combine with minerals in hard water and can leave an unwanted residue on skin and hair.” \n\nPatients with pseudofolliculitis barbae may find that cleansers with glycolic acid offer some relief. In addition, shaving gels with salicylic acid can be effective against in-grown hairs. However, these products can be very irritating and should not be used for individuals with sensitive skin. Another issue with darker skin is the ashy appearance of the skin when it becomes dry. While not necessarily a medical issue, it is still of concern to darker-skinned individuals. \n\n“Patients with dry, ashy skin will find products with lactic acid or urea to be effective,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Because they not only moisturize and hydrate the skin, but they also exfoliate the superficial dry scale.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Elderly Skin** \n\nSince elderly patients do not produce a lot of sebum, their skin is dry and prone to itchiness. As a result, the elderly need to be especially careful about skincare. They should wash less frequently and should avoid cleansers as much as possible, relying almost exclusively on warm, not hot, water to rinse away surface dirt. Mild soap, such as glycerin soap, should only be used for local cleaning of, especially soiled areas. The elderly should moisturize frequently, especially after bathing when the skin is still moist. Bath oil can also be used, but patients must be careful about slipping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Young Skin** \n\nMoisturizing is very important in pre-pubescent children since they do not produce a lot of sebum, and they generally get dirtier and require frequent bathing, which dries the skin. “As far as moisturizers, individuals with healthy skin can use most of the products. Just pick a product that leaves skin smooth, not tight or greasy,” says Dr. Lupo. “A combination moisturizer and sunscreen is an excellent choice because you can hydrate the skin and have the added benefit of preventing aging skin and skin cancers.” \n\n“Young children with ethnic skin who have dry skin — especially those living in colder climates — can relieve the dryness and alleviate the ashy appearance by using products like petroleum jelly or even vegetable shortening that has been refrigerated for a cooling effect,” says Dr. Trowers. \n\nOlder children often resist this approach because of the greasy feel, but products such as Cetaphil emollient cream can be almost as effective, with better cosmetic tolerance. According to Dr. Trowers, children of all skin types who suffer from atopic dermatitis often have more bacteria on the surface of the skin. More severe cases can be cleansed below the neck with chlorhexidine, or in milder cases with a product such as Cetaphil anti-bacterial soap, then bathed in a solution of Alpha Keri bath oil. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Understanding the Ingredients:**\n\nConsidering the difference that proper cleansing and moisturizing can make to dermatology patients, it is essential that every dermatologist understand the ingredients that go into moisturizers and cleansers — and the impact that those ingredients have on a patient’s skin. \n\n“Good practice in cleansing and moisturizing can make a significant difference for patients with certain skin conditions and as a therapeutic response to the side effects of medications used for treatment,” says Dr. Baumann. “It is very important for dermatologists and their patients to become familiar with the individual ingredients in moisturizers and cleansers and to know what they really do. Without this knowledge, you may not be able to respond appropriately because your patient has come in with an unfamiliar product, and you are unable to offer sound medical advice.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n*Source: The Dermatologist Volume 12,  Issue 6,  June 2004*",

Turns out it was a disease that caused unbalanced hormones into adulthood. Treating my hormones with medication instantly cleared up the worst of my acne. I wish I could afford to see a dermatologist for my ice pick scars. I unfortunately still break out, but im so relieved the mega painful cysts are gone. The comments from family and friends was the worst part. I wish one single person told me to see a doctor. It was ruining my relationships with people. They saw my acne and not me\n\nAnyways, Your skin looks great!",

I omitted anything prominently featuring an active or with a luxury price tag (over \\~$50). — I also highlighted a few common trigger ingredients for my reactive-skinned kin. Obviously there are loads more ingredients that can trigger breakouts and irritation but I figured these were some of the most common. \n\nTried to be as comprehensive as possible, but this is a massive list so there will probably be some mistakes (and edits).

So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn’t hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible. \n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!), niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae. This is my one non-negotiable skin care item.\n\n[**Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Eczema-Therapy-Moisturizing-Sensitive/dp/B003O7IBZC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-3&keywords=aveeno%2Beczema&th=1) \\- Super moisturizing. **Colloidal oatmeal**, glycerin, panthenol, petrolatum, a ceramide, dimethicone. (People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).) And [Aveeno Eczema Therapy Night Time Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Baby-Nighttime-Colloidal-Dimethicone/dp/B01HI7VY84/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-4&keywords=aveeno+eczema) for something heavier but has same ingredients. You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

I'm gonna switch out those two for something else because I love those creams and would like to have the choice to use it.\n\nThe La Roche Posay cleanser actually washes off clean, unlike the CeraVe Hydrating.\n\n(For people who are worried about parabens and hydroquinone, there is no need, we eat FAR more parabens and hydroquinone than we would ever put on our skin. Hydroquinone is not \"banned\" in other countries. It's just prescription-only because it's a very strong active so governments decided that people will need to use it under a doctor's supervision to avoid abuse.)",

I remember being a child, growing up with eczema and my parents would make me get into that Aveeno bath that I would have the worst reaction to (they didn’t know how allergic I was to it). Urea also gave me a bad reaction when I test patched it. Anyways just a reminder to people to still test patch things! Cerave was probably the most helpful and healing moisturizer for my dry and sensitive skin.",

        "body": "hey this post is a few weeks old but hopefully you can help me a bit; im also a dumbass and i recently fucked up my skin with overexfoliation. i thought my skin was sensitive before, but holy cow, it was nothing compared to how its been the past few days. it feels dry and irritated in a way that it's never felt before (i'm typically oily/acne-prone but it seems very dehydrated now)\n\nat the moment, i can't seem to tolerate any sort of fragrance or alcohols (including fatty alcohols). i had a lot of moisturizing steps in my previous routine, but they all had fragrance of some sort,so today i went to square one and tried to start a new routine. i've tried a few cerave lotions before and they didn't work well for me, so today i picked up cetaphil moisturizer (face + body) but that seems to irritate me a bit too. \n\nSo right now, I'm using a hyaluronic acid serum, aquaphor, and carrier oils that are high in linoleic acid (I happened to have black currant seed and grapeseed oils; they've been sitting in the closet for awhile but they smell and feel fine... and I picked up some \\[toasted\\] pumpkin seed oil, but its made for cooking and i'm not sure if there's a noticeable difference between this and others marketed for skin/hair care...)\n\nOH, and what's been the most soothing has been putting honey (mixed with a carrier oil) on my face. I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I’ve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

I also placed this order as a Korean skin care neophyte with hardly any knowledge about the plethora of essences available so it's been a great yet pricey introduction. Therefore the odds of reordering are less than zero because although I do enjoy it it's incredibly overpriced. I could find a comparable essence and get an extra 50ml for between $15-20 so because it's cost prohibitive I can't see myself ordering again. The high cost for only 100ml is why I'm knocking off two stars, I'm all for making a profit but what's most appealing about K-beauty is how it's much more affordable than other skin care, & this pricing is everything I'm trying to avoid. If this essence was more reasonably priced I'd absolutely continue to buy.\n\n(EDIT: Just stating based on some good dialogue below that I absolutely don't begrudge anyone who wouldn't mind dropping stacks on this average-to-me essence, especially if it works for you & you don't mind neither the cost or IMO the less than transparent way they post their ratings - company practices just matter to me... I'd be all over Drunk Elephant but since I heard about their publicly God-awful customer non-service on IG ain't no way in hell they're getting my $$$ doesn't matter to me that their uber-pricey line is excellently reviewed -\n\nIf it were revolutionary or the only game in town or worth it to me of course I might think differently, in this case where I didn't know of other K-beauty lines I'm just about value & comparables given my own limited budget, so even though I liked it it's just not that special to me so it's not worth the $$$. Thank God for YesStyle, StyleKorean & Jolse or else I'd have no affordable way to get great K-beauty.

    "body": "I used to post on GOMI analyzing the ingredients of different Glossier formulations and would generally comment on their product releases, but I thought I'd move to reddit for this one since I think it's more helpful here.\n\nMe: I work in the beauty industry on the product development side and because of that I'm constantly testing new products from competitors either just to keep up with the industry or when clients bring them in as comparisons. Recently I came across a product that I thought omg, I need to post this on reddit bc there are a ton of people who would probably want to know this.\n\nThis post will cover the first [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) dupe which is a 99.999% match, is half the price (or usually less) - and the sole difference is that it has a different fragrance.\n\nIf you look up “Glossier Milky Jelly Dupes” the one that is always coming up is the Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser. That one is annoying because is not a real dupe at all; it’s just vaguely texturally similar and has a similar bottle, but the formulation has nearly nothing in common with Milky Jelly in any way. Kind of pointless.\n\nPresenting the last word in Milky Jelly dupes, the [ELF Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9). It is \\*nearly identical in every way\\* to Milky Jelly and is usually on sale for $3. Srsly.\n\nIngredients comparison:\n\nE.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser Ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 184, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, Isohexadecane, Xylitylglucoside, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Vb5), Hydroxyacetophenone, Isopropyl Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Xylitol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThese formulations are nearly identical. They have the same cleansing agents in almost exactly the same order, and even the same textural ingredients. E.L.F. was definitely duplicating the formula exactly when they were formulating.\n\nAs I've said, I've tested the E.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser and the Milky Jelly face wash and they are nearly identical. The texture is bang-on and the use experience is the same. There is just one real difference - the Glossier cleanser uses rosewater as the scent ingredient, and the Bounce Back uses a coconut fragrance. I’m sensitive to fragrances and it doesn’t bother me at all, it’s pretty light.\n\nThe best part? The E.L.F. Bounce Back Milky Jelly dupe is $6.00 for 100ml.\n\n$6.\n\nAnd when I ordered it for testing, it was actually $3 because E.L.F. always has sales.\n\nTo compare, Glossier Milky Jelly is $18.00 for 177ml + shipping.\n\nWhere to buy the Bounce Back: it’s is a little annoying, since they don’t have it in Target, or on Amazon it seems, but you can get it on the ELF website. Here’s the link:\n\n[https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9)\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I don't work for ELF, and never have, and think most of their products are very mediocre. But this one is clearly a copy of something already tested and popular (and I don't feel bad about sharing it because the Glossier Milky Jelly was a total rip-off/copy of the LaRoche Posay Physiological Gel, soooo)",

    "body": "**15 Sunscreens for Sensitive Skin at Low Price Point (with Photos + Research!) - PART TWO**\n\nI'm back for ROUND TWO of sunscreens, with slightly different requirements and a better understanding of sunscreen formulation and effectiveness. I dove back into my research, bought 15 solid candidates, took too many photos of my face, and wrote 12,000 words about my experiences. \n\nFair warning: this is a long read. Reddit has a character limit for posts (40,000) so I split this post into five sections. The first half is here in this post, while the rest is in comments below. **When you reach the end of the post, keep scrolling!** Please also upvote the comments with the rest of the reviews so they stay at the top of the section and folks can find them more easily.\n\nI have desert-dry, sensitive skin. I suffer from seasonal eczema and allergic contact dermatitis. After a round of formal dermatological patch testing in early 2020, I know that I'm allergic to sandalwood and lanolin, and reactive to fragrance and essential oils. I've been on retinoids (Differin, then Adapalene 0.3%, now Tretinoin Micro 0.04%) since March 2018.\n\nMy selection criteria:\n\n* Low price point (I aimed for under 40 cents per ml, but I'm bad at math and made mistakes)\n* Safe for sensitive skin (must be free of fragrance and essential oils, alcohol free preferred)\n* At least SPF 50 with good UVA protection\n\nI don't want a sunscreen that I need to be precious with or careful to keep out of my eye area. I want something cosmetically elegant that I can glob on everywhere and have it just work. I don't mind some initial white cast if it fades completely. Preference for sunscreens that perform well when reapplied or worn under makeup (minimal to no pilling) but I work from home and don't go out that often, so I'm flexible on this.\n\n[Group Photo of the Whole Squad Together!](https://imgur.com/a/EmlSfAC)\n\nI have 9 chemical/organic sunscreens, 2 combination sunscreens, and 4 physical/mineral sunscreens. 4 of them are potential contenders to take over Purito Centella Green Level Unscented SPF's place on your vanity. \n\nI tried to take photos of each sunscreen on multiple days and in different lighting (indoor, outdoor, bathroom, office, etc.) to give you the clearest picture of how it looks. I also triple-checked that my phone didn't have any auto-filters turned on. I know this is fairly common with smartphones these days. I have a Google Pixel 3a.\n\n(1) SVR Cicavit+ Soothing Repairing Protective Anti-Mark Care SPF 50+\n\n(2) Bioderma Cicabio Soothing Repairing Cream SPF 50+ PPD 31\n\n(3) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n(4) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Perfect Sun Block SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n(5) La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 SPF 50 Soothing Repairing Balm\n\n(6) OMI - Verdio UV Moisture Gel SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n(7) OMI - Verdio UV Moisture Essence SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n(8) Bioderma Photoderm Max Milk SPF 50+ PPD 42\n\n(9) Avène Solar Cream / Very High Protection Cream Skin SPF 50+ Without Perfume\n\n(10) Uriage Bariésun Ultra-Light Fluid SPF 50+\n\n(11) Black Girl Sunscreen (BGS) Kids SPF 50\n\n(12) Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen SPF 50+\n\n(13) Coppertone Pure & Simple Baby SPF 50\n\n(14) Avène Sun Care SPF 50+ Mineral Milk\n\n(15) Pipette Baby Mineral Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, I treated each sunscreen exactly the same: I measured out a half teaspoon, applied on every inch of my face (up to my hairline, down my neck and décolletage, around the back of my neck, on my ears, lips, and eyelids), then reapplied a little extra to the high points of my face.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#BEST AND WORST\n\n**Game of Centella Clones Winner**: Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel\n\n**Best Chemical/Organic Sunscreen**: SVR Cicavit+\n\n**Best Physical/Mineral Sunscreen**: Pipette Baby Mineral Sunscreen\n\n**Best Everyday Sunscreen**: Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with SPF\n\n**Best Outdoor Exercise Sunscreen**: Uriage Bariésun Ultra-Light Fluid\n\n**Best Makeup Primer Sunscreen**: OMI Verdio UV Moisture Essence\n\n**Best Value**: Coppertone Pure & Simple Baby\n\n**Worst for Sensitive Skin**: Black Girl Sunscreen (BGS) Kids\n\n**Worst Value**: Bioderma Cicabio\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#Missed Connections\n\nThese are sunscreens I wanted to try, but couldn't get due to stock issues, inaccessibility in my country, price increases, or I found out about them too late.

According to the brand website, this sunscreen is supposed to be \"repairing\" and \"especially formulated for the protection of damaged skin, in order to prevent the darkening process\" in the recovery phase after dermatological procedures. The brand website claims that it \"guarantees summer skin without marks,\" that it has \"invisible texture,\" and that it \"repairs skin 7x faster\" compared to untreated skin. That implies a high level of both UVA and UVB protection, and the combination of filters backs up that claim. I have seen several mentions on Reddit that this product has a PPD value of 40+ but I wasn't able to find a good source to corroborate this.\n\nUvasorb HEB (Iscotrizinol) is a nearly perfect UVB filter. It requires relatively low concentrations to achieve high SPF values and it is one of the most photostable chemical sunscreens, with 25 hours required to lose 10% of its SPF protection ability. In contrast, other \"photostable\" filters reach that point in just two hours. Uvasorb HEB is also present in the Avène Solar Cream sunscreen, as well as many other Avène products.\n\nThe antioxidant and soothing ingredients include polysaccharide (prebiotic sugar), carrot root extract, niacinamide, and caffeyl glucoside (antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and photoprotective effects).\n\n**Impressions**: After falling in and out of love with the Purito Green Level SPF, I started my search with EU sunscreens that also contain centella/cica, the star ingredient in the Purito product. Due to inadequate prior research, I assumed that any product with \"cica\" in the name contained centella asiatica (madecassoside). That assumption proved correct for the Bioderma Cicabio product (below), but not for the SVR one! The SVR Cicavit product line actually does not contain centella.\n\nThis sunscreen is a very close match to the Purito in terms of texture, tolerability, and performance – despite the missing key ingredient. It's a thicker, colorless cream and a little more difficult to spread, which is reassuring because it means it creates a more robust barrier on my skin. It absorbs into my skin but leaves a light protective barrier, which I quite like. There is zero white cast, it masks redness the way the Purito does, and it never caused an eczema flare-up after wearing it every day for a week. It's easy to apply a lot of this stuff (even more than the recommended amount) without becoming greasy or cakey. It's more nourishing than the Purito, and my skin never felt dry or tight even after 12 hours of wear and multiple reapplications. \n\nThe true test came when I wore this to the salon to get my hair cut in January (the first time since Covid began). Even after sitting under one of those hot hair dryer dome things for 15 minutes, my skin didn't get red or itchy the way it usually does (hot air is a trigger for me). In that case, the SVR Cicavit+ is protective, something I really need in the wintertime! It also worked great with makeup, as long as I didn't wait too long to apply my foundation. \n\nThe only downside is that it tends to pill up after wearing for a few hours, so I need to be really careful not to touch my face at all or it'll start to ball up and fall off. It's better to reapply by patting it in, rather than rubbing. It's also significantly smaller than the Purito bottle, but at the same price point. I wish this came in a larger bottle. Despite these negatives, this is a winner for me! Even after trying all of the other sunscreens, this is the one that I reach for the most often. I've already repurchased another bottle and plan to continue using it long-term. I especially love the next-generation filters and (possibly) super-high UVA protection.\n\nIf you're not sure which SVR sunscreen is right for you, check out [this review post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroSkincare/comments/l10rtd/svr_sunscreens_review_spf_50/) by /u/_Tiny_Penguin_ that discusses three SVR sunscreens, including the Cicavit+ one. They have combination skin that doesn't vibe with the richness of this sunscreen, so they prefer SVR Sun Secure Invisible Fluid Dry Touch. According to [this review](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/loouvz/review_a_review_of_5_different_european_sunscreens/) by /u/jeong_life, SVR Sensifine Air Creme is less heavy/greasy than the SVR Cicavit+ so that might also be a good option for combo or oily skin. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/svr-cicavit-creme-spf-50-soothing-repairing-protective-anti-mark-care)\n\n**Price**: $16.04 for 40 ml ($0.40 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/i0GZLjN)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(2) Bioderma Cicabio Soothing Repairing Cream SPF50+ PPD 31**\n\n**Filters**: Uvinul A Plus, Homosalate, Octinoxate, Octisalate, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S \n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: The ingredients list is fabulous – hyaluronic acid, glycerin, centella asiatica, madecassoside, oh my! It also contains Antalgicine (a proprietary ingredient) that's supposed to \"regulate skin reactivity\" and \"relieve discomfort and the urge to scratch.\" \n\nCentella asiatica (also known as brahmi, Asiatic pennywort, tiger grass, and gotu kola) is one of my favorite skincare ingredients. Centella has potent antioxidant properties, is a rich source of amino acids, can help repair the moisture barrier, and may mitigate some of the visible effects of sun damage. It increases synthesis of collagen, improves tensile strength of newly formed skin, and inhibits the inflammatory phase of hypertrophic scars and keloids. (Source: [Advances in Dermatology and Allergology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3834700/) and [Paula's Choice](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/ingredient-spotlight/centella-asiatica-for-skin.html)) \n\nThe marketing for the Bioderma Cicabio cream says that it's \"ideal for use after dermatological procedures, and in instances of irritation, redness and overheating.\" This aligns with research on centella asiatica, so it seems like a reasonable claim.\n\n**Impressions**: This is the first contender for the champion sunscreen that will take Purito's centella-scented throne. Should we call it... Game of Centella Clones? (That was a poorly executed pun, forgive me.)\n\nI put this review immediately after the SVR Cicavit+ review so you'd still have it in your mind when you read about Bioderma's version of a centella sunscreen. The short answer is that this stuff is inferior to the SVR product, although I can't really tell you why that is. It's easy to apply, feels nice on my skin, and has no whitecast. The product itself is clearly green in color, but it goes on clear right away with zero effort. The combination of filters is really nice, so it offers great UVA/UVB protection. It also gives long-lasting moisture from the HA and glycerin.\n\nThe problem is that it irritated the heck out of my dry skin. It resurrected eczema patches on my face that I thought were totally healed. You can see a couple of these spots in the photos, bright red and angry on my cheek and temple. After an hour of wear, my eyes started to burn, so I had to wash it off. It's similar to my experience with another Bioderma product in this list, the Photoderm Max Milk. Why, Bioderma? Why do your sunscreens suck for me? This stuff *should* have been great, and it's probably perfectly fine for everyone but me. If you've used Bioderma products in the past and had a good experience, you will most likely like this.\n\nThis sunscreen is the worst value of all the products I tried. 30 ml is only enough sunscreen for 12 days if you use 1/2 tsp each day. That means you'll spend more than $32 for one month of sunscreen. It is a good size to keep in my bag to use as hand cream when I'm out and about, which is how I'm using this up. It's a pretty bomb hand cream, but not worth the price. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/bioderma-cicabio-cream-spf50-30ml)\n\n**Price**: $17.81 for 30 ml ($0.59 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/EuLRE2S)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(3) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Filters**: Octisalate, Homosalate, Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Uvinul A Plus, Parsol SLX \n\n**(4) Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Perfect Sun Block SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Filters**: Titanium Dioxide\n\nHere are the second and third contenders in the Game of Centella Clones. This is a joint review! Like the Verdio sunscreens (below), I couldn't really tell which one of these hyaluronic acid centella sunscreens would be best for me, so I decided to get both. One of them is a chemical sunscreen (watery sun gel) and the other is a physical sunscreen (perfect sun block). The formulas are similar enough that it makes more sense for me to discuss them together in a compare/contrast style, rather than repeating myself in two separate reviews. \n\nI want to be clear on pricing – retail price for both of these products is $20–$26 USD, which is above my price limit. However, during Jolse's Chinese New Year sale in February, they were 50% off and I was able to grab both for $26 combined. Jolse and Yesstyle have sales all the time, so I believe this more affordable price will be accessible, given some patience. Once you've tried it, it's a good idea to stock up on 5+ bottles at a time when the price is right. \n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Both sunscreens are packed with soothing and hydrating ingredients: EIGHT variants of hyaluronic acid (small, medium, and large molecule size), centella asiatica, niacinamide, ceramides, lactobacillus ferment lysate filtrate (probiotic with soothing and anti-redness properties), pycnogenol (antioxidant derived from pine bark), and purslane extract (succulent plant with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, rich in omega-3 fatty acids). \n\nAccording to [this article by Lab Muffin](https://labmuffin.com/what-is-hyaluronic-acid-and-how-does-it-work/), \"smaller molecules are able to penetrate the skin better than larger molecules, which means that low molecular weight hyaluronic acid can hydrate deeper than high molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which holds onto water at the surface of the skin.\"\n\nThe brand product pages say that the products passed a skin irritation test with a score of 0.0, which makes them hypoallergenic, according to the COREDERM Skin Research Center. The product pages do not elaborate on the testing process, so we have to take that at face value.\n\nThe perfect sun block is marketed for sensitive skin for soothing and brightening purposes, while the watery sun gel is marketed for dry skin for moisturizing and softening purposes. I feel like the Venn diagram of dry skin versus sensitive skin in this context is basically a circle. In theory, the chemical filters in the sun gel might potentially be irritating to very sensitive folks, who might have an easier time with physical blockers.\n\nI like the next-generation filters in the sun gel. It includes a \"hybrid\" filter (Tinosorb M) that's halfway between a physical blocker and a chemical agent. It works in partnership with the other next-gen filter (Tinosorb S) to provide excellent UVA/UVB spectrum coverage. It also has Parsol SLX (Polysilicone-15), which is a new one for me; I don't think I've tried a sunscreen with this filter yet. Launched in 2008, it's a silicone-based UVB absorber. This sun gel also contains Uvinul A Plus, an awesome UVA blocker. I'm super impressed by the sheer number of filters packed into this sunscreen! It seems to me like it provides layers of redundant protection for both UVA and UVB with both old-school US filters and next-generation EU filters. I wish we knew more about the percentages used.\n\nAs for the perfect sun block, it has only one filter (Titanium). While Titanium doesn’t provide as much protection from long-wave UVA rays as Zinc, it is still effective at blocking short-wave UVA and UVB. [Read more about this here](https://www.colorescience.com/blogs/learn/zinc-oxide-titanium-dioxide). There is one other Titanium-only sunscreen in this list (Avène Mineral Milk) for comparison. I don't want to spoil that review, but I will say that Titanium is known for causing pretty bad white cast. As far as I'm concerned, both Isntree products are likely to provide good broad-spectrum protection, so it comes down to how they perform in real life and which one is more cosmetically elegant.\n\n**Impressions**: The **watery sun gel** was my most-anticipated purchase. It has everything I like and nothing I can't tolerate, with a bunch of nifty next-generation filters. It's a thin, opaque gel that goes on clear right away. The name \"watery gel\" is perfectly accurate because it feels just like water on my skin, with a slight cooling effect as it dries and absorbs. I was a little wary about the amount of protection in such a cosmetically elegant sunscreen, so I went ahead and applied two layers to start. It never felt thick or cakey; it didn't feel any different from applying a single layer even when I put on five fingers' worth of product. It has a satin (leaning matte) finish after it dries down, which takes less than five minutes. Other reviews have called the finish dewy, but this wasn't my experience. If you tried Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence and loved the way it feels but didn't like the high ethanol content, you should definitely pick this up. \n\nI had an active, itchy eczema patch on my right cheek on the first day I tested this. I was about two weeks into this flare-up and didn't want to wait any longer to test out my fancy new sunscreens. I was interested to see whether this would irritate the area, make it more red, or cause bumpiness. Was this a stupid risk? Yes. If you have active eczema, you probably shouldn't be trying out new skincare products. It's like playing a game of chicken with the devil. The results: it didn't make my patch of eczema any worse, and it didn't cause it to burn or itch. It was inoffensive, which is one of the best things I can say about a sunscreen.\n\nI encourage you to also read [this review of the hyaluronic sun gel](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/ltv9ro/isntree_hyaluronic_acid_watery_sun_gel_spf50_pa/) by /u/uv-ux from a few months ago. Their impressions are quite similar to mine. James Welsh also reviewed this product in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO9wBNImFqc&ab_channel=JamesWelsh). He says, \"it's everything I expect from a Korean sunscreen\" and \"Isntree is a brand that never disappoints me.\"\n\nLater, once my eczema patch was more healed, I tried the **perfect sun block**. As expected, this one was a light cream in texture. It goes on chalk white and it takes a little while for the white cast to fade. It felt a little tacky for a while before it dried down completely, which took roughly 10 minutes. At first I thought that the cast did fade completely (I couldn't see it IRL) but you can clearly see it in the photos. I didn't apply this around the back of my neck so I could compare the sunscreen areas with bare skin. There's definitely a faint white cast, even after 20-30 minutes of waiting. I also saw some remaining chalkiness around my hairline. It rubbed off white streaks on my clothes; this is most visible on the day I wore a black t-shirt. \n\nI've tried far worse mineral sunscreens so I'm not mad about this. It's perfectly fine for days when I hang out at home by myself with the doggos. However, if you're going to buy a mineral sunscreen, I would recommend choosing one with Zinc rather than Titanium, or a very small amount of Titanium. It seems like white cast is more or less unavoidable with Titanium. \n\nI recommend watching [this review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTinWpVrZo&t=481s&ab_channel=MySkincareRegime) of all three Isntree hyaluronic acid sunscreens (there's also a stick one). You can see side-by-side comparisons of product applications and finishes. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder for GEL](https://incidecoder.com/products/isntree-hyaluronic-acid-watery-sun-gel) and [INCI Decoder for BLOCK](https://incidecoder.com/products/isntree-hyaluronic-acid-perfect-sun-block)\n\n**Price**: $16.71 for 60 ml ($0.27 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Isntree Watery Sun Gel](https://imgur.com/a/XHTFwY9) and [Isntree Perfect Sun Block](https://imgur.com/a/ThgSGGO)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(5) La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 SPF50 Soothing Repairing Balm**\n\n**Filters**: Homosalate, Octisalate, Avobenzone, Octocrylene, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T 150, Ensulizole, Mexoryl XL \n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Essential Oil Free, Contains Alcohol Denat. (7th ingredient)\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Everyone on /r/tretinoin loves the LRP Cicaplast Baume B5. It has obtained HG status as a gold-star occlusive just like Aquaphor, Cerave healing ointment, and good old fashioned Vaseline. The sunscreen version is described as a \"dual action formula\" ideal for \"all kinds of everyday skin irritations and minor everyday injuries caused by daily aggressions.\" (What is an \"aggression\" in this context? Walking to the mailbox without SPF? Looking out the window on a sunny day?) There is no explanation provided for what \"dual action\" means, although my hunch is they're referring to sunscreen + moisture but trying to make it sound high-tech. It has EIGHT sunscreen filters, which frankly might be overkill even for me. I have to assume the percentages used are super low, right?\n\nAccording to the product description, this is a \"lightweight formula [that] absorbs fast, avoiding any sticky, greasy residue.\" Based on the ingredients list, I believe this counts as an occlusive, as well as a moisturizer and sunscreen. A true multitasking extraordinaire, it might be a \"one and done\" product for your AM routine. It has one of LRP's favorite ingredients, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), as well as madecassoside, glycerin, zinc, and thermal spring water.  \n\nLa Roche Posay is part of L'Oréal Group, which means some of its profit goes to Nestlé.\n\n**Impressions**: This is the fourth contender for the Game of Centella Clones throne. Like many others here, I quite like the original Cicaplast Baume and used it liberally until I found an alternative that works better for me – Aveeno Baby Nighttime Eczema Balm, which I get in a giant tub. Oatmeal > centella in my book, although I like both ingredients a lot.\n\nDo the wealth of moisturizing and soothing ingredients make up for the alcohol in this product? I'm sensitive to alcohol in my skincare and usually flush red when exposed to it. Like all the other sunscreens on this list, I patch tested this on the inside of my wrist for three days. I expected it to smell like a perfume sample but I didn't catch even the faintest whiff of alcohol. That was a very promising start! \n\nIn terms of texture, it's virtually identical to the original Cicaplast Baume. The cream is opaque white but rubs in clear. I think it's strange that the directions say to \"avoid lips and eye contour areas\" because this is supposedly a product for your face, so why would you do that? I went ahead and applied it all over my face anyway because I'm a loose cannon cop who doesn't play by the rules. It also says it's suitable for adults and children, but not babies. Is the alcohol the problem?\n\nAs it turns out, the alcohol was indeed the problem, but not the only one. This stuff refused to blend on my lips, leaving an unattractive dry white glaze. What's more, it was also incredibly difficult to blend this into my face because it dried down way too quickly. By the time I finished rubbing it into my forehead, it had already dried on my cheeks. Any attempt to touch those areas again caused major pilling. I'm talking a matter of under 30 seconds from squeezing the cream on my fingers to having it bone-dry on my face. You can see that in the photos–pilling all over my cheeks and redness everywhere else. Usability is seriously an issue here, especially for dry skin. The marketing is actually accurate in that regard – it does absorb super fast and it does not leave a sticky or greasy residue. The problem is that the process happens so quickly that it's too difficult to get a smooth, even layer of product before it's too late and you're stuck with the sunscreen equivalent of dandruff.\n\nFor a product that's supposed to be soothing and hydrating, it also fails hard in that regard. My skin felt seriously irritated. I felt red bumpy patches on my cheeks in the first half hour; these started to itch not soon after. Later that evening, my cheeks erupted with heat and redness, almost exactly like if I had drunk a glass of red wine while eating Thai curry. (If you know, you know.) If you have rosacea or eczema, this is not your friend.\n\nThere aren't any long-form or video reviews out there for the SPF 50 version, but the short reviews I could find on third-party sites were fairly consistent. Several people complained of the white cast and of feeling greasy. I didn't personally feel greasy even a little bit, even applying a substantial amount of it on my face. YMMV on this one.\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/la-roche-posay-cicaplast-baume-b5-spf50)\n\n**Price**: $9.85 for 40 ml ($0.24 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/LHMacxY)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(6) OMI - Verdio UV Moisture Gel SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Filters**: Titanium Dioxide, Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul T 150, Tinosorb S \n\n**(7) OMI - Verdio UV Moisture Essence SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Filters**: Octinoxate, Octocrylene, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S \n\nThis will be another joint review, covering both products and their differences.\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Dye Free, Paraben Free, Waterproof\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Verdio doesn't have an English-language website, so I relied on product descriptions on third-party seller sites. According to the product marketing, both the gel and the essence are waterproof and sweatproof, and protect against \"environmental stressors, pollen, and particulate matter (PM) pollution.\" Both products have several plant-derived antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, including green tea, Chinese skullcap root, moringa, and pearl barley. The gel has more ingredients, but largely the composition is the same. Based on the filters, it looks like the gel might offer better protection, but at the potential cost of white cast from the titanium. \n\nI'd like to say a few things about Octocrylene. This is a super-popular sunscreen filter that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. It's included in five sunscreens in this review. According to recent research, this organic compound can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer, which results in an increased production of free radicals. (Source: [Free Radical Biology & Medicine](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9f14s2dd)) Another study found that Octocrylene degrades into a toxic chemical that is a known carcinogen and endocrine disruptor (benzophenone). (Source: [Chemical Research in Toxicology](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00461)) You can read a more in-depth discussion on this topic in [this blog post](http://cyrillelaurent.com/2019/06/09/sunscreen-in-your-blood/) by Cyrille Laurent. Cyrille comes to the conclusion that the fear-mongering around Octocrylene is overblown and that the ingredient has not been proven unsafe. I think it's worth it to be cautious, but I wouldn't dismiss Octocrylene altogether because it's hard to avoid, especially for U.S. consumers.\n\n**Impressions**: I tried the **essence** first. It smells like green tea! I drink green tea with ginger every morning and I love the scent. This product does not contain synthetic fragrance, so one can assume that there's a good amount of actual green tea in the product formulation. It's a light green gel-cream that goes on clear instantly with no rubbing required. Like most Japanese sunscreens, it's incredibly cosmetically elegant. I could put on multiple layers with zero fuss. It feels moisturizing and soothing, much more so than the LRP Cicaplast product and comparable to Purito centella sun. It does not do anything to mitigate redness. It's one of the most comfortable sunscreens I tried, in that I didn't mind wearing it all day and slapping more on every couple hours. It didn't dry out my skin or irritate it as I wore it, which is a big plus for me. Also, no pilling!\n\nI think this is a pretty good dupe for the Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV, but without the tacky skin feel and without the glittery-shimmery effect. It's an excellent base for makeup and didn't move around or separate when I applied concealer and foundation on top. I tested it by using it as a primer for a full face of makeup on a warm, foggy day with 100% humidity and 5+ UV Index. My base stayed put and didn't separate while drinking outdoors at a brewery in the hottest part of the day and taking my mask on/off multiple times. \n\nOverall, the Verdio UV Moisture Essence is an excellent, cost-effective option for sensitive skin if you don't mind the light green tea scent and need something that performs well under makeup.\n\nThen, I tried the **gel** another day. I was looking for white cast, as Titanium tends to be problematic. I can't be sure how much of this filter is included in the formulation, so it could feasibly have very little. My first impression was that the name is a misnomer; this isn't a gel at all. It's actually more like a runny milk in texture, much like Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk (also a combination sunscreen). It has no discernable scent, unlike the essence. It goes on clear right away, which allowed me to apply multiple thin layers right off the bat. No white cast!\n\nIt was lightly moisturizing, did not irritate active eczema, and left a glossy film on my skin. Over the first hour, my skin did become less shiny but did not become all the way matte. However, at the same time, it started to ball up on the baby hairs on my neck and around my hairline. I don't think it was visible to other people but I could feel the little clumps of product and it bothered me. This is probably not the best for people with facial hair. The best part about this product is that it's CHEAP and comes in a larger bottle than the standard Japanese sunscreen. \n\nHead to head, I would recommend the essence over the gel as it's more cosmetically elegant and it wears better over time. However, both are very good options if you have sensitive skin.\n\nIn [this video by Raw Tin Skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jysf3rwP1s4&ab_channel=RawTinSkin), he compares both of the products in a side-by-side, head-to-head review. He also had a tough time discerning the difference between them, so the video includes a full ingredient breakdown. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder for GEL](https://incidecoder.com/products/omi-verdio-uv-moisture-gel-spf-50-pa] and [INCI Decoder for ESSENCE](https://incidecoder.com/products/omi-verdio-uv-moisture-essence-spf-50-pa)\n\n**Price**: GEL is $13.90 for 80 ml ($0.17 per ml) and ESSENCE is $10.90 for 50 ml ($0.21 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Verdio Essence](https://imgur.com/a/wEECoQK) and [Verdio Gel](https://imgur.com/a/qwp1Nsu)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(8) Bioderma Photoderm Max Milk SPF 50+ PPD 42**\n\n**Filters**: Octocrylene, Tinosorb M, Avobenzone, Tinosorb S\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Paraben Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Bioderma's Photoderm Max line is top-shelf in terms of UVA protection. It offers spectacular broad-spectrum protection by (jargon incoming) \"erecting a double barrier to encourage its immunity against the sun: the best of external protection as well as unique, patented and laboratory-tested Cellular Bioprotection.\" I'm assuming that the \"double barrier\" in this sense is the base of chemical filters (Octocrylene, Avobenzone), followed by a second layer of next-generation hybrid filters (Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S). Octocrylene and Tinosorb S are present to stabilize the Avobenzone, which is unreliable on its own. The brand also boasts about a \"patented prebiotic complex\" but I wasn't able to determine what exactly that is. \n\n**Impressions**: I really, really wanted to like this stuff. I bought it last summer before going on a beach trip because I wanted the highest-possible UVA protection. In that regard, it's awesome, with a fantastic PPD rating and excellent combination of filters. (I believe the P20 Kids sunscreen actually has a higher PPD rating with 50+.) \n\nAnd now for the bad: It's impossible to make this stuff work for me. It refuses to blend on my skin, so it looks like I have grey-white patches all over. It also burns the living hell out of my eyes, to the point where I cry when I apply it. Even worse, it doesn't set after 20-30 minutes, so every time something brushed my face it came back streaked with white. In the photos, it looks okay in natural light with cloud cover (which mutes and softens the light) but horrible in direct light from my bathroom vanity or sunlight through a window. \n\nThe only way I could use this is to apply it as a second layer, above a thinner and more cosmetically elegant sunscreen (Purito, before I knew it was inadequate). I used this as a topper, patting it carefully on the highest points of my face and my shoulders before going out into the sun. In that regard, it was fine. I might not have applied enough to make a difference, but I felt more protected. I think this is the end of the road for my relationship with Bioderma sunscreens. They just don't vibe with me. \n\nBefore discounting this product entirely, you should read [this review by Lab Muffin](https://labmuffin.com/sunscreen-review-2-bioderma-la-roche-posay/), which compares it to La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Cream (EU).

        "body": "#MORE REVIEWS -- Part Six\n\n#Head-to-Head Comparison - Mineral Sunscreens\n\nI have Aveeno Positively Mineral SPF 50 and Australian Gold Botanical SPF 50 Mineral Lotion (untinted) in my bathroom. I don't like either of these products because the white cast they produce is egregious and they have zero cosmetic elegance. I decided to put those on my arms, alongside the Pipette, Avène, and Coppertone representatives.\n\n[Here are swatches of all five mineral sunscreens.](https://imgur.com/a/mBWKGAL) I tried my best to use equal amounts of each product, although they varied in texture/thickness. The first photo shows the blobs right out of the bottles. The second photo shows them blended out so you can see how much area each one covers. The third photo shows them blended in all the way (by tapping with two fingers) after a 10 minute wait for them to dry down completely.\n\n**Pipette was the most invisible, closely followed by Coppertone.** They would be tied, but I know Coppertone had a visible cast on my face so I have to factor that in. The Coppertone one looked much better on my arm versus my face; I didn't see the grey tone at all and it looked just like regular skin. Maybe it doesn't vibe with one of my AM skincare products and performs better on bare skin. I like what I see and I'm going to use it up as a body sunscreen in the summer. \n\n**Avène and Aveeno were tied for the worst white cast.** The Aveeno also clung to the hairs on my arms (zoom in and you'll see it) so my skin looked bumpy, like chicken flesh. I think it's interesting that three of these (Aveeno, Pipette, and Coppertone) all contain 20%+ zinc, but performed very differently in terms of white cast. The Australian Gold had a slight cast but it wasn't anything terrible, perhaps because it's a titanium/zinc mix. I'm a little iffy about the protection with just 4% of each filter.\n\n**Pipette felt the most moisturizing and Aveeno felt the most drying**, with the other three somewhere in the middle. The Avène sunscreen provided a good amount of moisture but it never dried down, even after an hour of wear while I did some chores around the house. It continued to smear around and transfer onto my clothes. I think the Aveeno formulation is all-around terrible but it did dry down relatively quickly and didn't create a mess. I would rank the Australian Gold higher because of its less-awful white cast. If you can tolerate eucalyptus oil and have a good shade match in the tinted sunscreen line, you should just buy that instead. \n\nOverall rankings:\n\n1. Pipette Baby Mineral\n2. Coppertone Pure & Simple Baby\n3. Australian Gold Botanical Untinted\n4. Aveeno Positively Mineral\n5. Avène Mineral Milk\n\nAfter I did this whole experiment, I realized that I forgot about the Instree Perfect Sun Block, which is a titanium-only sunscreen. (Sucks to suck.) I don't want to do this again but if anyone really wants to see how it compares, ask me and I'll put something together.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n#FAQ\n\nBased on the PMs I received on the previous mega review post, I want to proactively address some common queries. Feel free to reply to this comment with follow-up questions.\n\n**What's your skincare routine?**\n\nAM\n\n* Vanicream gentle cleanser\n* Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid (chin and nose)\n* The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid + B5\n* Aveeno Calm + Restore Triple Oat Serum\n* Vanicream Lite Lotion\n* Sunscreeeeeeen\n\nPM\n\n* Garnier micellar water pink cap (first cleanse, when I need it)\n* Vanicream gentle cleanser\n* TO Hyaluronic Acid\n* Vanicream in the tub\n* Tretinoin Micro 0.04%\n* Eucrisa (Rx ointment for eczema) – sometimes I use this in the morning too\n* Aveeno Baby Nighttime Eczema Balm\n* Vaseline\n\n**What does your fantasy sunscreen look like? What special ingredients does it have?**\n\n[My all-time favorite skincare ingredient is oatmeal.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/bf0nor/experiencing_irritation_consider_oatmeal/) My ideal sunscreen is a vegan, hydrating, water-based cream that contains avena sativa/colloidal oatmeal, hyaluronic acid, and a centella/cica derivative. It has a short-ish ingredients list, uses straightforward marketing language, and is safe for babies. It has at least three next-generation filters and does not include Titanium. If I'm truly shooting for the stars here, I'd like the PPD rating to be 40+ (but I'll settle for 20+). If the SVR Cicavit+ sunscreen contained oatmeal and centella, that would be game over for me.\n\nAveeno Protect + Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion SPF 70 and Innisfree Oat Mild Moisture Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA+++ are the closest matches on the market today, but both products have their flaws. First Aid Beauty also has some nice sunscreens with oatmeal, but nothing higher than SPF 30 and they're quite pricey for what you get. If Krave makes an SPF 50+ version of their oatmeal gel-cream, I'll buy it no matter what they charge for it. Oat So Simple sucks as a moisturizer but it would make for a stellar sunscreen.\n\n**What complexion/base makeup do you use? Are they also fragrance/alcohol/EO free?**\n\nYes, I like to put on a face of makeup for special occasions, which were few and far between in 2020 due to COVID. It's difficult to find fragrance free and essential oil free foundations. Citrus oils seem to be jammed into everything these days. I currently use The Ordinary serum foundation or coverage foundation, depending on what I need that day. Both retail for $7. I use shade 1.2P. I'm interested in trying ILIA foundations but they're so expensive...\n\nPreviously, before my dermatological patch testing, I was using MAC Face + Body (N1), Dr Jart Premium Beauty Balm (gold bottle, forgot the shade), or It Cosmetics CC+ Cream in Fair Light. All of these contain citrus essential oils so I threw them out after receiving my patch test results.\n\nFor concealer, I use Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer in Vanilla. It's the first concealer I ever tried (thank you, helpful Ulta employee in 2014) and I saw no reason to try anything else until this January, when The Ordinary launched their concealer. I'm trying that one out now. It's fine, but more difficult to blend and the shade match isn't quite right. It's only $6 versus Nars at $30 so I'm determined to make it work. \n\nFor primer, Hylamide Photography Foundation in transparent. I also like Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter. The mini size is only $15 and it should last me a whole year.",

        "body": "#MORE REVIEWS -- Part Five\n\n**(14) Avène Sun Care SPF 50+ Mineral Milk**\n\n**Filters**: Titanium Dioxide (Nano) \n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Waterproof\n\n**Marketing Claims**: The product description says the sunscreen uses a \"light, cream-to-powder formula enriched with a powerful photostable antioxidant.\" I believe the antioxidant in question is Tinogard TT, which is known for preventing oxidation. The brand page also says that this is \"VERY water-resistant\" so this could be a good option for swimming, beach trips, and other sweaty activities.\n\nThere's some controversy around the safety of nano particles and whether they are absorbed into the bloodstream. [This literature review study from 2017](https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens) offers up-to-date evidence on this topic. In the abstract, it says \"systemic absorption, hence toxicity, is highly unlikely... on current evidence, neither TiO2 nor ZnO NPs are likely to cause harm when used as ingredients in sunscreens and when sunscreens are used as directed.\" \n\n**Impressions**: I'm not going to bury the lede – do not buy this. This is a \"deceptive\" sunscreen. When I first squeezed it out, I noticed a peachy tint to the mostly white cream. I thought that was a promising sign of minimal white cast. I read reviews on Amazon and LovelySkin that praised the way it blends into their skin, so I was pretty sure this would be a BB cream situation, or maybe something similar to the Australian Gold tinted mineral sunscreen. \n\nI could have not been more wrong. I'm going to ask you to scroll down and click on the photos I took before reading further; a picture is worth a thousand words, and boy I have a lot to say. The white cast is absurdly bad. [This is an accurate depiction of what I looked like.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/62/6b/48/626b48060c919023cf32552768fa5075.jpg)\n\nI swear that I used the correct amount of product, equal to every other mineral sunscreen. In fact, I may have used a bit less, as I didn't apply any extra to the tops of my cheekbones or around the back of my neck. It's chalk white, does not blend in, does not absorb, and does not dry down with time. Further efforts to rub it into my skin only succeeded in rubbing it OFF onto my hands, which defeats the purpose of wearing sunscreen. It got all over the collar of my sweater (my husband's sweater, actually, thank you honey) in just a few minutes. Where was the \"cream to powder\" texture? I just saw cream. \n\nI tolerated it on my face for an hour before washing it off. That was also a strenuous process. It's very, very waterproof, so my usual approach of Vanicream cleanser + water did nothing. I went in with liberal amounts of micellar water and managed to remove most of it, then followed with even more cleanser. Oil cleansing is probably best. If you want a product that doesn't budge when you go scuba diving, this is the one for you.\n\nWho is this sunscreen meant for? Who is the target consumer? At least with the Coppertone and Pipette mineral sunscreens, we can say that they're meant for babies who don't care about white cast or cosmetic elegance. Avène markets this stuff to adults!\n\nBack to the reviews I read before my purchase – one verified customer said that \"You barely need more than a drop,\" a second person said \"a very small amount goes a long way,\" and another said they like to \"add a bit of glow with liquid bronzer.\" Someone on Amazon said in their review that \"I just put enough to cover all the areas of my face/neck.\" The obvious conclusion here is that these satisfied customers were using a tiny amount, far less than they should. We know for a fact that [SPF changes with how much sunscreen you use](https://labmuffin.com/spf-changes-how-much-sunscreen-use/). Applying half the recommended amount of SPF 50 sunscreen cannot give you more than SPF 10. \n\nSimilarly, mixing sunscreen with other products (even other sunscreens) can disrupt the formula, destabilize the filters, and impact the amount of protection you get. Dermablend recently came under fire for instructing consumers to mix their Flawless Creator Drops into sunscreen, and has since purged all mentions of this feature from their marketing (some remnants are still on Instagram). Hyram even demonstrated this technique in a video a while ago, so I don't think this is a widely-known fact. If you didn't know... now you do!\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/avene-mineral-cream-spf-50)\n\n**Price**: $13.73 for 100ml ($0.13 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/k6OIril)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**(15) Pipette Baby Mineral Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50**\n\n**Filters**:  Non-nano Zinc Oxide (20%) (Mineral Sunscreen)\n\n**Key Facts**: Vegan, Cruelty Free, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Reef Safe\n\n**Marketing Claims**: I saw this sunscreen start popping up on Instagram last year. It's enjoyed a considerable amount of hype in the past few months. This all-zinc sunscreen is described as having no white cast! In addition, it contains a healthy amount of bisabolol (an active component of chamomile), squalane, and glycerin for moisturizing and soothing purposes. Pipette is a brand for babies and mothers and this is clearly marketed as safe for small children.\n\n**Impressions**: Loyal, persistent readers, I saved the best for last. (Thank you for reading this far, I love you.) As soon as I unwrapped the sunscreen, I popped it open and squirted some on the back of my hand. As I rubbed it in, I literally said \"what the fuck\" out loud as it disappeared. Within 10 seconds, it was invisible. The first time I applied it to my face (several days later, after my patch testing) I was slightly disappointed to find that there was actually a bit of white cast, especially around my hairline. You can see that in the last set of photos (bright blue shirt). \n\nThen, I discovered the solution that makes this stuff truly invisible: it reacts with HEAT. According to a prescient Black lady who left a review on Amazon, you need to let it warm up a little in your hands before applying it to your face. She was 100% correct – when I tried this method, I saw zero white cast every day. You can rub your fingers together to generate heat or just wait for a few moments for your body heat to do the job. It makes a big difference in ease of application, as it turns clear in half the time. \n\nThis sunscreen quickly became my daily driver through the coldest part of winter, when the air was dry and my skin was even drier. It soothes my eczema patches, keeps my skin moisturized, and doesn't cause a single bit of irritation. If you have normal to oily skin, you may describe this stuff as \"greasy,\" but that wasn't my experience. Unlike the BGS Kids sunscreen, the greasiness quickly went away, leaving a neutral finish that looks and feels like bare skin. I don't know what kind of witchcraft they're doing over at Pipette but I am a HUGE FAN. It's also an incredible value, because you get 3 oz for under $20 and it's available in several retail stores in the U.S. What's not to love?\n\nAccording to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/lnepqq/misc_compared_the_biossance_pipette_mineral/) comparing the Biossance Squalane + Zinc SPF 30 and Pipette mineral SPF 50 sunscreens, the two products have a significant amount of overlap in their ingredients lists. The two brands actually have the same parent company – Amyris. That means that they could potentially use the same base formula. They share a squalane focus in their product compositions and have similar marketing, using \"clean\" and \"nontoxic\" type buzzwords. Now for the million-dollar question: Is this a dupe for either of the Biossance sunscreens? I have no idea; I've never tried Biossance sunscreens because they're too pricey. /u/Sunscreen-Queen shared her thoughts on the Biossance sunscreens in [her mega-review post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/lcu9os/review_25_facial_sunscreen_reviews_biossance/). She ranked it the \"best everyday sunscreen\" and answered several questions about it in the comments section.\n\n[Dr. Dray made a video reviewing the Pipette sunscreen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPrMA1UJAtM&ab_channel=DrDray) She experienced a \"barely noticeable\" white cast on her pale skin. Other than that, she was complimentary and mostly had good things to say about Pipette products. I didn't personally see a cast on her skin in the video, but I know cameras can be deceiving. \n\nDr. Alexis Stephens also reviewed the Pipette sunscreen in her [Best Sunscreens for Darker Skin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prNn0rMT2cE&ab_channel=DrAlexisStephens). She called it a \"total dupe for the Biossance sunscreen.\" In the video, she does a split-screen test of both products so you can see how they perform side-by-side. She experienced no white cast after letting it absorb for 10 minutes. \n\nI also want to share [this review by @brownskinderm on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKHAx1ZhRpO/), which offers another POC perspective. She ranks the product texture and white cast a \"C,\" but gives extra credit for its moisturizing and antioxidant ingredients. Pipette earned a \"C+\" grade for adults, and \"A\" grade for babies. Overall, there are mixed reviews for Pipette on darker skin tones, so YMMV.\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/pipette-mineral-sunscreen-broad-spectrum-spf-50)\n\n**Price**: $16.50 for 120 ml ($0.13 per ml), you can get a 30 ml travel/sample bottle for $7\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/yju85c5)\n\n#More reviews in comment below.

        "body": "#MORE REVIEWS -- Part Two\n\n**(9) Avène Solar Cream / Very High Protection Cream Skin SPF50 + Without Perfume**\n\n**Filters**: Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Avobenzone\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: This is also known as \"Solaire Cream\" depending on the website. The product description says this is \"ideal for sun-sensitive and hypersensitive skins, light and milky skins (blond, red-hair skin).\" I'm assuming this is their way of saying they made this for Fitzpatrick Types I and II. (It me!) With Tinosorb M and Tinosorb S (UVA/UVB filters), Avobenzone (UVA), and Uvasorb HEB (UVB), this product offers stellar broad-spectrum protection.\n\n**Impressions**: The directions say to apply SIX PUMPS to your face and neck – many people would assume that one pump = one dose, so it's great that the instructions are so clear. I used exactly that much. It's very thick cream and difficult to spread, but I made it work by dotting little blobs all over my face and working them in from there. Upon first application, it caused a purple-white cast, noticeable but not nearly as bad as Avène mineral milk (spoiler). In the time it took me to finish applying, put on my shoes, find a tennis ball for the dog, and walk outside, the white cast had already faded. That was a very good start! \n\nIt's not really that moisturizing, so you couldn't use this as the only moisturizer in your AM routine. It lacks our friends glycerin, hyaluronic acid, squalane, etc. In terms of appearance, you can see by the selfies that it looks just like bare skin. It left a barely noticeable film on top of my skin, which I believe is a sign that it formed a good, solid barrier. \n\nTwo hours after the initial application, the white cast returned like a Bond villain attacking the hero for the final confrontation. It appeared as white, flaky dandruff-like flecks on the driest parts of my face (lower cheeks). I don't shave my face so there's some fine blond hair in that general area. I didn't rest my face in my hands or rub my face at all, so these white flecks appeared out of nowhere. It seems like it was exacerbating my existing dry spots, despite my super-moisturizing AM routine. It's a bummer because I was really enjoying this stuff before I looked in the mirror and saw how dry I was. \n\nThere is a similar product available in this product line, the Avène Solar Fluid, which is better for oily and combination skin. It's formulated to be mattifying with a non-shiny effect. If you don't have particularly dry skin and want something to mitigate oilness, you should give the fluid a try rather than the cream. In the distance, you hear a ghost wailing, *If you've tried it... give us a revieeewwwwww...*\n\n[Several reviews on MakeupAlley](https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=118618/Very-High-Protection-Cream-SPF-50+/Avene/Sunscreen) corroborate my experience. Reviewers who described their skin as \"dry\" complained that the sunscreen clings to flakes, sticky feeling, and goopy texture. One person said it left them \"as pink as Peppa Pig.\"\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/avene-avene-suncare-cream-spf-50)\n\n**Price**: CREAM is $12.79 for 50 ml ($0.25 per ml) and FLUID is $15.72 for 50 ml ($0.31 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/E3a30xc)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**(10) Uriage Bariésun Ultra-Light Fluid SPF50+**\n\n**Filters**: Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Avobenzone, Octisalate, Tinosorb S\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Water Resistant\n\n**Marketing Claims**: This sunscreen boasts a \"latest-generation filter complex\" that provides comprehensive UVA/UVB protection. It contains vitamins C and E. Looking at the ingredients list, this one actually is the **shortest** (24 ingredients), which means it's straightforward but also that it lacks unique or fun ingredients like centella, hyaluronic acid, and apologies from your high school boyfriend for how he treated you. Fewer ingredients usually translates to safer for sensitive skin. \n\nThe product page says that \"95% people who tested the product observed an invisible finish after application and 86% observed a non-oily finish\" (according to a usage test with 20 people, but it doesn't say if any of them were POC).\n\n**Impressions**: The texture and feel of the sunscreen is nearly identical to our beloved Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk. It comes out as a runny liquid and is most easily applied directly to your face, rather than to your fingers first. For all that this is an all-chemical sunscreen, it certainly performs like a combination one that has titanium oxide. Tinosorb S is the likely culprit. It's easy to rub in, but leaves a noticeable whitecast for the first minute before drying down clear. I actually quite like this because it's easy to see where I've already applied the stuff, and to tell which areas need a bit more. The bottle must be shaken before you squeeze any out (it separates easily) but it lacks the satisfying clickity-clackity sound the blue (previously gold) Skin Aqua super moisture milk bottle makes. \n\nMy first impression was lovely – it felt nice and moisturizing, and wasn't too shiny or greasy. However, after wearing it for a few hours I started to feel drier and slightly tight. My skin became matte. This is a negative for me but a potential positive for my combo and oily readers. The second time I wore this sunscreen, I accidentally squirted it directly in my eyeball and it hurt like a bitch. So, don't do that, I guess. Also, there was absolutely no pilling at all, even when I rubbed my fingers vigorously on my jawline. That's a plus for makeup-wearers! I think I could come to love using this, if only the price were better. It'll be a good product for traveling. \n\nThe bottle is SO SMALL that it's actually quite pricey when you calculate the price by volume. (Same size as the Bioderma Cicabio, for those keeping score at home.) Look at it next to the U.S. sunscreens in my group photo – it looks like a deluxe sample, not a whole-ass product! I would forgive this if brands offered a \"jumbo\" size, even better if it comes with a discount in price per ml. Who do we have to lobby in order to make that an industry standard?\n\nI also ordered a bottle of Uriage Bariésun 100 Extreme Protective Fluid, which has better filters, with Tinosorb M, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Uvinul T 150, Avobenzone, and Tinosorb S. The bottle is also slightly larger and the price per ml is about half the Ultra-Light Fluid so it's a more cost-effective purchase. \n\nHowever, Cosmetis has consistently failed me on shipping delivery times. My first box took 10 weeks to arrive and the second box was delivered to the wrong town. I'm still waiting on that one to get here. I was going to wait on posting this until I received it, but that would be sometime in May! I don't want to wait that long and I know everyone is eagerly researching sunscreens with summer around the corner, so I decided to nix it for now. If you've tried this or any other sunscreen in the Uriage Bariésun line, tell us about it! Give us a review in the comments. \n\nYou can read reviews of the Uriage Bariésun Lotion for Kids SPF 50+ and Uriage Bariésun Mat Fluid SPF 50+ in [this review post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/lk0zos/sun_care_recent_european_american_sunscreens/) by /u/balt-amour. \n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/uriage-bariesun-ultra-light-fluid-spf50)\n\n**Price**: $16.18 for 30 ml ($0.53 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/ktBUsdf)\n\n#More reviews in comment below.

        "body": "#MORE REVIEWS -- Part Three\n\n**(11) Black Girl Sunscreen (BGS) Kids SPF 50**\n\n**Filters**: Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 15%, Octisalate 5% \n\n**Key Facts**: Vegan, Cruelty Free, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Paraben Free, Reef Safe\n\n**Marketing Claims**: The primary selling point and hallmark of this brand is the lack of white cast, which makes it suitable for POC. I can't personally vouch for its performance on that front (23andme says that I'm 99.8% white person) but there are many other reviews that back up this claim. The sunscreen is packed with moisturizing ingredients to minimize irritation, including chamomile, shea butter, jojoba oil, carrot seed oil, avocado, aloe, and sunflower seed oil. I'm not really one to go for products with a lot of botanicals, but these ingredients all carry the \"goodie\" rating on INCI Decoder and I haven't reacted to any of these in the past, as far as I know. \n\nIn particular, the evidence for shea butter is mixed. It has [anti-inflammatory properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22499721/) and [anti-fungal properties](http://jddtonline.info/index.php/jddt/article/view/1314) but the American Academy of Dermatology Association warns that it can [clog pores and cause acne in skin of color](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/DIY/skin-color). Despite the benefits these ingredients offer, I feel like it's probably safest to avoid heavy oils like shea butter, cocoa butter, and coconut oil if you are acne-prone.\n\nI also want to write something about Avobenzone, the only UVA blocker in this formulation. It has been shown to degrade significantly in light, with ~36% reduction in avobenzone's UV absorbance following one hour of exposure to sunlight. This degradation can be reduced by using a photostabilizer, like Octocrylene, Octisalate, Tinosorb S, or Tinosorb M. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avobenzone)) I'm not a chemist and I'm not an expert in SPF formulation, but I wonder if Avobenzone is enough to give this product adequate UVA protection? It's an American product, so the market puts very little emphasis on UVA blocking and the brand probably didn't feel any pressure to optimize that aspect of the formula. I wish the US FDA had adopted PA/PPD ratings so we would have a sense of the UVA protection.\n\nThe BASF sunscreen simulator isn't available right now, but the calculator on MakingCosmetics spits out a possible SPF of 24 for the BGS Kids. Please take that number with a whole heaping handful of salt, because there are a bunch of other variables and ingredients that go into sunscreen formulation that can change it. Either way, I'm kinda sus and I don't trust this stuff to give me good enough protection. I wish BGS shared independent testing results or a PPD/PA number. That would help to put my mind at ease. Even though I love skincare drama, I would hate for BGS to go through a Purito-style reckoning... knock on wood.\n\n**Impressions**: After reading [this fabulous review](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/l3e3sw/review_my_review_of_black_girl_sunscreen_kids/) by /u/teddivan96, I decided to buy some of this magic stuff. I was a little wary about the UVA protection, but moved forward with the purchase anyway because it's cheap! I'm also susceptible to hype and the brand founder seems nice on Instagram. \n\nThis all-chemical sunscreen performed identically to the Pipette all-zinc sunscreen (see review below) upon first application. It's thick and pasty white at first, but rubs in clear with a little elbow grease. It has a slight sunscreen-ish scent to it but it didn't really bother me. Unlike the Pipette sunscreen, it irritated my eyes and eyelids, which began to burn immediately. I would call this a cream-to-oil texture. After applying it, it became VERY greasy and sticky; my hair kept sticking to my face and my fingers came away oily when I touched my face. It legitimately felt like I was in the middle of oil cleansing. The texture was like DHC cleansing oil, which is largely olive oil. I looked like Severus Snape after visiting the Hogwarts sauna room. BGS has a matte sunscreen with SPF 45 that probably solves this problem. If you're worried about feeling greasy, you should try that one instead. \n\nAs I wore this, I felt prickly irritation on my cheeks like a thousand mosquito bites. I ended up washing it off after a few hours, before the sun even set that day. You can see in the photos that my face was flared up with painful red splotches. The next morning, I woke up to three (3) new red bumps on my face, two of them in areas where I never break out. I haven't had any acne in more than six months, but BGS Kids broke me out after four hours of wear. If this is what the *kids* version is like, I will never try any of this brand's other products; I imagine they're a breakout in a bottle. Overall, BGS is a hard nope and a huge disappointment. \n\nI want to reiterate that I am not the brand's target customer and they probably don't care that some random white girl didn't like their product. This sunscreen wasn't made for me, and I'm okay with that.\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/black-girl-sunscreen-bgs-kids-spf-50)\n\n**Price**: $9.99 for 89 ml ($0.11 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/1PtbzU3)\n\n#More reviews in comment below.

        "body": "#MORE REVIEWS -- Part Four\n\n**(12) Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with Sunscreen SPF 50+**\n\n**Filters**: Octinoxate 7.5%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 7%, Oxybenzone 6%, Titanium Dioxide (Micronized) 5.7%\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Cetaphil is our favorite boring brand. The product page says it is \"clinically tested hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic, so it won't irritate skin or clog pores\" and \"clinically proven to be gentle on sensitive skin.\" It also says that it's \"non greasy\" and \"absorbs quickly and leaves no filmy, white residue.\"\n\nThe formulation is no-frills. There aren't any fun or interesting ingredients to showcase. Even the Vanicream SPF 50 (which may have been discontinued? angels weep) has some squalane in it for moisturizing purposes, while Cetaphil stuck with glycerin. It seems like a basic-ass moisturizer with some sunscreen filters thrown in so they could market another product and take up more shelf space at your local drugstore. \n\nOxybenzone (Benzophenone-3) is controversial and may have safety issues. Its molecules are small and lipophilic (oil loving), which results in very good absorption. The problem is that you want sunscreens on the top of your skin and not in your bloodstream. Oxybenzone absorbs so well that it can be detected in urine just four hours after application. (Source: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/benzophenone-3)) This [article by JAMA Dermatology](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/1105240) says \"in a human study, oxybenzone did not demonstrate significant endocrine disruption, even with a formulation containing 10% oxybenzone. In fact, after 40 years of use, we are not aware of any published study that demonstrates acute toxic effects in humans with systemic absorption of oxybenzone.\" This is the only sunscreen in this review that contains Oxybenzone.\n\nSince this is also a US sunscreen, it's useful to compare it against the BGS Kids sunscreen. This is a combination SPF with five filters, while the BGS one is a chemical SPF with three filters. The MakingCosmetics calculator claims the Cetaphil is SPF 63! This is an extremely preliminary and incomplete figure, but it sounds like good news on that front.\n\nCetaphil's parent company is Galderma Laboratories, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nestlé.\n\n**Impressions**: I originally intended to buy one of Cetaphil's EU sunscreens (UVA/UVB Defense SPF50 Daytime Moisturizer), which has Tinosorb S, Avobenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Mexoryl SX, Mexoryl XL, and Uvinul T 150. However, I ended up choosing a candidate from their US line instead, because it's cheaper and more accessible. If the EU version is anything like the US one, I'll have to try it out sooner or later.\n\nThe texture feels similar to Olay Complete SPF 15 and SPF 30, which I used as my sole moisturizer throughout high school and college. It's worth noting that the [Olay Complete formulation](https://incidecoder.com/products/olay-complete-daily-defense-all-day-moisturizer-with-sunscreen-spf-30-for-sensitive-skin) includes aloe, squalane, niacinamide, panthenol, zinc, and green tea so it's a far better and more, dare I say, *complete* moisturizer. If only it came in an SPF 50+ version!! I would use that until I die. Olay executives, if you're reading this, hit me up!\n\nThis is one of the only products I tried where my skin felt exactly the same before and after applying it. I used six pumps for one application. It's a white cream that rubs in clear right away, so I had no trouble applying liberal amounts all over my face, eyes, neck, shoulders, and chest. I even smeared some on my pink t-shirt accidentally but it didn't leave any stain. This sunscreen is inoffensive, absorbs quickly with zero stickiness, provides a decent amount of moisture, and doesn't cause trouble. It's neither greasy nor drying. I saw no redness, felt no irritation, and didn't experience any annoying side effects like pilling or white cast. This is the sunscreen equivalent of a kindergartener bringing a No. 2 pencil to show and tell. \n\nFor all that the filters in this product are potentially (probably) less effective than the EU version, it's a pretty damn good option for very sensitive skin. There's not much to write about, and I kind of love that. Very on-brand for Cetaphil. If you're in the US and not able to purchase Asian, EU, or Australian products, this is a very good, accessible option for you.\n\nCetaphil must have gotten wise to the outrageous profit margins that EU, Japanese, and Korean brands were generating with their tiny bottle sizes. This one is only 50 ml and looks silly next to standard American size bottles (3 oz+). I'm sure that's why they decided to package it in a big box to fool less-savvy customers. I got a pack of two bottles for a little over $30, so overall the price is not bad. I think I might just hate tiny bottles of sunscreen.\n\nI'm not going to share other reviews because I found that aggregate websites grouped this US product with the UK version, which I don't think is the same formulation. I wasn't able to tell which version the reviewer was using (other than telltale US-UK spelling differences) so I had to wash my hands of it. \n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/cetaphil-cetaphil-daily-facial-moisturizer-broad-spectrum-spf50-fragrance-free)\n\n**Price**: $16.79 for 50 ml ($0.33 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/VW5APxj)\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**(13) Coppertone Pure & Simple Baby SPF 50**\n\n**Filters**: Zinc Oxide (24.08%)\n\n**Key Facts**: Fragrance Free, Dye Free, Alcohol Free, Essential Oil Free, Paraben Free, Sulfate Free, Waterproof (80 Minutes)\n\n**Marketing Claims**: Here it is, the classic all-American zinc sunscreen, at a very high 24% concentration. This is another baby sunscreen (you know how I love \"baby\" branded stuff) to compare with the other mineral sunscreens listed below. The marketing describes it as \"tear free,\" meaning that it shouldn't irritate eyes. The Coppertone website says that it's the \"most gentle and hypoallergenic sunscreen\" in their extensive product portfolio. \n\nIt has a bunch of \"100% natural\" botanicals with calming and soothing properties (tea leaf, sea kelp, and lotus extracts). Zinc itself also has soothing properties, particularly for inflammatory acne, rosacea, and eczema. [Read more about zinc therapy in dermatology in this study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120804/) For anyone allergic to honey/bees, this contains beeswax (cera alba). It also has a bunch of silicones, but very few moisturizing ingredients.\n\nIt is both interesting and hilarious that all three sunscreens in the Pure & Simple line are (as far as I can tell) identical, although they use different branding for adult, kids, and baby versions. [See this thread with a direct comparison of ingredients lists.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/grzc84/product_question_these_3_coppertone_pure_and/) As /u/DarrenFromFinance points out, \"this is called brand extension and it's very common. If you have three apparently different products, you can take up three times as much shelf space for visual impact and sell a lot more product — a shopper might buy the adult-branded bottle for herself and then the children's version for the kids, not knowing that they're the same product.\" \n\n**Impressions**: I inadvertently packed this in my bag (read: I stole it) after a beach trip with the family, so this was definitely purchased for an actual child and not for an obsessive adult. One of my best beach towels didn't come home with me, so I consider that a fair trade. \n\nIn terms of texture, it's a very runny liquid that comes out of the bottle quickly, so it's difficult to moderate how much you squeeze out. I shook the living hell out of the bottle to make sure it hadn't separated before I opened it up to try it out. It's impossible to measure using the finger method because it drips everywhere, so I'm pretty sure I used a little more than a standard application for my face and neck. I found it difficult to blend by either rubbing or patting. \"Pasty\" is the best word I can use to describe how I looked, with white cast equivalent to the Isntree Perfect Sun Block but with none of the cosmetic elegance. I couldn't find lighting that made my skin look like skin and not grey play-doh. I felt sticky and uncomfortable, and progressively drier over time. This is not moisturizing and seemed to suck the hydration out of my cheeks. I always lather up in the morning with serums and my BFF Vanicream, but that wasn't enough to maintain hydration while wearing this Coppertone sunscreen.\n\nThe marketing claims this is waterproof but I don't agree at all. I wore this on a humid, rainy day (hello spring!) and I couldn't get it to stay put on my face. It never really dried down; anything that brushed against my face for the briefest moment came back tacky and white, even 20 minutes after initial application. I had to tuck paper towels into my black hoodie so it wouldn't rub off onto the fabric. If I tried to swim or work out while wearing this, I'm sure it would wash off right away. Thank goodness the UV index was low (2) that day! Further, it came off with no trouble with cleanser and water, so I think the \"waterproof\" claim is dubious at best. On a positive note, it didn't irritate my eyes even a tiny bit, even when I smeared some on my waterline. It is indeed \"tear free,\" even for my dry eyes.\n\n**Ingredients**: [INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/coppertone-pure-simple-baby-tear-free-spf-50)\n\n**Price**: $8.97 for 177 ml ($0.05 per ml)\n\n**Photos**: [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/9FIK082)\n\n#More reviews in comment below.

So I’d like to share them as giving back to this community! \n\n\nTips for shopping on Stylevana:\n\n1.\t**Never add items to your shopping cart from your wishlist or the brand’s product page.** The reason is because not only does the price fluctuate greatly, same items also have different prices on different pages on Stylevana. For example, for the exact same product, the price seems to be the highest on your wishlist page  (can be $1-8 usd higher!), and by clicking on the product when you search it directly on Stylevana. \n\n\n2.\t**The best price can usually be found on “Secret Member Sale” page or by searching “[product name] + deal” on Google (not on Stylevana!).** I learned this from this sub. From those pages you can safely add the items to your shopping cart, and they will appear to have “[Deal]” in front of their product name in your shopping cart. Some of these [deal] items can be excluded from further discounts, but it’s usually worth it because their price is already low enough. \n\n\n3.\t**Always check Stylevana’s Instagram before checking out.** I used to shop by only using the promo code Stylevana sent in the email, but those are not the best promo codes! The best promo codes are usually on their Instagram, where a single promo code gives you the same amount of % off plus sometimes awesome freebies! I got the SKIN1004 100ml Centella ampoule and I’m from Mugwort 30ml as part of their Instagram promo code!\n\n\n4.\t**If you’re buying more than two products from the same brand, it’s worthwhile checking the “SALE” page, underneath you would find all the brand freebies.** There’s a chance that your favorite brand might be giving freebies and that the product you wanted to buy might be a freebie! The Purito B5 cream, which I was planning to buy, suddenly appeared in my shopping cart as a free item when I added three Purito items to my shopping cart. And that’s when I discovered that brands gives their own freebies without needing to apply any promo codes. I was very curious and wondered where I could find brand gift page, so I looked and looked and found it on the SALE page. \n\n\n5.\t**Best time to shop if 2 weeks before or after major sales season. Never buy during a major sales season (Thanksgiving, New Year, etc). ** Because Stylevana jacked up their price during sale. I also learned this from this sub. \n\n\n6.\t**Time your supplies! Items appear as “ship within 30 days” do take much longer to ship.** It’s not a myth! Several items in this order had “ship within 30 days” and that’s why it took nearly a month to ship. My past orders usually only take less than two weeks to deliver. \n\nThat’s it!",

        "body": "I tried to do the deal hack you mentioned in number 2. I searched up the product and deal on google. It comes up with it and says it’s $21 but when I click on it, it says it’s $25. What am I doing wrong? I tried it both in a regular window and a incognito window. I also tried just clicking the add discount code link that appears below the item when you search it. Instead of clicking the item and then adding it to my cart. Doesn’t work\n\n🌟🌟EDIT: I just wanted to come back and let y’all know what I found. So I tried the hack mentioned above. I searched up each product with deal on google and added them to my cart. I ended up wanting to do a little comparison between 3 sites. \n\nStylevanna, YesStyle, and StyleKorean. I tried this many different ways. I did all three sits on separate tabs on incognito tabs and regular tabs. (At the end, the regular tabs are better because if it refreshes you don’t lose everything in your cart. And there was no price difference between incognito and regular tabs.) \n\nI don’t know why -but I then decided to compare all three cart prices online to the prices on the app. (every cart was pretty much the same except for maybe one or two products being on one sight but not another) \n\nSo in total I had a tab online with Stylevanna “deals” and then searched everything on the Stylevanna app and added that to my cart. \n\nI had the same with YesStyle. \n\nAnd with StyleKorean I just used online because I didn’t have the app. \n\nStylevanna - What I found was that it was actually CHEAPER for me on the StyleVanna app when directly searching something up then searching it online with deal behind it. I will admit that you should check the secret member site in its entirety because I ended up buying something that was $3 cheaper on the secret member site. \n\nYesStyle - there was no difference between the app price and the online price. \n\nAnd StyleKorean only had one price. \n\nNOW there is a caveat to this, or at least from what I understand and that would be your “Status” on Stylevanna. \n\nI had ordered from Stylevanna one time before, so I had an account already made. The order was a pretty big order and I am assuming that changes my membership status. My membership status at the time I did this comparison is SUPER FAN. So I automatically had a 6% discount on all items. So my cart on the app was around $20-$30 dollars cheaper then online. I also noticed that more free gifts were added to my cart on the app than online. I mean most of the free gifts were added but not all of them. I only got all of them when I was on the app. \n\n\n🌟SOOOO… the online search hack works, IF you dont already have an account and don’t plan to purchase again. If you are placing a pretty big order or you see yourself purchasing something again at least in the same year, then I would recommend making an account. Not only is it beneficial to rack up points for member status but you also get emails with REALLY good discounts. Sometimes better than the ones on their Instagram.\n\nAnother thing - it could just be my bank but when I went to check out my bank thought it was fraud - which happened the first time. I let them know it’s not and go to finalize the purchase but the code I got from their Instagram won’t work anymore. So if there’s a code that is really good and has freebies that you really want to try then maybe try using a different code first. But you do run the risk of your bank accepting the payment the first time. Both times - and I’ve only purchased twice so that isn’t a lot of evidence- but both times I’ve tried to purchase, it first gets denied and then I have to try again. I was just lucky enough both times to find and EVEN BETTER code than the first one I was using. \n\nHope that helps😊",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat.

It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.  I have just read a blog entry about TO Mandelic vs Stratia Mandelic and found it very informative.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

    "body": "Hi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories. They all use the patented ceramides.\n\n* [**RealBarrier's Extreme Cream**](http://www.atopalmglobal.com/product/proDetail.asp?brand=3&cate=332&Pcate=217&Mcate=) \\#3 Top Creams (4.11/5 out of 6,153 Reviews) **fragranced**  [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/REAL-BARRIER-Extreme-Cream-50ml-BEST-Korea-Cosmetic/312419244657?epid=1740451843&hash=item48bda35a71:g:Kp4AAOSwoEFcM~bo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Aestura Ato Barrier Cream**](https://www.aestura.com/web/product/view.do?prdSeq=1004)  \\#6 Top Creams (4.23/5 out of 2,524 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Mamonde's Moisture Ceramide Intense Cream**](https://www.mamonde.com/int/en/product/ceramide-intense-cream.html) \\#15 Top Creams (3.94/5 out of 2,840 Reviews) **fragranced**    [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/MAMONDE-Ceramide-Intense-Cream-50ml/392296451084?epid=8032468017&hash=item5b56b0cc0c%3Ag%3A9wMAAOSwMMNc2mEr&LH_BIN=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Intensive Cream**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=281) (4.21/5 out of 1,539 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Zeroid's Soothing Cream** (4.12/5 out of 1,768 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Richenic Cream Urea 5%**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284) **-** not many reviews as this is new, but FANTASTIC ingredients.

It doesn't bother her skin, and really helps calm her skin & works well under makeup. She also highly recommends the soothing gel for summer & concentrate cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** (4.20/5 out of 3,162 Reviews)\n\n[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ILLIYOON-Ceramide-Ato-Concentrate-Cream-200ml/132526755796)\n\n[Apmall](http://global.amorepacificmall.com/en/shop/pr/illiyoon/P000006418/shop_product_view.do?i_sProductcd=P000006418)\n\n[Mini-review by Dr. Dray @ 13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1X4RmFTJQ8&t=877s)\n\nThis cream has little beads in it that break up when you apply, according to reviewers. Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the \"scrubby bits\" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.\n\nWhile Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**\n\n>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk. But if you count it, then there are more options, like [Gold Bond Men's Essentials](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-men-s-essentials-hand-face-and-body-lotions-14-5oz/-/A-14507966), or the [Strength & Resilience Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-strength-and-resilienc-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-16453690) and [Unscented Diabetic Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-gold-bond-diabetic-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-15025375) (EDIT: AND [Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion for face](https://www.target.com/p/cetaphil-moisturizing-lotion-unscented-16oz/-/A-10300852)) for fragrance-free options.\n\n[Triderma Eczema Fast Healing Face % Body Cream](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991)\\- not sure %, but it looks pretty high. I actually have the old version of this, before they reformulated. It used to have 3% colloidal oatmeal!!!!!!!!! Which is higher than any I've seen at the time. It's really thick and is really tacky on my face. It doesn't have a \\~nice sillicone-y feel\\~. It absorbs all the way by morning tho when I slug life with it.

Personal reviews can be very helpful, but after seeing my billionth \"OMG L-AA worked for me overnight!\" review (no, it almost certainly didn't, it was more likely something else in the product like a humectant or emollient), I've learned to take them with a grain of salt.\n\nI found [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799034/) but quick Googling isn't finding much else that isn't related to atopic dermatitis, though I'm on mobile so my Google skills are limited at the moment.\n\nEdit: Also, I know this is the AB sub but since OP brought up Eucerin, Eucerin has an **Roughness Relief Lotion** that is *possibly* 10% urea. The ingredients for the lotion are (or at least were last time I checked) identical to their UreaRepair PLUS 10% Urea Lotion. I asked Eucerin if they could confirm the percentage of the RRL, but they declined, saying they only disclose what they legally have to. **Udderly Smooth** also makes products with urea, including at 10% and 20%. At the moment I use the Eucerin Advanced Repair on my face daily, but use the Udderly Smooth Extra Care Cream (with 10%) in the cooler months. I use the Roughness Relief on my body (I have KP on my arms and legs, and urea's been *immensely* helpful for it), but found it *way* too greasy for my face.

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nI wanted to review all the Isntree products I have tried over the past few years in one place for anyone who is looking into the brand. I find them to be basically unrivaled when it comes to ingredient lists, and have been tempted into buying essentially their entire line as a result. I get rewards through winning contests at work, and bought many of these in the 50% off sale on Stylevana, so I tried these gradually over the course of three years.\n\nI am at the halfway point between white and tan skin, I have dry skin in the winter/oily skin in the summer, and you’ll find my routine below:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Rinse with water\n2. Hydrating toner/essence\n3. Fermented essence\n4. Niacinamide serum\n5. Gel cream\n6. Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n1. Oil cleanse\n2. Second cleanse\n3. AM steps 2-5\n4. Heavy Cream\n\nI have a bias against serums in the way that they are less product for more money, so I will hold it against them if they're not justifying that. I also strongly dislike silicones, which is something else that other people won't necessarily share.\n\nI’m going to format it by product type, and will rate it on a scale of 1-5. You can assume I will at some point probably repurchase a product (on sale) unless otherwise noted. I have reviewed some of these before, so I will be using a bulk of what I said before on those with added updates. One final note is that I don’t fully remember some of these to give a full review, so some won’t have scores but rather descriptions and impressions. Alright, let’s dive in!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCreams:\n\nOnion Newpair Gel Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a great option and one of their best moisturizers - I am shallow so I won’t lie about being obsessed with the slight purple hue. I’ve seen it retail from $10 USD all the way up to $40, and I have no idea why haha. It is not a holy grail hyperpigmentation treatment, but it is fantastic at evening out skin tone and giving you a nice healthy glow. It has 71% Onion Extract as well as Niacinamide, which are the two main ingredients I would purchase this for. While it has tranexamic acid, a vitamin c derivative, and a bunch of other great ingredients; they are probably all well below .1%. This does dry down pretty quickly, so it makes a fantastic daily moisturizer under sunscreen. What I love about this gel cream is that your face could be violently wet, but this would still apply like a normal moisturizer. It absorbs moisture and locks in whatever you’ve done before better than most, which is a compliment I’d pay to a lot of their gel creams. I wish this one didn’t have dimethicone, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nC-Niacin Toning Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a very similar cream to the Onion Newpair, but instead of a light purple, it’s a vibrant orange. Trade onions for sea buckthorn, and you’d get this product. This is better to me, though, because of the fact it is their cheapest moisturizer almost at all times, the lovely yet natural smell, and it is the best glow booster I have ever used. It dries down so well, but it will leave you with a glowy, hydrated complexion while staying dry to the touch. It is glass skin in a tube, essentially. The blend of oils, addition of beta glucan, and removal of dimethicone just overall makes this their best cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCica Relief Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is a strange addition to their catalog and it seems like they’ve phased out the entire line, perhaps to relaunch it as they do. It is one of those creams that further emulsifies on contact with water, so it becomes impossible to use if you use the wet skin method. It is legitimately impossible to blend in without white streaks. The ingredient list is impressive with basically everything you could ask for (especially the peptides whew), but its lack of utility would never make me feel comfortable recommending it. It is also piss-poor at locking in moisture because of this, which is again pretty point defeating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Moist Cream\n\nImpressions: I did rate this in a recent point somewhat poorly, but in retrospect it really is a decent cream. I find that you need to apply it to a dryer face as it will end up not very significant on a wet face. I don’t find I have this issue with the aqua, but for this one I remember just not being able to feel any kind of locked in feeling I like to feel from moisturizers. I’m going to try it again one day, maybe this summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Aqua Cream\n\n4/5 \n\nI like this cream a lot, and have already repurchased it. I rate it lower because it is both not significant enough to be used alone most of the time, while also leaving a pretty glowy finish if used alone. I will typically use this at night before another moisturizer, and will use a more natural-finish sunscreen if used during the day. I find this to be intensely hydrating in a way most moisturizers fall short, however, and will stay loyal to this just for the punch it packs in that department. I will often combine it with squalane or hemisqualane to give it an additional oomph, but this is for sure a go-to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\n5/5\n\nThis is an all-time great. They struck gold with this formulation, and I hope they never stop making it. I have bought at least 15 of these, and considering how much I like to try new things, something becoming a staple means something haha. I would describe this as a goopy occlusive containing almost no occlusives that somehow just works. If you use it as your final step, your skin will be well protected and wake up so hydrated. If you want to use it as a serum, it absolutely smashes all other hydrating serums and you only need a little. I will alternate between both using it as a serum and an occlusive depending on the weather. One drawback is that it is so THICK that you do need to melt it down in your hands sometimes depending on how much you’re using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut PHA Clear Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother fantastic product that is actually super new. They used to have a PHA sleeping mask that caught them in hot water because it had some fragrant extract (lol), but this updated version adds chestnut extract and removes any fragrance. According to their insta, they wanted this to be more of a daily moisturizer akin to the onion and c-niacin creams, and I’d say they mostly succeeded in doing this. The ingredient list is another humble brag, and I’d say overall this has helped me so much with daily usage. The benefits of getting minor exfoliation every single day kind of speak for themselves. I will say that this doesn’t dry down as well as their other daily moisturizers, but I would just use less of it if this bothers you. I also find it doesn’t “lock in” as well as some moisturizers do, but having a PHA 5% gel cream is just too useful for me to not love it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMugwort Spot Gel Cream\n\n4/5\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I find it suspicious that this doesn’t smell like mugwort even a little bit. I could add a drop of One Thing’s Mugwort toner and make this thing so fragrant, so I am just a bit confused there haha. This is very, very similar to the onion and c-niacin creams in the way that it locks in everything really well and dries down quickly. It doesn’t have Niacinamide, which is a bit of a drawback overall to me, but if you are one of the B3 haters out there, then this would be the one for you. It does a great job at reducing redness and was a great medicinal treatment of a burn I got recently. I’d recommend this cream up and down, but it is typically just a bit too expensive for what it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a unique product in their line as it is their only moisturizer outside of the HA sleeping mask that aims to be heavy. It has 57% yam root extract with a bunch of other great, soothing/brightening extracts like rice, soybean, and oat. It also has 5 ceramides and cholesterol, which isn’t a common feature for them. This does dry down pretty well, but not nearly as well as the others, seemingly by design. It applies like a luxury cream and was so similar to Then I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream that I just put the rest of the cream in that packaging and mixed it with hemisqualane to provide even more moisture. This is their best moisturizer for people with dry skin IMO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4.25/5\n\nI recently reviewed this on here and gave it a worse score and a mediocre review. I would like to publicly apologize. This is for sure not a summer sunscreen, but I find I can wear it almost all year round and look incredibly healthy without eating a single vegetable. (This is a joke please stay well nourished.) It is so oily on me if used in humid weather, and is one of the more emollient sunscreens I’ve used in Korean and Japanese beauty. In the winter I see that as a plus! It is a runny but significant emulsion type liquid, spreads really well and evenly, and is an easy sunscreen to reapply as it will never pill for me. Overall a big fan!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToners:\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Toner\n\n2.5/5\n\nI find that this toner didn’t do much of anything. I love the experience of using it as it smells amazing, but it has this slipperiness to it that I couldn’t really get behind. It is purported to have a complex that helps with oil control, but I don’t find this to be something the product does well. It has a series of botanical extracts, beta glucan, hydrolyzed HA, and allatoin. It is very no frills, and something I’d recommend if green tea works well for you. For me, this didn’t hydrate much at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Toner Plus\n\n5/5\n\nThis is essentially a top-quality hyaluronic acid serum packaged as a toner and sold at an excellent price. I will forever return to it because if used sparingly like a serum, it can last you a year. It’s gorgeously goopy, smells just a bit funky, and will at times foam when used in large quantities and allowed to lather on the skin. I have been told this is not a red flag, and will pass this vague assurance onto you. Both this and the normal HA toner are composed of 50% HA aqueous solution, but this one has 5 types of HA rather than the 3 in the standard. There are a host of typical botanical extracts like centella, birch juice, rosemary, and licorice. Sodium PCA, beta glucan, and panthenol round out a beautiful ingredient list and a super hydrating product I have already repurchased. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Toner\n\n4/5\n\nThis is a basic hydrating toner, and doesn’t try to be anything more. No active ingredients, no frills, just a solution of 50% hyaluronic acid composed of three different kinds, other humectants like glycerin and beta glucan; and some barrier supporting ingredients like panthenol and sodium PCA. It’s slightly more viscous than water, so it is far more dispensable than the plus version. As far as the effect of it goes, it is expectedly super hydrating, and softens the skin upon application. All of the other toners they have are like upgraded versions of this, so I won’t repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Essence Toner\n\n5/5\n\nThis is the perfect toner in my opinion. I often look for and extract based as opposed to water, 2-4% niacinamide, watery texture, and a decent amount of humectants; and this delivers on all in spades. I enjoy the purple color, and do find that the onion extract supports the product in a way that yields brightness and evens out skin tone. It has a skin-softening effect once applied, and feels like a burst of hydration. It is overall somewhat basic, but it succeeds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Vegan Milk Toner\n\nImpressions: I dropped this product in the sink while it was full of water, so I threw it away after only a few uses. It is 80% yam root extract, and is otherwise what I would describe as a Cream Skin Refiner with a much more complete ingredient list. As far as ingredients, it has a well-selected series of oils like meadowfoam seed, argan, sunflower, and macadamia; a milk replacement themed list (lol) of extracts like oat, almond, and rice; and some barrier supporting ingredients like panthenol, ceramide NP, and cholesterol. This is a top tier milky toner, and I enjoyed it while I had it haha\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Clear Pad\n\n5/5\n\nI very much enjoyed using these in the morning instead of rinsing my face with water. The pads are soft, somewhat easy to separate, and are adequately soaked in product. The ingredient list is a bit simpler, and in my opinion better than the toner as it mostly gets rid of the botanical extracts to focus on the barrier-supporting ingredients like Panthenol, hyaluronic acids, allantoin and adenosine. The tranexamic acid and vitamin c derivative are also higher up on this ingredient list, but that doesn’t mean anything necessarily. Once done using this, my skin is super glowy and healthy looking to the point where I don’t know if I need to do anything else. These are often super expensive, like the rest of this line; but you will be able to find everything here for cheap on Stylevana at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSerums:\n\n(their new serum packaging is super ugly, will try not to mention this again)\n\nC-Niacin Toning Ampoule\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis would get a perfect 5 out of 5 from me if it were less watery. From my perspective, serums have a certain responsibility to have a certain viscosity to them so that they feel a bit more significant and spreadable on the skin. This felt like a toner packaged in 50ml serum packaging, if that makes sense. Apart from that, this is a top tier product. It focuses on superfoods like sea buckthorn, pumpkin, and turmeric; while having a great ingredient list featuring niacinamide at the top. It is a bit too basic for a serum, for me, as I typically will only buy serums for a buffet type product. This would get a 5/5 as a toner\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Serum\n\n1.5/5\n\nI found this serum to be super oily, and it broke me out. I really couldn’t tell you why when looking at the ingredient list, but I ended up using it on my body because I just really didn’t like it. This has a great ingredient list, but again I just hold serums to higher standards (as we should) and this is fairly basic for them. Again, if a green tea-based oily serum appeals to you, however, I would definitely recommend this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpot Saver Mugwort Ampoule:\n\nImpressions: I ended up just combining this somewhat early on with a One Thing toner and using it on my body, so I don’t deserve to rate this. I find this to be mid as far as mugwort products go, and that is overall the extract my skin fucks with the most. It has a perfectly serviceable ingredient list with beta glucan, panthenol, and ceramides all combining to create what is in the end an effective serum. I would recommend One Thing’s Artemisa Toner over this, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCleansers:\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Cleanser:\n\n5/5\n\nI love this cleanser so much. It smells insanely good, has this amazing goopy texture, and it has tea leaves in it. I find that they don’t do much exfoliation, and I honestly never see them again after cleansing it off. It is surprisingly gentle for being so thorough. This feels like a luxury cleanser, and is better than almost every luxury cleanser I’ve tried for cheap. Count me as a big fan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Cleansing Foam:\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis was my HG cleanser for a while, and while I wouldn’t buy it again, I will describe it to identify why that is and why it might work for you. I have water that rinses cleansers off well, but when I go to other people’s places I find that film-leaving cleansers will be difficult to completely remove, which bothers me. This has your typical whipped creamy cleanser texture, with a slight purple tint. I am not a fan of this type of cleanser as it is everywhere in Asian Beauty, it a bit stripping, and is somewhat difficult to completely remove. If you are looking for a thorough creamy cleanser with added brightening benefits, then this is it. Final note: it smells like caramel corn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut LHA Jelly Cleansing Oil\n\n1/5\n\nI would consider this something of a formulation failure in the way that it is almost impossible to get an oil texture out of this. Naturium also has a first step cleanser like this: it just spreads like a gel. You have to really rub it in, and I need to have some slip to my cleanser as I have skin that is sensitive to rubbing, so this wasn’t something I could really use. I also can’t imagine it is super adept at removing makeup as a result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser:\n\n4/5\n\nThis is a great cleanser for people who have sensitive skin, but only on wet skin. I used this as a second step cleanser when I wanted a non-foaming option, and it always left my skin so soft and well-cleansed. I don’t have too much purpose for it as I would prefer other non-foaming options purchased locally, but this is the best non-foaming AB cleanser I’ve used by far. It does, however, fail at being a makeup remover/first step as it is truly like a cream. It just sinks in. You can’t get any slip on it because your skin is drinking it up. Apart from this, I do recommend it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything Else:\n\nChestnut BHA 2% Clear Liquid:\n\n4.5/5\n\nThere are so many BHA liquids on the market, but this is a really solid one if you are looking. It is a simple ingredient list with 3 types of hyaluronic acid, allantoin, and glycerin. I have really not much to add - it is watery and thin, sinks in quickly, and is super friendly to sensitive skin. Peach Slice’s has the best version of this, though, IMO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut AHA 8% Clear Essence\n\n4.5/5\n\nLike the BHA, this is one of the best options for the type of exfoliant it is. It is a massive upgrade from the previous version as it removes the fragrance and adds the chestnut extract, which I do enjoy. I find that when I use this, my pores look so clean and healthy. It has 4% both glycolic and lactic acids, which I enjoy as most multi-AHA exfoliants are mostly composed of glycolic acid with a low concentration of any others present. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMugwort Calming Clay Mask\n\n4/5\n\nI find clay masks almost all the same, so this doesn’t get altogether too much praise from me in the way that it’s very similar to other products. However, it is the best clay mask I’ve used as far as experience goes as it smells really nice (IMO), has large enough granules to not feel like a scrub, can be easily combined with serums or spot treatments (it will usually get really creamy like mint ice cream), and dries down quickly. I love the tugging/tightening sensation of clay masks, and I will say this one does deliver.\n\nSo that’s it! I clearly love this brand. I want to acknowledge that people aren’t always big fans because they use preservatives that have not historically yielded the desired results. I have never had a product go bad on me, and I haven’t experience a product becoming less effective quickly. That doesn’t mean this hasn’t happened, though; as I have seen a lot of people on this sub mention it. I don’t know where Isntree is at with this, but it hasn’t impacted my experience in any capacity.\n\nIn looking at my reviews, I definitely prefer their toners and creams over everything else. If you have any questions for me, I am here! Thank you for reading.",

    "body": "My journey with closed comedones + acne as a PCOS girlie (without isotret)\n\n\nLong post ahead! 🫡\n\n\nI want to begin by saying that as someone who never struggled with intense acne growing up, it honestly crushed my self-esteem to be battling it today. Adult acne is a different kind of struggle. 🥹\n\n\nIt all started in 2024 when I grew white bumps on the side of my cheeks. Mid 2024 was basically a back and forth routine of me going to Skin Starion and getting Hyal-c facials to remedy it. \n\n\nA tortuous cycle of getting clear skin for 2 weeks post-facial, only for them to grow back again. Very unsustainable and saddening.\n\n\n*Dec 2024*\nI self-medicated, trying all the tiktok recos—from salicylic acid to eqqualberry swimming pool toner to skin 1004 products. \n\n\nBut I think the Cosrx salicylic acid ruined my skin and gave me really bad cystic acnes :( as I was applying it twice a day. \n\n\n*Jan 2025*\nI finally consulted with a derma online through the NowServing app. She was friendly! She put me on adapelene (klenzit cms) and benzoyl peroxide. Told me to trust the process, but these 3 months really made me doubt. \n\nI had visited with an OB and done some tests, which confirmed I had PCOS. But I wasn't open to taking BCP, so I didn't do anything to treat it. \n\n*March 2025*\nI still kept purging with the medication. I asked her if I could try Doxycycline (Tetralysal) to which she allowed. It stopped the cystic acne from growing, but it left me with really bad scars. At this time, I was continuing with Cetaphil as my cleanser, and Skin1004 hyalu-cica sunscreen. I used micellar water to double cleanse. \n\n\n*May 2025*\nI switched my derma as I wanted someone who could assess my skin in-person. Thankfully, it was HMO covered. She was really nice (hi Doc Giselle), and gave me lots of options. As I didn't want to resort to Isotret, she suggested we try facials + chemical peels nalang.  There were lots of comedones on my face that needed to be taken out kasi sobrang tagal na nila. \n\nShe said mas mahirap daw i-treat yung comedones kasi nasa ilalim siya, unlike the cystic acne na inflamed. \n\n\nWhat I liked about my new derma was that she allowed me to use my old skincare products, without judging me. So I switched back to my Human Nature Acne Facial Cleanser in the AM, and Cetaphil in PM. \n\n\nShe advised me to try Mineral Sunscreen, so I did. And it's one of the best decisions ever! Since I'm acne prone, I found that the mineral one didn't make my face oil up as much. So worth it naman yung Heliocare kahit 1,700 siya (almost 3x the price HUHU). She also put me on Azelaic acid + Vit C (both from her clinic). My moisturizer naman is the Numbuzin Panthenol Serum (contains niacinamide)\n\nNgl, I think I spent almost over 30k with the facials, medications, and skincare products combined. HAHA. But no regrets kasi I have a set routine na!\n\n*June 2025*\nMy skin improved so much! I can't afford Yellow Laser yet to remove the acne marks, so I just continue with my current routine. Hindi niya na ako pinapabalik sa clinic, unless for laser na. I'm really happy I got my closed comedones under control. Wala na ring bumps sa face. Acne marks nalang talaga. Sometimes I get occasional acne, and that's when I use my BP to treat it. \n\nI can now wear makeup without worrying about the bumps. I slowly regained my confidence. Looking back, it was one heck of a ride.\n\nThe last pic is my current routine for AM and PM. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading! 🤍 I hope I was able to inspire those battling comedones. So this is your sign to stop self-medicating and go to a derma! Mahirap kasi yung nag-eexperiment. Magastos lang talaga at first, huhu. \n\n\nIt gets better, I promise. We will see the light at the end! 🩷\n",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nThis is gonna be a really long one, so I’ll try to keep introductions brief. I love trying new things for the purpose of data, and sometimes I actually sit down and share it lol. I am going to go through what I look for in a moisturizer, my routine, and my skin type before getting to the reviews. The longer ones come first because when I wrote out this list, I decided to do it by brand, so the brands I had the most experience with ended up coming first.\n\nFor a moisturizer, it’s often difficult to nail down what works best. I have normal skin that leans combo or dry depending on the weather, so when I use a moisturizer I want something that will be significant, but not too emollient. For a daily moisturizer, I prefer something that dries down quickly, so that the time between that and my sunscreen can be minimized. There needs to be a certain thickness to it, though. If it applies like a serum, it’s a no for me. In addition, while I love when it dries down quickly, a lot of creams designed with this in mind end up taking away more than they add in terms of moisture. Ingredients like dimethicone, silicone, and hydrogenated lecithin leave me oily yet dry - I can tolerate them depending on the cream, but if it is a drawback I’ll mention it.\n\nMy routine is as follows:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Light cleanse (nothing, water, toning pads, or Sanskrit Saponins by NIOD)\n2. Toner\n3. Serum\n4. Daily moisturizer\n5. Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n1. Double cleanse\n2. Toner\n3. Serum\n4. Daily Moisturizer\n5. Treatment\n6. Occlusive\n\nI try to stay fragrance free, use as much Niacinamide as I can, and cover Ceramides, Peptides, Beta Glucan, and Panthenol through the routine I choose. I will be using a 5 point system based on my preferences, so stuff like fragrance being a negative for me is obviously not a negative for everyone.\n\nIsntree’s Onion Newpair Gel Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a great option and one of their best moisturizers - I am shallow so I won’t lie about being obsessed with the slight purple hue. I’ve seen it retail from $10 USD all the way up to $40, and I have no idea why haha. It is not a holy grail hyperpigmentation treatment, but it is fantastic at evening out skin tone and giving you a nice healthy glow. It has 71% Onion Extract as well as Niacinamide, which are the two main ingredients I would purchase this for. While it has tranexamic acid, a vitamin c derivative, and a bunch of other great ingredients; they are probably all well below .1%. This does dry down pretty quickly, so it makes a fantastic daily moisturizer under sunscreen. What I love about this gel cream is that your face could be violently wet, but this would still apply like a normal moisturizer. It absorbs moisture and locks in whatever you’ve done before better than most, which is a compliment I’d pay to a lot of their gel creams. I wish this one didn’t have dimethicone, though.\n\nIsntree’s C-Niacin Toning Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a very similar cream to the Onion Newpair, but instead of a light purple, it’s a vibrant orange. Trade onions for sea buckthorn, and you’d get this product. This is better to me, though, because of the fact it is their cheapest moisturizer almost at all times, the lovely yet natural smell, and it is the best glow booster I have ever used. It dries down so well, but it will leave you with a glowy, hydrated complexion while staying dry to the touch. It is glass skin in a tube, essentially. The blend of oils, addition of beta glucan, and removal of dimethicone just overall makes this their best cream.\n\nIsntree’s Cica Relief Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is a strange addition to their catalog and it seems like they’ve phased out the entire line, perhaps to relaunch it as they do. It is one of those creams that further emulsifies on contact with water, so it becomes impossible to use if you use the wet skin method. It is legitimately impossible to blend in without white streaks. The ingredient list is impressive with basically everything you could ask for (especially the peptides whew), but its lack of utility would never make me feel comfortable recommending it. It is also piss-poor at locking in moisture because of this, which is again pretty point defeating.\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is a serum, essentially. I can’t imagine what the Aqua is like, because the Moist version doesn’t lock anything in on a wet face at all. As always, the ingredient list is fire, but this doesn’t succeed as a moisturizer for me. It’s a pretty cost-effective serum, though!\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\n5/5\n\nThis is an all-time great. They struck gold with this formulation, and I hope they never stop making it. I have bought at least 15 of these, and considering how much I like to try new things, something becoming a staple means something haha. I would describe this as a goopy occlusive containing almost no occlusives that somehow just works. If you use it as your final step, your skin will be well protected and wake up so hydrated. If you want to use it as a serum, it absolutely smashes all other hydrating serums and you only need a little. I will alternate between both using it as a serum and an occlusive depending on the weather. One drawback is that it is so THICK that you do need to melt it down in your hands sometimes depending on how much you’re using. \n\nIsntree’s Chestnut PHA Clear Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother fantastic product that is actually super new. They used to have a PHA sleeping mask that caught them in hot water because it had some fragrant extract (lol), but this updated version adds chestnut extract and removes any fragrance. According to their insta, they wanted this to be more of a daily moisturizer akin to the onion and c-niacin creams, and I’d say they mostly succeeded in doing this. The ingredient list is another humble brag, and I’d say overall this has helped me so much with daily usage. The benefits of getting minor exfoliation every single day kind of speak for themselves. I will say that this doesn’t dry down as well as their other daily moisturizers, but I would just use less of it if this bothers you. I also find it doesn’t “lock in” as well as some moisturizers do, but having a PHA 5% gel cream is just too useful for me to not love it.\n\nIsntree’s Mugwort Spot Gel Cream\n\n4/5\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I find it suspicious that this doesn’t smell like mugwort even a little bit. I could add a drop of One Thing’s Mugwort toner and make this thing so fragrant, so I am just a bit confused there haha. This is very, very similar to the onion and c-niacin creams in the way that it locks in everything really well and dries down quickly. It doesn’t have Niacinamide, which is a bit of a drawback overall to me, but if you are one of the B3 haters out there, then this would be the one for you. It does a great job at reducing redness and was a great medicinal treatment of a burn I got recently. I’d recommend this cream up and down, but it is typically just a bit too expensive for what it is.\n\nIsntree’s Yam Root Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a unique product in their line as it is their only moisturizer outside of the HA sleeping mask that aims to be heavy. It has 57% yam root extract with a bunch of other great, soothing/brightening extracts like rice, soybean, and oat. It also has 5 ceramides and cholesterol, which isn’t a common feature for them. This does dry down pretty well, but not nearly as well as the others, seemingly by design. It applies like a luxury cream and was so similar to Then I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream that I just put the rest of the cream in that packaging and mixed it with hemi-squalane to provide even more moisture. This is their best moisturizer for people with dry skin IMO\n\niUNIK’s Propolis Vitamin Sleeping Mask\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love the concept of this cream - both propolis and sea buckthorn joined together. It’s like a trip through the superfoods section of your local supplement shop. This does have niacinamide, but at a probably lower concentration than the other ones above (though who really knows? lol). This one is significant to me because it very firmly locks in everything before it and dries down pretty quickly to a dewy finish. I don’t think it’s the best sleeping mask in the world, but it’s a great daily moisturizer. \n\niUNIK’s Beta Glucan Daily Moisture Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nY’all already know I love beta glucan, but this cream is the exact same consistency as the HA Moist Cream from Isntree. It is more of a serum for me than a moisturizer. I still loved it in this capacity, but I find their beta glucan serum to be a much better option and just a bit more expensive.\n\niUNIK’s Centella Calming Gel Cream\n\n1/5\n\nThis isn’t even a cream at all, which makes me laugh a little bit. It would make a really watery serum, too. It is a bit fragrant and is essentially an overpriced cica gel. I’d just get Isntree’s Aloe options if you’re looking into this one. I don’t really understand how this is sold as a facial cream.\n\nIlliyoon’s Ceramide ATO Concentrate Cream\n\n3.75/5\n\nThis is of course an HG, but it is a bit drying for winter temps because of the dimethicone/hydrogenated lecithin. Since this dries down while just sitting on your face, it makes your face somehow dry to the touch AND super waxy. The benefits speak for themselves, and it has helped me through some difficult skin eras, but my time of using it has passed. I also think the ceramide beads are a neat trick that does help deliver those ingredients freshly to your skin, they make the product into a bit of a scrub. My skin is sensitive to rubbing/friction over really anything else, so applying this to compromised skin always made me worried even though it helped in the end haha. \n\nIlliyoon’s Ceramide ATO Soothing Gel Cream\n\n4.75/5\n\nImagine if you took what I liked about the Isntree daily moisturizers and reduced it down to the most basic possible ingredient list. This gets docked for only having .05% ceramides, but I don’t really care to be honest. In the world where I stop feeling like trying something new every day, this is what I would choose as my everyday moisturizer and my nightly gel cream as I prefer basic formulations. This is never my final step, but if it is, it will leave your skin looking a bit wet/glassy for a while. It’s somehow dry to the touch during this stage, but a lot of people wouldn’t really love that.\n\nCOSRx’s Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream\n\n4/5\n\nIf this came in a tube, I would be giving it a perfect rating, and would actually purchase and use it regularly. The smell is *heavenly*, the consistency is so delightfully goopy, and it goes on like a luxury gel cream. COSRx is legit WILD for making a bunch of creams and somehow ONLY putting their goopy creams in tubs - it’s genuinely illogical. It’s why I’ve never purchased the snail cream - like why would I? lol This also leaves a pretty oily film on your skin after, but I don’t even care. I just love the texture - if I’m ever rich I am going to buy this in bulk and bathe in it.\n\nCOSRx’s Balancium D-panthenol Cream\n\n4/5\n\nThis has silicone and dimethicone, so it does dry down super quickly. It is the only cream of theirs that I’d feel comfortable using as my final step, though, and I find it to be more than enough at night. The drying down aspect makes it a fantastic daily moisturizer, as well. Purito’s 10% is a bit better, but this one would function better as a daily moisturizer. I do like this as it helps firm and even out redness, but I wouldn’t repurchase it unless it was on a good sale.\n\nCOSRx’s Rice Spa Overnight Mask\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis isn’t a sleeping mask, and yes I am docking it for this. This is the same consistency as the Isntree HA Moist Cream/iUNIK Beta Glucan Cream and this one is just egregious because it’s a sleeping mask. It is somehow, at the same time, quite oily looking after. I would compare it to Illiyoon’s ATO Lotion (not reviewed here) in the way that it’s not nearly enough to be a moisturizer while somehow never sinking in and clogging pores lol. I know a lot of people love this one, but it wasn’t for me. I ended up using it on my body.\n\nCOSRx’s Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nI really didn’t like this one - it was this gross waxy texture because they went for a “matte balm” texture. This is achieved by making a SUPER emollient cream and adding dimethicone, trimethicone, and hydrogenated lecithin. I am assuming they are trying to duplicate the Ceramidin smell with the bergamot, but this is somehow way more fragrant than anything I’ve used from Dr. Jart (SOMEHOW). It is to me a bit of a formulational failure, so I wouldn’t recommend it; but I am sure this is many people’s holy grail. YMMV\n\nCOSRx’s Propolis Overnight Mask\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother serum! This one does work as a sleeping mask, but it is a very liquidy texture for such an impressive gel cream. This is one of my favorite CosRx products because it’s basically just propolis goop. If you want to use it as a sleeping mask, your face has to be completely dried down or else it will apply like a serum. I ended up not using it very often, so I added it to my One Thing Mugwort Toner and made a super viscous and frothy toner. I call it Iced Tea.\n\nCOSRx’s Cica Pure Fit Cream\n\n2/5\n\nI experienced no lift on my redness with this, and it dries down to the point where it takes away more than it adds. It has a beautifully thick and creamy texture that goes nowhere once applied. I ended up using this on my body because of the dryness it caused on my face, but this would be a decent daily cream for people as long as it goes under a sunscreen. I used this as a sleeping mask once and my skin was so dry the next day - wouldn’t recommend it at all for that.\n\nRound Lab’s Pine Cream\n\n3.75/5\n\nAyyyyyyyy another serum I actually like. This doesn’t do anything as far as locking in moisture goes, but it’s an awesome antioxidant-based hydrating serum. It has LHA, which is meant to help with evening out your skin tone. I found this was an excellent hydration and glow booster, but it really did help even out my tone. I am a big fan of this one, but considering it isn’t a great moisturizer, I’ll just spring for the serum next time.\n\n9Wishes Pine Cream\n\n1/5\n\nThis, just like Round Lab’s cream, was more of a serum than anything else. It lightly burned on contact (like CeraVe or Paula’s Choice moisturizers) and has terrible pump packaging that makes it super difficult to get the product out. I love the sunscreen and the toner from this line (both perfect 5/5’s), so this was a huge disappointment for me.\n\nApieu’s Madecassoside Gel Cream\n\n5/5\n\nI am surprised I haven’t repurchased this as I was a massive fan. It was scentless to me, which is an experience I haven’t had with any other A'pieu product. It does dry down really well while sealing in everything very well - this is a cream that perfectly strikes the balance for me. It is not so drying that it takes away moisture like some of the creams above, but it’s a great priming moisturizer before sunscreen or makeup. \n\nApieu’s Madecassoside Moisture Gel Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nIn terms of texture, this is a cream that is directly comparable to Isntree’s Onion Newpair cream for me. Hydrating, moisturizing, and dries down quickly - it’s just blue instead of purple. It does have dimethicone, but I only hold certain ingredients against the product if it seems to do the thing I hate LOL - this isn’t drying and it doesn’t just sit there. It is also quite fragrant, which I wasn’t a fan of. \n\nThen I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream:\n\n5/5\n\nThis is the best cream I have ever used, and it makes me so sad because it’s $54. I compared the Yam Root Moisturizer to this, but in reality this has a much more luxurious texture. Imagine if you took an expensive Asian ginseng-based anti-aging cream, removed all the bad ingredients, and put it in beautiful periwinkle packaging. You’d have this. It doesn’t dry down quickly at all, but it’s not heavy - just very emollient. It is an amazing night cream, and I would love it so much more if it came in a tube.",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

That's just me tho :) The Cosrx is definitely weaker, but suitable for those with very sensitive skin who needs very slow exfoliation.   \n\n\n**QUESTION TIME!** \n\nDoes anyone know anything about JainaFace? How legit is this brand?   \nI have their 10% Glycolic Acid that doesn't even tingle on my face and seems to do nothing at all. Meanwhile, Cosrx AHA liquid, that has a lower percentage of free acid even, tingles. I suspect this brand to be a hoax but I'm not sure. Their 2% salicylic acid doesnt' really do anything for me either *(and I have spent 12 months testing out salicylic acids)*.  Same with a friend, she says she tried some products *(HA and some vitamin C stuff)* but that it didn't do anything for her face at all.   \nI contacted JainaFace a couple of months back to ask **1**. why they are allowed to use 2% salicylic acid in their products when the limit is 0.5% in Korea, and **2**. why there is next to zero information about this brand.  \nThe person who answered was nice enough but I find it shady that they don't want to market themselves... They claimed they would have to think about it, if it was true that people were starting to think they repackage and sell an American product, or that their products are generally fake/Chinese.  \nNothing's really happened except I saw they made a reddit account and posted a statement in  a reddit thread that they're not fake :P",

    "body": "Biggest contributor to my skin one year ago was the fact that I was addicted to heroin. I was constantly scratching my skin and physically exfoliating because it makes you itch like crazy. Once I started recovery I got really into skincare but finding the right products for my skin was so hard. I have super sensitive combination skin. I reacted badly to almost every product | tried, either directly after applying or it would make me break out after 1-2 days. I wasted so much money on skincare items but at least it wasn't for nothing because I finally have a routine that my skin loves! :)\n\nStep one: Avene xeracalm oil cleanser\n\nStep two: Isana ultra sensitive calming serum\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Polyglycery -6 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Coco-Caprylate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Oenothera Biennis Oil, Panthenol, Ethylhexy|glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Pantolactone\n\nRight now it's still hot where I live so it's hydrating enough but when it gets colder I use vaseline at night to look in the moisture.\n\nI also use tea tree oil as spot treatment for pimpler & Salicylic acid to exfoliate when I can tell mys v needs it (less than once a week, even that was tu-much for my sensitive skin, it caused break outs)\n\nI do also use sunscreen but I haven't found the right one yet. If someone with similar skin problems has any advice l'd appreciate it!",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

A lot of skincare is based on “it *should * work” theoretically, but unless it’s tested with real outside factors (not done only in a lab) like does it penetrate the skin, does it work on skin pH, does it work with other products, and many other factors, I wouldn’t trust claims like increasing collagen production. I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today. Keep in mind, none of the dupes listed will have the exact same formulation as Skinceuticals due to the patent. Below are some popular dupes and the differences it has with Skinceuticals.\n\n**Paula's Choice C15 Booster**\n\n[Link](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html)\n\nPrice: \\~$65/oz\n\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this product.\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Paula's Choice C15 Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water (Aqua), Ascorbic Acid, Butylene|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerin,|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Castor Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Tocopherol,|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Norleucine Acetate, Lecithin, Ferulic|\n||Acid, Panthenol, Bisabolol, Oryza Sativa|\n||(Rice) Bran Extract, Propyl Gallate,|\n||Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide,|\n||Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.|\n\nPaulas's Choice claims that this a **15% Vitamin C formula, 1% Vitamin E,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid** at pH of **3.1**.

NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "So, admission: I am OBSESSED with celebrity videos showing them doing and/or undoing their skincare and make-up. \n\nVogue's Get Ready With Me series and it's international versions (so far I know of: Mexico, Spain, Japan, France), Harper Bazaar's  Go To Bed With Me series, Allure's 10 Minute Beauty Routine, etc.\n\nAs long as it features someone who I would consider a celebrity, and that to me leaves out influencers that sometimes get featured in any of those series, I'm all up on it.\n\nI'm also a skincare fanatic and have been one even before I discovered the skincare communities online, which I promise isn't a brag. I've suffered from very bad acne since my teenage years and it hasn't been until recently, when I finally got a job with insurance and could finally see a dermatologist, that I got that under control. So I've got plenty of years reading about what over the counter stuff could work, and fantasizing about having money to purchase stuff promoted by celebrities so I could have \"Hollywood\" skin. I'm looking at you, Proactiv. But I digress. Sorta.\n\nAnyway, I can say I've probably watched every single video in both the Vogue and Harper Bazaar's series, which I feel are the more \"revealing\" of what is available, and I thought this community would be interested in \\~what I've learned\\~ from this very productive addiction of mine in regards to celebrity culture and the world of skincare. Hear me out:\n\n1. First, let me be honest: **most celebrities are lucky to be blessed,** ***genetically*****, with what is considered good skin.** There are exceptions, of course, and fame does also grant them access to treatments to help keep their skin looking good but even without that, it seems that most of the celebs who have appeared w/o makeup in these videos just have good skin.\n\n2. A common belief about these videos is that **celebrities do them when they have something to promote, namely a makeup and/or skincare brand**. There are some videos where this is very obviously the case ([Rihanna's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KONe4SNFA64&t=277s), [Kendall Jenner's first GRWM video when she was an Estee Lauder ambassador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfmXkhBieXA), [Kerry Washington's Neutrogena fest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPwLou93-X4)), but a lot of them seem to be less obviously a commercial promoting a brand and feature only one or two products that a celebrity is either promoting because, well, they own the brand or because they are from a brand that is well known to gift their stuff to celebs (more on this in less than a second...\n\n3. I feel this goes without saying for most that devour these videos like I do **but there are certain** **~~insanely overpriced~~** **high-end brands that pop-up VERY frequently and it seems very obvious that these brands are reaching out to celebrities with their products** \\- so they are essentially given some very expensive freebies in exchange of some PR, y'all know the deal. The three culprits, for what I've seen, are:\n\n*-Dr. Barbara Sturm***:** So I can't afford her shit so I can't give you proper reviews but my understanding is that her products are fine. Inoffensive, just extremely overpriced for formulations that are not any special. The serum that is often used by celebrities is her Hyaluronic Acid which is a whooping $110! In contract, The Ordinary has a HA serum that runs for $6.80.\n\nOh, also Dr. Strum isn't a dermatologist. She is an orthopedic surgeon-turned-skin-specialist, like Hyram I guess? Also, she doesn't wear sunscreen. Tell that to an actual dermatologist and tell me what they think!\n\n\\-*Augustinus Bader:* So if I can't afford Sturm, I sure as hell cannot afford Augustinus Bader. Not gonna lie, I'm a sucker for packaging so I'd be all over this brand if I could. I actually don't know a lot about this brand but reading the ingredients of *The Cream*, which is the products from this brand I see most often in these videos, it's a fine moisturizer with some form of retinol ad vitamin C plus soothing and moisturizing ingredients like panthenol, shea butter and aloe vera. Lovely ingredients but you can definitely find a product with them from less than the $250 *The Cream* runs you. Don't have much information other that **WOAH EXPENSIVE**, I'm afraid. But it's obvious that Mr. Bader has been sending this out to literally ANYONE, from the A+ list to anyone with more than 100k followers on instagram and a line of dialogue on a CW show.\n\n\\-*La Mer*:  of course we must mention La Mer! Please correct me if I'm wrong but I believe Kim K popularized La Mer? The $360 Creme de la Mer is the products from this brand you'll probably see featured. So it's definitely a splurge. Rumor in the skincare community is that the formulation for this moisturizer is identical to the German Nivea cream but I can't neither confirm nor deny this since this type of moisturizer is too thick for my acne prone skin. But anyway, the La Mer game is unmatched. I've personally seen it surge in popularity in the world of Korean entertainment, when a year ago it was a brand with zero name brand recognition in the country with a sudden increase in popularity after seeing celebrities and influencers incorporate it in their skincare. \n\nSomeone far smarter than me can probably make this point better than I can about how showing off these brands as part of your daily routine is a way of making a statement about status but, yeah, it's interesting to see how these brands pop up in the hands of both A-listers and D-listers.\n\n4. You know the new money vs. old money comparison that I think maybe originated in The Great Gatsby? ~~I may be 100 percent wrong so feel free to correct me~~. But in essence how those that come from a long line of family wealth compared to whose who have recently come into money and how the former look down upon the latter? From my very limited perspective, these videos sorta give us a window into seeing these two different worlds that make up Hollywood. Why, you ask? Well, honestly, this view of mine was cemented when I watched [Tracee Ellis Ross's Vogue video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GsK5feFt1U&t=295s). She was featured showing her hair routine, which was used to mainly promote her haircare brand. However, it was the skincare part that caught my attention. You see, literally a few days before this video was posted I had learned that she attended a Swiss boarding school and, upon learning this, I remember being \"oh well DUH she's Diana Ross's daughter, that's Hollywood royalty\" and her skincare routine certainly screamed some type of royalty for sure: no Sturm or La Mer, that's for flexing on the 'gram, but *Biologique Recherche*. *Yon-Ka*. *Retrouve*. That's some seriously luxury items - for *Biologique Recherche,* for example, most websites that sell their products ask you two login to see the price! Her routine contains various items from this brand and just the moisturizer runs for $600. \n\nAnother celebrity who I would consider \"Hollywood royalty\" who made a video with Vogue is Zoe Kravitz, so of course I was perched to see what products she would be using. Lo and behold, there's *Retrouve* again! Their face serum, which is essentially a vitamin C serum, cost you just $325 while the eye cream Zoe uses is $415. \n\nOther super luxury brands of the same caliber, in the opinion of this consumer of celebrity culture who currently has $40 in her bank account, are: Cle de Peau, Sisley, Guerlain (Angelina Jolie has [their oil in her bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF4_Wq4EDp4)!), Valmont, La Prairie, and even some Dior skincare. ~~Am I missing any?~~\n\nAnyway, I guess the point I'm trying to make is that there are certain luxury brands that seem to be associated with \"new rich\" and thus are more accessible (literally being gifted to everyone with a modicum of fame) and some even more luxurious brands that are more exclusive and the favorites of the established Hollywood elite. To me, somehow it feels like I can strive to buy one Creme de la Mer but that Biologique Recherche serum? Not in this life!\n\nI really hope I made some sense and please feel free to tell me if I'm missing any brands either of the new rich or old rich sort!\n\n**5. Celebrities spends $$$ on anti-aging serums and skincare items but really don't care to use enough SPF** \\- the one skincare item that all dermatologists and skin care specialists alike agree is the key to preventing wrinkles and sun spots aka aging gracefully. Anyway, this of course came to a light with the [Gwyneth Paltrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIUO1GurifU&t=284s) now infamous video but don't let her get all the attention! These celebs smother themselves on every single super expensive product and then apply a dab of sunscreen!\n\n6. **Ultimately: Cetaphil is THAT bitch.** No, I'm not being sponsored by Cetaphil. But after keeping track of products used again and again by different celebrities, and them mainly being of the Sturm-Bader-LaMer trifecta, it was interesting to see Cetaphil reign as the most popular cleanser by far. [Some products are just that good that you'll have Megan Thee Stallion using them alongside her Creme de la Mer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6C0q1Z9pGA&t=295s). Vaseline is another affordable favorite of celebrities.\n\n**7.** **The most used foundation in these videos, per my very unscientific recollection:** Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation.\n\n...and that's it! I feel like I had much more to say but after all the typing I'm drawing a blank. Anyway, I know there's others out there with the same ~~obsession~~ fondness with these videos as me, so I'm curious as to what you guys think? Is there anything else you've noticed yourself?\n\n**Also, bonus questions: what celebrities skincare/makeup secrets are you dying to know?**\n\nBecause I'm nosy as hell, I'm dying to know about Beyonce and Taylor Swift's skincare favorites. I'm not a mega fan of either but they are just so, well, massive that I'm always curious what someone that famous is putting on their face.\n\nAlso because I think they are hot: Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Alicia Vikander, Rooney Mara, Tessa Thompson and Kristen Stewart.",

        "body": "Interesting post. Even though I'm a fellow skincare addict, I have to say I don't watch these videos too much because they all feel like soft advertising and they all feel a bit same-same after a while. A few points to add:\n\n* Biologic Recherche is indeed pricey, but actually not that jaw-droppingly expensive. [Liberty has most of their products listed on their website](https://www.libertylondon.com/uk/brands/b/biologique-recherche/) and you don't need two logins to view them if you're curious. Some say the Pixi Glow Tonic is a dupe of P50 (and the Ordinary glycolic acid toning solution is the dupe for Glow Tonic). I don't think they're straight dupes, but I think the Glow Tonic works perfectly fine at that price point.\n* Kim K may use La Mer, but I don't think she was the one who popularised it. La Mer has always featured *heavily* in woman's magazines in as early as the 90s. Estee Lauder acquired the brand in the mid-90s and invested heavily in marketing 'the cream'. You basically can't pick up a copy of In Style/Marie Clare/Cosmo/Vogue without somebody name-dropping La Mer. (That and the pink-and-green Mabylline mascara.)\n* One reason you may see Cetaphil a lot is because it's manufactured by Galderma, which also makes Restylane, Dysport (botox) and other aesthetic products. Personally don't think Cetaphil is all that special. It's a *basic* inoffensive cleanser and skincare nerds will tell you there are better cleansers out there. But Galderma does a lot of direct promotion to healthcare professionals and I can see a dermatologist just defaults to recommending Cetaphil because of brand recall. It's like 8 out of 10 dentist recommends Colgate/Oral-B/whatever.",

It was an absolute splurge, but I was completely led by the hype, and all these beautiful people with beautiful skin speaking of it like the some mystical holy grail.\n\nI bought it and followed the directions Augustinius Bader recommends—almost. They want you to stop using everything but their cream for 28 days, as that is, ostensibly, the duration of your skin’s turnover cycle. Well I’m on prescription Tretinoin and I wasn’t about to break that usage because of its importance to my skin and the break-in phase, etc., but I did discontinue the use of everything else. And I am both incredibly disappointed and also happy (for my bank account’s sake) to say...that shit is nothing special. Very, very expensive nothing special. In fact, I found it to not be moisturizing enough, and my skin often felt tight. So when I emptied the bottle I glared at it and tossed it into the recycling bin as a very costly experiment that had failed.\n\nSo that’s just my two cents to add to this discussion. Save your money! There are cheaper, better products out there, imo.\n\nETA: There is a negligible amount of retinoid listed as an ingredient in The Cream, so I’m aware that could’ve potentially been messing with my Tret as an irritant and a reason it didn’t work for me. But as it’s a low dosage and the rest of the experience sucked anyway, I personally don’t think so but of course, YMMV.",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products.

I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether.

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "I have been in kbeauty industry for a while and one of the most interesting parts of the K-beauty wave is that there is quic a big difference between in Korea and other countries in terms of beauty trend.\n\nFor example, those brands all K-beauty junkies definitely know like Cosrx and dear Klair's are not really famous or well known in Korea.\n\nOn the other hand, those brands picking up really quick in Korea are not much introduced to other countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I like reading content in this community, I like to contribute to the community by introducing those newly rising brands and products in Korea.\n\nI'm not sure how often I can keep this posts up but will try my very best to upload biweely or monthly at least.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I have chosen the products below by outstanding keyword ranks of beauty category on [naver.com](https://naver.com), the biggiest local-dominating portal service in Korea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[Goodal\\] green tangerine vita C dark spot serum 30ml**   \n\\- Price: KRW 19,200 - USD 16.16  \n\\- Manufacturer: Cosmax  \nIt has been chosen the most popular serum in Korea for about 2 years since 2018 and I believe it's one of the bestsellers of all Kbeauty items in the world.  \nThis contains 70% of Jeju green tangerine extract which helps firm and vitalize skin.  \nIt also claims it cares dry and irritated skin gently, but it may sting at the beginning because of the vitamin C ingredient.  \nThere are lovers or haters, not many in between. Personally I don't really like it as it doesn't really work on my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[d'Alba\\] first spray serum 100ml**  \n\\- Price: KRW 26,100 - USD 21.97  \n\\- Manufacturer: BNB Korea  \nIt has gained more and more awareness since last year in Korea known as a 'Flight attendant mist'.  \nIt contains Avocado oil, white truffle, and 3 vegetable essential oil to provide good ratio of water and oil balance.  \nI found some reviews of it on Aamzon which are mostly pretty good, this may be a new try for you if you have such dry skin and use mist constantly.  \nI haven't used it so can't comment on the item, but personally don't like such pet name \"stewardess cosmetics\", this gives very weird feeling to me all the time..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[Round Lab\\] 1025 Dokdo toner 200ml**   \n\\- Price: KRW 13,500 - USD 11.36  \n\\- Manufacturer: Cosmax  \nThis hypoallergenic toner has been one of the most popular cleansing toner in Korea since 2017.  \nThe water is from deep sea with full of mineral and it contains panthenol to gently hydrate skin.  \nIt has such a patriotic name in it (Dokdo) and this may give a better impression to Koreans.  \nI like it as a daily cleansing toner thanks to its very light and hypoallergenic formula and reasonable price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[Anua\\] heartleaf soothing Toner 250ml**  \n\\- Price: KRW 20,000 - USD 16.77  \n\\- Manufacturer: Megacos  \nIt contains 77% of Houttuynia extract that is known for soothing and calming skin gently.  \nAnua is a pretty new brand but it has been seen at many places both on/offline, the brand provides hypoallergenic products with relatively less numberes of ingredients.  \nI haven't used it yet so can't comment on its quality, but there are quite many organic reviews with good comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[Tonymoly\\] ceramide mocchi toner 500ml**  \n\\- Price: KRW 9,900 - USD 8.30  \n\\- Manufacturer: Megacos  \nThanks to its big volume at a very good price, the makeup brand's ceramide toner has been popular especially among 10/20's.  \nIt contains 5,000ppb ceramide that helps prevent evaporation of moisture in skin.  \nThe color of content is white so it seems quite viscous but it is not really, it can be used as a skin mist as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[CNP Laboratory\\] propolis energy ampoule 35ml**  \n\\- Price: KRW 25,000 - USD 20.96  \n\\- Manufacturer: Skin & Skin  \nThis very popular propolis ampoule has been ranked highly for over few years, this is one of the best selling items at O'live Young as well.  \nIt's well known as it hydrates and nourishes skin very well while evening skin as well.  \nIt's not sticky but not very light, so it's good for dry skin type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[Zeroid\\] soothing cream 80ml**  \n\\- Price: about KRW 27,000 - USD 22.64  \n\\- Manufacturer: Neopharm  \nThis amazing soothing cream has been the first choice of dermatologists in Korea to genly care such sensitive skin (One of my friends who are dermatologist with atopic skin has used this cream for over 5 years).  \nSince Zeroid is not available at normal retail shops like olive young, not that many people have used it but every person I know who tried this loves it.  \nI do like this cream as well, this is very light yet moisturizing very smoothly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[Torriden\\] DIVE-IN serum 50ml**  \n\\- Price: KRW 18,000 - USD 15.09  \n\\- Manufacturer: Celleco  \nIt is known as a hypoallergenic serum with many blog reviews.  \nThis serum is not viscous, so this can be used as a moisturizing toner for those who use toner as a cleansing and evening product.  \nIf you are not really a person who has such dry skin and needs highly moisturizing skin care routine, this may be your daily serum (despite its lower volume).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[MIGUHARA\\] ultra whitening ample 20ml**  \n\\- Price: KRW 9,900-31,200 - USD 8.30-26.16  \n\\- Manufacturer: Charming Cosmetics  \nAlthough it is a well known brand among 20's, the vitamin C ampoule has been widely purchased through TV shopping with massive discount.  \nSince I have not tried it yet and there are not that many organic reviews so can't comment much (found some good reviews on Amazon though).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **\\[Mealade\\] fermented rice brightening essence 150ml**  \n\\- Price: KRW 10,000-18,000 - USD 8.39-15.09  \n\\- Manufacturer: Korea Research Institute of Bio Science (KRIBS)  \nThis is not that much popular in Korea yet but I think this is pretty good daily hydrating essence.  \nIt contains 95% of fermented rice extract and galactomyces filtrate, quite viscous but very lightweight.  \nI have used it for about 3 months and very satisfied as it hydrates very well, but it doesn't really work as a brightener to me.  \nBad thing about it is how to buy: it is available on some online malls but the price varies quite much. I think this is a typical problem of some Korean beauty brands because of messy distribution structure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, this takes quite long time for me to summarize the 9 products above, now I am not that confident to keep this up.. will try my best :)",

The brands most accessible for most of us to research and try are pretty much limited to the brands available to us on specific online retailers/distributors - so we are somewhat at the mercy of whatever brands make deals with Yesstyle, Jolse, etc. to distribute to the western market.\n\nProducts that aren't so accessible sometimes pop up on Amazon (but often don't have good english descriptions, ingredient lists, or many reviews, if any!) or can be found in brick-and-mortar k-beauty shops if you are lucky to live in cities with big asian populations. But for someone who doesn't speak or read korean, having someone else's recommendations would probably be necessary for me to try that product out. You really have to know exactly what you are looking for.  \n\n\nI wonder if this gap will close as k-beauty becomes more global - or if there will be a new rising market niche of \"western k-beauty\" lol",

I’ve been using panoxyl 4% every night and any light facial wash in the morning(i used cerave). I also used head and shoulders shampoo(yes, shampoo also affects your skin) and if you use conditioner make sure you rinse it off before you wash your body and face. Also try to avoid fried food and gluten. Wash your sheets and pillow case weekly. Change towels every 3 days if possible use disposable towels or silk pillowcase. Hope this can help you as well.

There's ample emphasis on soothing and repairing ingredients such as ceramides,  mugwort, cica and propolis for the finalists as well, in large part due to the prevalence of maskne.*\n\n# TREND\n\n\\#**Kombucha**\n\n* [T'else Teatox Kombucha Essence](https://glowpick.com/product/125407)\n\n**#Retinol**\n\n* [Iope Retinol Expert 0.1%](https://glowpick.com/product/128764)\n\n**#Biome**\n\n* [Dr Jart Vital Hydra Solution Biome Essence](https://glowpick.com/product/121678)\n\n**#Probiotics**\n\n* [Illiyoon Probiotics Skin Barrier Essence Drop](https://glowpick.com/product/108147)\n\n**#Trouble Care**\n\n* [Papa Recipe Madecare Ointment](https://glowpick.com/product/93654)\n\n**#Soothing Care**\n\n* [Botanic Heal Derma Intensive Cica Panthenol Blemish Cream](https://glowpick.com/product/124602)\n\n**#Mask-proof**\n\n* [Make Up For Ever Matte Velvet Skin Blurring Powder Foundation](https://glowpick.com/product/109394)\n\n**#Foundation-free**\n\n* [Banila Co It Radiant CC Cream SPF30 PA++](https://glowpick.com/product/99545)\n\n**#Small Luxury**\n\n* [Dior Miss Dior Hair Mist](https://glowpick.com/product/33473)\n\n**#Clean Beauty**\n\n* [One Thing Houttuynia Cordata Extract](https://glowpick.com/product/122603)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Next up, we have the products that made a splash with their debut in 2020 aka the* **rookies**. ^(ft. some renewals)\n\n# ROOKIE\n\n**Skin/Toner**\n\n* [Bring Green Tea Tree Cica Soothing Toner](https://glowpick.com/product/135617)\n* [Rootree Purifying Cream Toner](https://glowpick.com/product/139298)\n* [Welskin Centella Cotton Toner Pads](https://glowpick.com/product/134094)\n\n**Essence/Serum**\n\n* [Nature Republic Hyalon Active 10 Blue Capsule Serum](https://glowpick.com/product/136515)\n* [Hanyul Pink Plum Vinegar Resetting Essence](https://glowpick.com/product/133789)\n* [Mixsoon Centella Water Essence](https://glowpick.com/product/138533)\n* [Mixsoon Galactomyces Essence](https://glowpick.com/product/138536)\n* [Innisfree Black Tea Youth Enhancing Ampoule](https://glowpick.com/product/139508)\n\n**Cream**\n\n* [Hanyul Pure Artemisia Calming Water Cream](https://glowpick.com/product/132822)\n* [A'pieu Madecassoside Moisture Gel Cream](https://glowpick.com/product/135158)\n* [Eucerin Urea Repair Cream](https://glowpick.com/product/130337)\n* [Logically Skin Wrinkle Target Eye Cream](https://glowpick.com/product/135555)\n* [Missha Atelocollagen 500 Power Plumping Cream](https://glowpick.com/product/139770)\n\n**Facial Cleanser**\n\n* [Hanyul Pure Artemisia Calming Foam Cleanser](https://glowpick.com/product/136510)\n* [Neutrogena Labs Hydrating Micellar Gel Cleanser](https://glowpick.com/product/131399)\n\n**Makeup Cleanser**\n\n* [Preppeau Pond's Make Up Fit Daily Deep Cleanser](https://glowpick.com/product/138185)\n* [Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Cleansing Oil Pad](https://glowpick.com/product/139432)\n\n**Exfoliation**\n\n* [Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Peeling Pad Toner](https://glowpick.com/product/137860)\n\n**Foundation**\n\n* [Giverny Milchak Cover Foundation SPF30 PA++](https://glowpick.com/product/131325)\n* [Laneige Neo Cushion Matte SPF40 PA++](https://glowpick.com/product/135152)\n\n**Concealer**\n\n* [The Saem Studio Concealer SPF30+ PA++](https://glowpick.com/product/135142)\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\n* [Xaiel Fine Sun CC SPF50+/PA++++](https://glowpick.com/product/136974) ^(Cosmecca)\n* [Keep Cool Soothe Sun Essence SPF50+/PA++++](https://glowpick.com/product/136033) ^(Greencos/Adaline)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*And now... the* **winners** *of this year's selection!*\n\n# FINALISTS\n\n**SKIN/TONER**\n\n* ***Watery Toner***\n\n1.

    "body": "Hi guys. This is basically satire but could I get your opinion on this morning hygiene ritual from American Psycho?\n\n> I pour some Plax antiplaque formula into a stainless-steel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds. Then I squeeze Rembrandt onto a faux-tortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth (too hung over to floss properly - but maybe I flossed before bed last night?) and rinse with Listerine. Then I inspect my hands and use a nailbrush. I take the ice-pack mask off and use a deep-pore cleanser lotion, then an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I check my toenails. Then I use the Probright tooth polisher and next the Interplak tooth polisher (this in addition to the toothbrush) which has a speed of 4200 rpm and reverses direction forty-six times per second; the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces. \n\n>I rinse again, with Cepacol. I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub. The shower has a universal all-directional shower head that adjusts within a thirty-inch vertical range. It's made from Australian gold-black brass and covered with a white enamel finish. In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older. The conditioner is also good - silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older. \n\n>On weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs. Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale's or Bergdorf's and on Evelyn's advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation. \n\n>Once out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it - preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers - which I've found makes removing the hair easier. It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade. Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows, pressing gently on the skin. Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. \n\n>One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin. Applying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture. Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky - which makes it look dull and older - use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker). Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing “protective” lotion. A scalp-programming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural-bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb.\n\n",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

        "body": "Please do dermatology.... or fuck it both!! There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "**TRETINOIN ADVICE**\n\nSome tips from my personal experience with Tretinoin Microsphere. \n\n1. Introduce Tretinoin during winter. (Tretinoin takes the top layer off, which protects us from the sun)\n1. Climatise your skin with retinol before you start on Tretinoin.\n1. Use a mild cleanser, wash your face gently. \n1. Avoid wash cloth, facial scrubs, astringents or any product that will irritate the skin eg actives like LAA, AHA, BHA.\n1. Do not apply immediately after washing your face. Wait 20minutes \n1. The face must be cleansed and completely dry in order for Tretinoin to work properly.  Having water on the surface of your face will prevent it from settling properly.\n1. You may mix Tretinoin with other skin serums if you are experiencing sensitivity.\n1. Start low (eg 0.025) to ensure your skin can adapt to its effects. Building your tolerance will create better results. Before you go to the next level, make sure you use up at least 1 whole tube and have no more redness/peeling before you get a stronger dosage.\n1. Try to use the Tretinoin every night even if you need to dilute it. Using it daily helps you to acclimate better and faster to it. If i stop for a week, it takes me a couple of weeks to get acclimatised to Tretinoin again.\n1. Apply a pea size of Tretinoin to your forehead , cheeks, nose & chin. You may want to avoid applying to sensitive areas like the corners of your mouth, eyes and nose. \n1. No need to use more than pea sized, Dr Frances Prenna Jones teaches how to use a \"chickpea\" size on this [video](https://youtu.be/RMHG3K5x_WE), fast forward to 16:23. She says \"MORE is not MORE\" lol\n1. Begin by applying every other night. After 2 weeks, if there is no redness or irritation, increase application to every night. If you develop redness or irritation, continue at every other night or decrease to twice weekly.\n1. After applying tretinoin, practise wait time of 20min-1 hour before applying your other serums/moisturisers for maximum benefits from Tretinoin.  \n1. When reintroducing Tretinoin into your routine after a long break or perhaps for the Tretinoin virgins, use your AHA/BHA in the day and Tretinoin at night. If you use both together, it may be too irritating for the skin.\n1. Gel is more potent than cream version. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pigmentation/comments/5acyqx/tretinoin_retinol_retina_differin_adapalene/d9o4wyy/)\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol  could give you a red, rosy hue to the skin as Retinoic acid increases capillary aborisation in the dermis. You may want to get a colour correcting primer to use before you apply your foundation. It could either be green/yellow based.\n1. Apply Tretinoin in the night only. No exceptions. Do not use in the day. Tretinoin is light sensitive.\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol will increase your photosensitivity, sunscreen is mandatory. Do not start Tretinoin if you do not intend to use sunscreen.\n1. Please use a mineral based sunscreen and wear a broad rim hat. Mineral based sunscreen will better block the sun harmful rays and are less likely to irritate the skin unlike sunscreen chemicals. Lack of sun protection can lead to easily burned skin.\n1. Less is more with Tretinoin.\n1. Continued use is key, as it takes some time to take effect.\n1. Ensure you hydrate hydrate hydrate.\n - Basically you just pile it on your moisturiser. I was using multiple serums and multiple creams and finished off with an occlusive every night... while your skin is adjusting to Tretinoin, the acid mantle may be broken and you'll suffer from TEWL big time...\n - In the day... get a mist.. and topup... good over makeup/sunscreen. Perhaps you can use a silcone primer as a kind of occlusive to prevent TEWL. Make sure you topup your sunscreen as Tretinoin makes you uber sun sensitive!\n1. Finish the routine with an occlusive if necessary.\n\n\n* DO NOT USE if pregnant or if you are planning for a baby (applies to females only).\n\n***\n\n[Transepidermal Water Loss \\(TEWL\\)](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32109-2_32) \n\n\n***\n\n**MOISTURE UP - best advice for tretinoin users**\n\nWith moisturisers.. make sure you use all 3 types. This youtube video can explain a lil http://youtu.be/QdNPiW4ZULk \n\n* Occlusives - you want only 1 layer, this is used LAST\n* Emollients -  creams, ointments, lotions and gels. \n* Humectants - as many layers as possible, water based.\n\nYMMV of course.\n\n***\n\nBasically i divide it into 3 categories since the above 3 categories can sometimes overlap\n\n* Water based\n* Non Water based including oils and butters\n* Occlusive\n\n**Tips**\n\n* You want lots and lots of water based moisturisers that are skin identical, water-binding, humectants.\n* Limit the oil based ingredients to 1 not too oily.\n* Unlimited from the water based category. \n* Use the Occlusive last and a thin layer will suffice.\n \n***\n\n#**Ingredients to look out for include:**\n\n**Water based**\n\nMy personal fave are Sodium Hyaluronate and Sodium PCA (similar to Hyaluronic Acid)\nWater binding agents / NMF Natural moisturising factors\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid (HA)\n* Centella asiatica (Gotu Kola)\n* Ceramides\n* DMAE Dimethylaminoethanol / DMAE Bitartrate\n* Genistein\n* Beta Glucan\n* Glycerin\n* Ceramides\n* Lecithin\n* Polysaccharides\n* Hyaluronic Acid\n* Sodim Hyaluronate\n* Sodium PCA\n* Collagen\n* Elastin\n* Proteins\n* Amino Acid\n* Cholesterol\n* Glucose\n* Sucrose\n* Fructose\n* Glycogen\n* Phospholipids\n* Glycosphingolipids\n* Glycosaminoglycan\n* Allantoin helps to improve the water content of the epidermis\n* Panthenol Vitamin B5\n\n***\n\n**Oil based:**\n\nAdd a facial oil but no more than 1 as you don't want to get too oily\n\n* i noticed a lot of people using rosehip oil. I don't think it is a good option as rosehip contains betacarotene and perhaps trace amounts of trans-retinoic acid. If you are using Tretinoin, you don't need any more vitamin A. * Perhaps choose a different facial oil that is more suitable for your skin type. \n * Plenty of Oleic acid for dry skin types and \n * Lots of Linoleic Acid for oily/acne prone skin as the skin is deficient in that Omega 6 fatty acid.\n* Check out [Gothamista's guide to facial oils](https://youtu.be/R1TZwTDlzw4)\n\n\n\n***\n\n**Occlusives**\n\nVaseline has the highest occlusive factor but i prefer the more natural versions instead of petroleum based alternatives.\n\n* Natural versions\n * Squalane / Squalene\n * Lecithin\n * Cocoa butter, Mango and Shea butter: Careful only Shea butter is non comedogenic\n * Coconut oil - comedogenic rating 4\n * Beeswax is a wonderful occlusive ingredient, especially for dry, chapped lip\n * Lanolin -It is a wax not fat secreted by sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Used for its protective and barrier properties.\n\n* Petroleum by products\n * Mineral Oil\n * Isoparaffin\n * Polybutene\n * Synthetic petrol chemical derived ingredients (they give a long term occlusion of the skin,  prevents the skin from recognising the need to repair itself)\n * Silicone\n * Methicone \n * Dimethicone\n * Cyclohexasiloxane\n * many other silicone derivatives (most ending with \"cone\")\n\n\n***\n\n**Skin Soothing ingredients**\n\nWhen you start peeling, this will help the skin reduce inflammation and heal.\n\n* Manuka Honey\n* Gotu Kola / Centella asiatica/ Madecassoside/ Madecassic acid\n* Allantoin\n* Calendula\n* Bisabolol / Camomile\n* Cucumber\n* Aloe Vera\n* Licorice Root\n* Oatmeal\n* Beta-Glucan\n* Zinc oxide (used in baby diaper rash creams too)\n* Snail \n\n***\n\n**Healing ingredients to include**\n\nUse this to accelerate healing from the \"Tret face\"\n\n* Copper peptides\n* EGF/ DNA repair\n\n*** \n\nRetinoids research\n\n* [Retinoids in the treatment of skin aging: an overview of clinical efficacy and safety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699641/) by Siddharth Mukherjee et al.

Because it degrades in the presence of sunlight, if you leave the house at all it will be rendered ineffective (your sunscreen can only protect you so much).  If you want to use tretinoin more aggressively you should probably try to get a larger dose. \n(Speaking as someone whose GP prescribed tretinoin twice daily, all it will do is cause your skin to peel off as if you got a sunburn. Makes it impossible for products to absorb and looks terrible.)",

The first couple of days, my face was red (looks like a mild sunburn), so I took 1 night off of both Retin A and BHA/AHA, then continued the next day. Since then, I haven't experienced anymore irritation except for a bit of flaking around the nose area. \n\nI also seem to do things completely different from everyone else. I put it on pretty much right after I wash my face because I WANT it to get absorbed and not just wash off somehow on the pillow as I sleep or whatever. I also put it right under my eyes/nose area too, because wrinkles in that area. I also don't put anything on my face before or after I apply my Retin A, since I saw somewhere that recommends tret be right next to the skin to be more effective. \n\nI think Retin-A is so effective that I could get away with using it less frequently and being persistent about using it. But on the other hand, I get it on eBay so it's so cheap that I wouldn't care about using it nightly.",

Local product ko lang is Peauty blush. Also may angst ako sa mga naka lip filler na influencers and all those lip products na paulit ulit. Like get 2-3 expensive lippies and be done w it kasi. ). But I got the Jelly Eugenio x Vice brushes and I love them so far. Since I got into Korean makeup techniques, been loving smaller brushes and light layers so these are perfect. \n\nThey are priced so well too! Presyo of a few FilliMilli or the cheapest JungSaemMool brush lang. These are a better buy than travel-sized Marj brushes for me because may bruses na magamit for eyes and brows as well. \n\nThe palettes look good value too IF wala ka pang masyadong products because they look thoughtfully selected. Daming textures and consistencies to play with. But for someone with a full kit, maybe no. Unless you want to experiment w different looks cos there’s enough there for that.",

Examples of petty reasons I haven’t purchased something:\n\n-It’s in a dropper bottle\n\n-It’s in one of those dumb wide mouth jars (looking at you facetheory)\n\n-The branding is over-the-top cutesy or childish (e.g. Elizavecca)\n\n-They advertised the product as “clean”\n\n-They advertised a useless but fancy sounding “hero ingredient” even if it’s not actually the ingredient doing the heavy lifting. For example, it’s an effective soothing serum with niacinamide 2% and panthenol 1% but it’s called “Calming Emulsion with Hokkaido Lily and Babassu Water” 💀\n\n-The name of the brand triggers anti-aging anxiety (Age 20’s, Youth to the People, etc)\n\n-They used annoying overly complicated scientific terms in the product description to seem “high tech” e.g. “rheology modifier” instead of “thickener” - for freaking xanthan gum 😂 (cc NIOD, The Ordinary, facetheory…)\n\n-Their men’s line formulas are identical to the lines marketed to women, but cheaper. Looking at you Clinique. I don’t care if I can technically just buy the men’s product, I’m offended by the capitalist cynicism/exploitation of your core customer base.\n\nETA: this new trend of marketing skincare as “unisex”..(???) All OTC skincare is unisex, AFAIK there is no OTC spironolactone or similar…\n\nETA2: any product name with an overwrought euphemism à la “lip gelée,” “skin drink,” “hydrating glaze,” “eye custard.” It’s a fucking moisturizer/toner/gloss!

        "body": ">They advertised the product as “clean”\n\nThis I'll sometimes tolerate if the product is good in its own right and I like it, but I will absolutely just fuck right off if their \"clean\" marketing involves a long ass list of \"NO X\" before the actual fucking ingredients list when you go to the \"ingredients\" drop down. Dude, I'll know what's not in it WHEN YOU STOP VIRTUE SIGNALLING AND JUST LET ME SEE WHAT *IS* IN IT.\n\nIt also depends on the degree of marketing. If it's just like, an FYI (like, \"Hey, for you folks who care about it, we're clean or don't have parabens or whatever\") then I basically just ignore it because most brands have to do some clean beauty pandering these days, but if it's a core marketing theme, I find it too annoying to stomach. If I'm rolling my eyes every five seconds while trying to read the product description or even just trying to navigate your website to find a product, then I'm probably not going to be in the mood for spending money lol\n\nI'm also funky about packaging, but I'm actually sort of the opposite to you. While I'll buy outside of my preferences if there isn't a better product, I generally like packaging that allows me to very easily get every last bit of product out with minimal effort. If I have to turn into a bloody mechanic to get to the last of the product, I don't want it lol. This means that I love jars and droppers — just stick your finger in or turn it upside down and voila! \n\nThe gendered stuff gets me, too! Gendered skincare lines that fail to address issues that may be specific to one gender irritate me anyway (for example, a line of skincare that just smells differently depending on the marketing vs. a line of skincare that has products that were formulated to apply well if you have a beard) but I level up to \"kind of pissed off\" when the pricing bs happens. It's so silly.\n\nSomething that's probably going to be very region specific but that I'm sure some will relate to is any product or brand marketed for whitening, regardless of whether or not it has ingredients that could theoretically do that.

    "body": "Taking a quick look at my sprawling perfume excel list, I realized that, as of today, I own 17 fragrances by JhaG - out of 22 that have been released since 2010. Yes, I don't have any arguments either. In my defense: Most of the fragrances in my possession are 2ml trial sizes, and some of them I scrounged up for free at a luxury perfumery in Düsseldorf. Most are from the €30 trial sets that inexplicably turn up on my doorstep every few months. What I'm trying to say: I'm delulu, but not quite as bad as I could be. \r  \n\r  \nJuliette has a gun is a totally normal perfume brand that's all over Sephora in the US. In good ole' Germany it's a bit harder to get a hold of, but not as absurdly complicated as idk, Phlur or something (I had to order their discovery set from an exceedingly untrustworthy online store from the Czech Republic and I was seriously surprised that their test set actually arrived at my door and not, say, a severed horse head). \r  \n\r  \nTo share my knowledge and pass it on to the next generation (and most importantly to gain a handy overview for myself), I've decided to write my ultimate Juliette has a Gun review and pester you all with my opinions. So if for some inexplicable reason anyone is interested in a deep dive into the world of Cetalox, Ambroxan and ISO-E-Super: I've got you covered! \r  \n\r  \nQuick note: This was originally written in german, so some jokes and cultural stabs might not translate as well. Sorry!\r  \n\r  \n**⬜💎🗨️ Not a Perfume**\r  \nCetalox®\r  \n\r  \nAh, Not a Perfume. Such a wonderfully stupid concept. Hardly any other... perfume? divides the minds of online fragrance forum participants as decisively as Juliette's dubious claim to fame. Some say it smells like super glue, others smell nothing at all, and a select few have the \"Your skin, but better\" effect. I belong to the latter group, but that's no credit to my super nose, it's simply a genetic advantage. The fragrance molecule interacts with the skin chemistry and creates an individual scent that (for me) smells simple, unobtrusive and clean. I get compliments surprisingly often when I wear NaP or layer it with another fragrance. To balance things off, I can't taste coriander.\r  \n\r  \nEnergy: Do you remember those pheromone perfumes that supposedly subconsciously seduce your preferred sex and literally force them to have sex with you? That, but in an office environment, and instead of sex there's a pay rise.\r  \n\r  \nGrade: 2\r  \n\r  \n**⬜⬜💎💎🗨️🗨️ Not a Perfume Superdose**\r  \nCetalox® + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nIf you can't smell Not a Perfume, youll smell more of nothing here. So, more of the less? It's simply a higher concentration of Cetalox, and for some people this leads to their Eureka moment. For me, it lasts longer than the normal version, and that's it. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: The long-suffering executive secretary of a busy board member who wants to melt into the background. When you try to visualize her facial features, you notice that you can't remember her. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 2+\r  \n\r  \n**⬜🍐💧Pear Inc.**\r  \nPear + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nI'm extremely biased towards Pear Inc. because I had this fragrance with me on our honeymoon in Italy and only associate positive emotions with it. It comes closest to Not A Perfume conceptually, combining a very high level of synthetic fragrance with a hint of soft fruitiness from the pear. It is barely perceptible, more of a light, summery veil. And quite persistent! Even after a hike to Cascate Nardis, it was still on my skin when I jumped into the pool afterwards. At least I deluded myself into think that. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: A luxurious hotel hallway in the Alps with thick, dark gray carpet that cushions every step. To the left, the stairs lead down to the wellness area, where fresh fruit water awaits next to the Roman steam bath. Straight ahead is the room, tastefully furnished with natural materials, where juicy apples and pears are provided every day. Life's good. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 1\r  \n\r  \n**🌹❄️⛓️Lady Vengeance**\r  \nRose + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nMy love, always. Feminine without being overwhelming. Not overly rosy or floral, but, surprise surprise, synthetic. The name is ridiculously out of place, a rose could not be more toothless. Perfect as an everyday fragrance, but I wouldn't dream of describing it as sexy or vampy or horny. Lady Vengeance lives in a very strange place: it doesn't scream, but the fragrance isn't quiet either. Quite strong fragrance notes, good sillage, but it's not overpowering. Despite the rather simple composition, it has its own identity, unlike Pear Inc. which is really just NaP plus pear. I always reach for it when nothing else can excite me. \r  \n\r  \nFun fact: Lady Vengeance was designed by none other than Francis Kurkdjian, and I can feel the vibe. It wouldn't be completely out of place in a MFK line up either. Perhaps a little more place-hunting, but we were all young and fake once. (Sidenote: Francis Kurkdjian also created Green Tea (Elizabeth Arden) and Miss Dior and about a hundred thousand other perfume staples? Sick.) \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: You need to shop/go to group therapy/organize community meetings, but only feel 80% turned on. Lady Vengeance doesn't turn your life around, but at least makes you feel 82%. Maybe even 83. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 1\r  \n\r  \n**⛱️🧂🥥Vanilla Vibes**\r  \nVanilla... and surprisingly no Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nA \"classic\" vanilla fragrance from JhaG, and according to the fragrance pyramid, completely free of synthetic fragrances. Somehow, perhaps through osmosis, the chemical DNA still comes through, characterized here by a suntan lotion accord. More precisely: suntan lotion in the flavor vanilla. Light and airy, very summery. Thanks to fleur de sel, we avoid the boring standard, Vanilla Vibes has a very pleasant and unique character. It is, thank goodness, not a vanilla bomb that causes headaches. Salty, seaside, like a day at the beach. Or better still, the walk home afterwards. Chilling out on the balcony with a view of the pool bar. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: a beach bar made of white wood, the radio playing in the background and the salty sea air lingering on your skin. You've just reapplied sunscreen while watching the cool surfer dudes ride the waves. \r  \n\r  \nScore: 2\r  \n\r  \n**🍳☀️🧍Sunny Side Up**\r  \nVanilla, but this time + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nThe way I would imagine a vanilla fragrance from JhaG: synthetic, but not in a bad way. Sillage and longevity are poor, but that's a positive, remarkable quality in a vanilla perfume. What this egg connotation is all about (the bottle is white with an yolk-yellow cap, plus the name) is not clear to me. Some reviews speak of an eggnog smell, but I attribute that to marketing-induced delusions. For me, it dances the 08/15 sandalwood-vanilla-musk ballet, but completely synthetic and therefore a bit weird, and I like weird, but here the cushy irrelevance dominates. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: Tropical week at IKEA. A cheap white shelf with vanilla deodorant. Pale lack of character with the charm of a Palatine tax clerk (in german, that joke was great). Doesn't hurt anyone, but thats kinda it.\r  \n\r  \nGrade: 3\r  \n\r  \n**🧁🍓🔥mmmh...**\r  \nCake and surprisingly no Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nmmmmh... and Lipstick Fever were the doomed attempts to break away from the Cetalox® DNA and launch two Gourmand fragrances. It has a bit of children's perfume energy, and both my husband and my best freind hate this scent with fervent devotion. I like the playfulness, I like the sultry, candied drydown. There's patchouli involved, and lots of it too. Longevity level: orgyproof. You can still smell the vanilla the morning after, and probably even after a long shower.\r  \n\r  \nEnergy: Your three-year-old niece wants to bake raspberry cake and rolls around in vanilla sugar when you're not looking. Afterwards, you have a one-night stand and no opportunity to shower beforehand. The fragrance accompanies both activities with the same level of enthusiasm.\r  \n\r  \nGrade: 3+\r  \n\r  \n**✨👠💄Lipstick Fever**\r  \nLipstick and surprisingly no Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nLipstick Fever is the scent that made me fall in love with Juliette has a Gun. What's our first idea when we move away from our well-tried Cetalox® nonsense? We make a fragrance that smells like lipstick! 10/10 concept, no notes. It's such an absurd take that you can't help but love this brand. For the uninitiated, lipstick has a very distinctive scent, especially older and more expensive brands smell like iris, vanilla and berries. Of course, each brand has its own scent, but JhaG has somehow managed to nail the lipstick association photo-realistically. I squeal with delight every time I smell it. It's so silly. It's so grandiose. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: You unscrew a brand new MAC lipstick, the surface still shiny, the logo still embossed. The first time you've spent more than 3 euros on a make-up product and you don't regret a cent. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 2+\r  \n\r  \n**🍋🍸🧊Moscow Mule**\r  \nLime + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nI have to write this review from memory. Because my tester of Moscow Mule has been empty for years. This fate is rare in my dragon hoard, and usually ends in buying the full size. The fact that I haven't done so yet has mainly to do with the cringy name. The more I think about it, the less I can think of a reason, because: Moscow Mule is a wonderfully fresh, unobtrusive citrus fragrance with lime, bergamot and ginger. Unisex, even! Absolutely no detergent vibes, which can easily happen with citrus fragrances. More like a homemade lime soda at a Vietnamese restaurant. I have nothing but good memories with this scent and oh god I'm going to buy it soon, aren't I?\r  \n\r  \nEnergy: An afternoon by the pool, but not an outdoor children's paddling pool, but in an expensive, exclusive spa where they serve cucumber-ginger water and nuts and dried fruit. And non-alcoholic cocktails. With a slice of lime. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 1\r  \n\r  \n**🧔🐺🌵Ego Stratis**\r  \nVague men's fragrance + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nWe haven't had a marketing controversy in a while, have we? In the year of the mistress 2022, unisex fragrances are now no longer a topic that causes great turmoil in the perfume world. They haven't really been since 1611 at the latest. JhaG sees it differently and has designed the entire advertising campaign for Ego Stratis around this outlandish concept: A... a...a.a...aquatic fragrance.... for... Women? Eh, no, for men AND WOMEN? But this is a men's fragrance! And WOMEN(!) are supposed to wear it? That's crazy. Look at them, this quirky niche perfumery brand, always on the cutting edge! \r  \n\r  \nWell, Ego Stratis doesn't smell terrible. But it just smells like any run-of-the-mill men's perfume. Aquatic notes, neroli, cedarwood, yadda yadda. There's really nothing genderbent about it. I imagine a more subtle sweetness than Axe green, but the hint of fruitiness (blueberry?) is immediately crushed by the musk ox. You have to pay a pretty penny at JhaG to be allowed to wear a men's fragrance as a woman. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: Axe shower gel, but make it high-fashion. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 3-\r  \n\r  \n**🍂🌒🧿Another Oud**\r  \nNorlimbanol™ + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nOhhh, Romano has found a second reagent in his chemistry set! I giggle at my good joke as I aim the (very poorly designed) test diffuser at my arm. One spray and my pupils dilate. Oh. Oh.\r  \n\r  \nOud is a special fragrance composed of woody, smoky accords. It tends to be found more in men's perfumery and is very popular in Arabic perfumes. Together with norlimbanol, another woody fragrance molecule, it creates a very round, pleasant, warm fragrance. It has a distinct medicinal note, and I'm MEGA into it, but I can imagine it's controversial. Now THAT is a unisex fragrance! Much more androgynous than whatever Ego Stratis tried. I want to press my nose into it all day, it's that great. Oops, now it's accidentally ended up in husbands shelv, how could that have happened?\r  \n\r  \nEnergy: The most self-confident man at the gangbang. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 1\r  \n\r  \n**👔🚿🧼Musc Invisible**\r  \nCotton and surprisingly no Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nMh, nothing is invisible here. It's the most penetrating clean laundry smell this side of the Speefuchs (thats, um... german Mr Proper, but as a furry). The invisible Elon smells more washed than my laundry. Soapy, slightly pungent, SoFt, ClEaN, nAtuRal, all the buzzwords. Heavy scented candle vibes, specifically Clean Cotton by Yankee Candle. Laugh at me, but I miss the cetalox. This fragrance simply has no identity at all. The reviews on Parfumo are all happy that it's so atypical for the top dog-synthetic-chemical-pants-jarring-Julia, finally no cetalox bomb. Yes, and that's why it sucks? If you want soft naturalness, go to Elizabeth Arden or roll around in the moss or something.\r  \n\r  \nEnergy: A good, German housewife (m/f/d) who hangs up her freshly starched, spotless white sheets on an alpine meadow and then lets Meister Proper fuck her.\r  \n\r  \nGrade: 4\r  \n\r  \n**🌺🌼🌴Lust for Sun**\r  \nSun cream + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nI don't need to mention how well JhaG executes the concept of \"Nivea Sun Milk SPF 50\", but the first sniff beams me straight to a bed castle in Can Picafort circa 1996. Mission accomplished. It's the summer scent of summer scents, and maybe I'm stupid, but I can even smell the panthenol for the sunburn afterwards. After the milky opening, the scent becomes brutally brute floral (that worked better in german: brutal-brachial floral) with ylang-ylang, monoï, gardenia and every other flower you can find in a well-stocked allergy specialty store. If I get a headache, that's saying something. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: A very drunk and questionably legal teenager on the dance floor of the local village disco for SummerJam with DJ HouseKasper, where the vodka energy still costs 1.50 euros and everyone around her goes home with an inexplicable headache. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 3\r  \n\r  \n**🫧☁️➿Ode to Dullness**\r  \nSkin cream + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nJhaG was apparently in his Nivea era in 2023, because Ode to Dullness is inspired by the creamy nothingness of the best skincare for anyone unfamiliar with Kaufmann's children's cream. Well, not that it smells like Nivea (we don't want to get sued), it's more of a cloudy lotion vibe. General skincareness. It doesn't create much of a scent, but I smelled myself at the newly opened supermarket and was pleasantly taken with it every time. Soft, pleasant, clean, unspectacular. It is supposed to depict the comfortable wasteland of everyday life and yes, I can subscribe to that. Doesn't have to be a bad thing. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: You almost bite the head off an extremely slow-moving lady in the supermarket who stops right in front of you to study her shopping list, but then a cloud of fragrance caresses you and you remember that it's not that deep. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 2-\r  \n\r  \n**🍑✨👄Magnolia Bliss**\r  \nYoullneverguess + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nAfter so many tragic attempts to do anything different with the DNA of Juliette has a Gun, Magnolia Bliss is a welcome return to its roots. It's dumb fun, artificial until the day after tomorrow, a little childish, floral and fruity and synthetic and feathery. The floral magnolia isn't so much in the foreground, I primarily notice the peach/mirabelle/apricot jamminess. Orange Cat Behavior, but as a perfume. Just as many brain cells, too. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: peach rings meets nail polish remover. \r  \n\r  \nScore: 1-\r  \n\r  \n**🍒❌🚬Juliette**\r  \nCherry + Cetalox®\r  \n\r  \nAccording to the marketing material, Juliette is supposed to be the culmination of 15 years of perfumery artistry, the ultimate statement of the brand, its identity in a nutshell, an iconic fragrance for all time. Ironically, Juliette is completely free of the JhaG DNA. What's this stuffy seriousness in my synthetic bomb brand? Are we at Maison Francis Kurkdjian here or what? Confident Complexity my ass. I want Lost Cherry, but in stupid! Mh, okay, that's already Lost Cherry. But I thought JhaG, like every self-respecting perfume house about four years ago, had finally come out with its own cherry gum variation. But I was bitterly disappointed. Or rather, peppery disappointed. Juliette is strangely dark and edgy, the pepper surprisingly dominant. The cherry quickly fades away - it's only here for marketing purposes, after all - before the cashmeran, jasmine and cetalox doze off into their twilight years. Boring. \r  \n\r  \nEnergy: None. \r  \n\r  \nGrade: 3",

I don’t have many skin concerns as I have really perfected a routine for myself, but really trying to fade some teenage acne scarring/achieve better texture overall. \n\nList of items purchased:\n1. Mamonde Bakuchiol lifting cream (purple box); previously had the toner from the same line, but felt it didn’t do much and this has slightly more retinol product from what I hear. I use it twice a day and it’s going well so far! Had light ‘purging’ when I upped it from 1 to 2 times a day, but added a moisturizer in my routine and that immediately stopped the ‘purging’\n\n2. Mediheal Collagen Pads; for occasional use/relaxation~ makes my skin feel very soft the next day!\n\n3. Caffeine under eye gel patches by K-secret; also for fun on occasional spa days (they had a few ‘flavors’ to purchase) \n\n4. COSRX advanced snail 92; use it nightly as my final step to seal in my other creams- LOVE IT will repurchase in two years when I finally finish one can, a little goes a long way~\n\n5. Laneige water sleeping mask; I know it doesn’t work for a lot of people, but I have repurchased this for years because I notice a difference when I run out/it’s not in my routine. I use it nightly, and it helps my skin heal/keep moisture.\n\n6. La Roche-Posay vitamin C10 serum; pricey but does make my skin glowier! This is my second bottle, first one lasted maybe 5 or 6 months. \n\n7. RoundLab pine calming cica cream; I’m still not a big believer in moisturizers in general yet, but this did calm my slight purge from my first product purchased on this list, and LOVE cica in products. \n\n8. Avene hydrance pre-serum; it helps add moisture in my morning routine before serums! \n\n9. BOH bioheal toning melisma serum(for my mom); she enjoys it lol\n\n10. BB labs collagen packets; they taste pretty good! \n\n11. (Second picture) innisfree jeju hallabong toner; ~might~ be a jeju exclusive? Haven’t tried it yet, but excited to add it!\n\n\nMy daily skincare routine:\nAM\n-wash face with water\n- toner (almost empty and then switching to innisfree)\n-Avene preserum\n-vitamin c10 serum LRP\n-BOH panthenol cica serum\n-mamonde retinol cream\n-roundlab cream/moisturizer \n-MISSHA sunscreen \n\nPM\n-double cleanse/single cleanse in shower \n-Jeju pore pads by shingmulnara\n-Mamonde retinol cream\n-Laneige\n-COSRX snail 92\n\n\nIf anyone has any advice for my routine lmk! Always ready to grow my knowledge of skincare",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

See this write up by Fifty Shades of Snail from a few years ago: https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/05/11/why-i-stopped-using-hada-labo-hyaluronic-acid-lotion/\n\nHyaluronic Acid is just a humectant (AFAIK.) And yes, I do understand that it's a naturally occurring component of our skin, that, as a humectant, it's super effective, holds 1000 times it's molecular weight in water, etc. I get all that. But it's just so supremely boring.\n\nMore importantly, though, is that I find Hyaluronic Acid to be extremely inelegant. For the life of me, I do not understand how people can layer something like the Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotions 🤯\n\nAnother thing is, Hyaluronic Acid is in *everything*. Why would I ever dedicate an entire step in my routine or a product to **just** Hyaluronic Acid? It just doesn't make any sense to me.\n\nLike I said, call me crazy.\n\n#So, what are your favorite non-HA humectants and the products that contain them? \n\n\nHere's a quick list of humectants commonly used in skincare, off the top of my head:\n\nGlycerin\n\nAmino Acids\n\nButylene Glycol\n\nPanthenol\n\nUrea\n\nAloe\n\nHoney\n\nSnail\n\nFerments\n\nTremella Mushroom\n\nPolyglutamic Acid\n\nBeta Glucan\n\nAs an example, personally I much prefer glycerin to Hyaluronic Acid. I find it to be much more layerable, much more lightweight, much less sticky and much less weighty. \n\nAlso, I'm really into amino acids and urea right now. Both are also NMFs, like Hyaluronic Acid, but, again, more elegant and deeply hydrating.\n\nPanthenol and urea also play a role in skin barrier repair. Aloe and honey are soothing. So they are more than just humectants.",

It’s the best mix of ingredients I’ve found so far for my skin. HA tends to be so hit or miss for me and feels like a one-trick pony.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

HA It's just a keyword to use because everyone is under the impression that it is awesome but if you know anything about true skin care and how HA really works in the body, you know that it is not good for you. The only time HA is good is if you have a special event or a wedding where you only need to have your skin look plumped and it's best for only a few hours but it's definitely something you do not want to eat everyday!!!

    "body": "Hey guys! I haven't really heard this product being talked about in here, so I thought I would write a review/first impressions. \n\n**Skin1004 Zombie Pack** (Korean)\n\n\nHi my name is Bluecowboyboots and I am a mask addict. \n\n*hello bluecowboyboots*\n\nI sheet mask daily, I am constantly looking for new sheet masks to try and I scare my boyfriend and dog constantly looking like Jason from Friday the 13th. My bfs nickname for me sometimes is Sheet Mask Monster\n\nHowever, for the past two months I have avoided all wash off masks because I have been repairing my skin that was very dehydrated and irritated. \n\n**BUYING**\n \nAfter reading one of my favorite mask dedicated blogs Maskepedia, I was browsing and came across her [Post](https://maskepedia.com/2017/09/26/review-skin1004-zombie-pack/) on the Skin1004 Zombie Pack. What intrigued me was that it was able to \"diagnose\" your skin (not sure if it is a gimmick or not) and provide instant results.\n \nI freaked!! It looked like a similar mask to [Hanacure](https://www.hanacure.com/products/the-all-in-one-facial-set) that my friends rave about but without the $110 price tag. \nDespite all my friends rave reviews, I couldn't justify spending $110 dollars on a treatment that includes FOUR applications that total to $27.5 Each. \n\nI impulsively bought it on Amazon for $19.98 dollars. It includes 8 treatments (thats $2.50 a treatment. heck yeaah dolla make me holla!) \n\nIt came to my house in two days  *thanks amazon prime/bae* (don't tell my bf) \n\nThe powder consists of nine organic ingredients including albumin, corn powder, aloe berry leafy extract and lavender oil, while the activator contains over 15 ingredients that work mainly on pore tightening and wrinkle care.\n\n\n**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**\n\n\nSkin1004's [website](http://www.skin1004indonesia.com/product/detail/skin1004-zombie-pack-8pack-brush) \nclaims that it is:  \n\nA 8-in-1 full-face TREATMENT MASK : in only 15 minutes, get a facial that\n1. Reduces fine lines and wrinkles,\n2. Visibly lifts up your skin,\n3. Clears small breakouts and acne\n4. Tightens enlarged pores,\n5. Hydrates your skin deeply,\n6.

After mixing the powder and activator, apply the mask on your face and feel it getting to work instantly!\"\n\nPore Tightening: The Zombie Pack will instantly tighten pores for a visible effect. \n \nSkin Lifting: Active ingredients such as Albumin help to instantly lift the skin while Copper Peptide and Rose of Jericho help to strengthen the skin\n\n**MAIN INGREDIENTS**\n\n*Albumin : Known as a component from eggs, this is a protein made of amino acids, and is effective for attracting moisture to the skin - this is great for skin elasticity!*\n \n*Centella Asiatica : Effective for soothing and calming the skin, this ingredient is especially perfect for those with acne prone, or sensitive skin.*\n\n\n**Powder ingredients:**\n\n*Albumen, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Silica, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Propolis Extract, Fragrance*\n\n**Activator ingredients:**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Adenosine, Allantoin. Panthenol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Glycerin, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Echinacea Angustifolia Extract. Commiphora Mukul Resin Extract*\n\n**COMMENTARY**\n\nThe ingredients really intrigued me, I liked how it contains Centella because my skin LOVES it for my redness. Ingredients like Centalla, Niacinamide and Aloe are pretty high up on the list. \n\nI know many people with sensitive skin can't do fragrance, but weirdly lavender oil has never really bugged my skin. \n\nThe package comes with 8 powder packets (attached together so you can break them off), 8 activator packets (in a sealed bag) and a brush. \n\nThe instructions are to pour the activator in the powder packet and mix it to a liquid consistency. \n\n\n**PRE MASKING :**\n\nMy skin: \n\nIt is almost winter in the midwest and my skin has been very dry, slightly dehydrated and red.  \nMy concerns are : \n\n- Visible pores around my nose \n\n- lots of redness and PIE from hormonal breakouts on my jawline and some of my cheeks. \n\n- forehead wrinkles ( I am 24, and I want to be preventative as well) \n\n- irritation: my skin HATES physical scrubs, clay masks etc \n\n\n**MASKING**\n\nI apply the whole mask over my face per what the directions. I applied a little bit more around my areas of concern (my nose and cheeks and jawline/chin) \n\nThe directions said to wait 15 minutes and leave the mask on for the long TOPS. \n\nI double cleansed my skin and applied the mast. \n\nThe mask kind of smelled like egg, but that didnt really bug me. It was drippy and I accidentally dripped some on my dog (sorry doggo) \n\nFirst few minutes, the mask was starting to dry, i felt no irritated. \n\n5 minutes later - HOLY CRAP my face started to feel tight. I could make NO expression. \n\n10 minutes later - it kind of started to itch a little but I told myself I would stick it for 5 more minutes (no pain no gain amirite?) \n\n15 minutes later - I looked in the mirror, crap. I looked scary. My bf said I looked like I was 88 years old. My face felt tight and frozen. I LOOKED LIKE A ZOMBIE OLD LADY\n\n**DIAGNOSING MY SKIN**\n\nThe website says areas that are bumpy are Areas that lack elasticity, and are prone to wrinkles.\nAreas that are cracked are areas that lack hydration \n\nI thought that I would have bumps on my forehead. But in all actuallity pretty much my whole face was cracked. (SMH -_-) \nThe only areas that were bumpy were my undereye area, temples and my smile lines.\n\nWhat does this tell me? That I need to load up on hydration more (drink a lot more water) and maybe get a better eyecream haha \n\n**DID MY SKIN LIKE IT?**\n\nI washed it off, my skin felt pretty tight. and it was a bit red but ohhh myyyy. My pores looked so much smaller and my skin looked a little bit brighter. \n\nI showered, continued on with my night routine and went to bed. \n\n\nWaking up, my skin looked super smooth, my pores were still small and there was little redness except for a few pimples I had on my jawline. I looked a lot brighter.\n\n\n**MY THOUGHTS**\n\nDo you want to scare your BF or significant other into thinking your age is actually 64 years older than you said. \n\nDo you want all your friends to laugh at a photo you sent them asking \"What is wrong with your face?\" \n\nDo you want your face to look pretty and smooth like an instagram filter the next day? \n\nDo you want to not spend $110 dollars on a Hanacure mask? \n\nIf you answered yes to one of those, this mask is for you! \n\nThe instructions say to do it 3 times a week. but I don't think my sensitive skin will be able to handle that so I will save it for special events or if I am bored and want to spook people. [mwahahaha](https://giphy.com/gifs/planning-happy-gif-evil-plan-14nNwczrhgaQ5G)\n\nOverall id give it a 4/5, I loved the price point, it was fun, and I would deff buy it again but I havent used it enough for HG status. \nI also really liked the brush it came with. \n\nWhere you can buy it :\n\n[Amazon]( https://www.amazon.com/Skin1004-Zombie-Pack-set-treatments/dp/B06XZV7ZGC/ref=sr_1_3_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1542723676&sr=1-3&keywords=skin1004%2Bzombie%2Bpack&th=1) for $19.87 USD \n\n[YessStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/skin-1004-zombie-pack-set-powder-2g-x-8pcs-activator-3-5ml-x-8pcs/info.html/pid.1066657689) for $15.16 USD - It is on sale right now! \n\nI will be posting this review on my Instagram as well: [@lafilledifficile_](https://www.instagram.com/lafilledifficile_/)\n\n\nEDIT : Opps pardon my research but someone last year reviewed the same mask, you can find that review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/6oxkff/review_skin1004_zombie_pack_korean_special_facial/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

I bought it off Amazon and you have to mix a liquid into a powder pod with a brush, lots of mask for my small face so I layer it all on so I don’t waste. The drying part is so uncomfortable, at minute 10 I’m ready to claw my face off. The part where there are bumpy parts and cracked parts are true, interesting to experience where those parts are, somewhat what I expected. \nBUT, your skin looks amazing after, I have dry acne prone skin and it does not irritate it from what I’ve experienced. I wash my face first, apply, rinse off then use a cleansing toner after and apply a face oil before bed. Wake up and skin looks great. Almost as if life’s horrors haven’t aged me an extra 10 years. I use it maybe once a week if I have time, I can see how twice a week would help but for cost and saving money I’m happy with once every 1-2 weeks.",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

    "body": "# PREFACE\n\nMy old go-to western cleanser was reformulated a few years ago and I've embarked on a quest for the perfect cleanser. While I haven't found my ultimate HG, I've had some interesting experiences: some good, some not so good... These are all the cleansers I've used this year.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I try to be as honest as possible with my reviews. That said, my skin is *extremely* reactive and my ratings reflect that. YMMV! - I should also mention that although I'll be describing scents, all the products I've listed are fragrance free, with a maximum of one essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SKIN TYPE:** Combo leaning oily. \n\n* **Proclivities:** Sensitive with mild rosacea, often dehydrated, and breakout-prone.\n* **Sensitivities:** Shea Butter, Fragrance, Essential Oils, and often Niacinamide. \n* **Climate:** Southeastern Canada, “humid continental”. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CURRENT ROUTINE:**\n\n* DEAR, KLAIRS Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil (PM)\n* ISNTREE Green Tea Fresh Cleanser (AM/PM)\n* (non-AB) PAULA’S CHOICE 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (PM, twice weekly)\n* COSRX Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner (AM/PM)\n* COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (AM/PM)\n* ETUDE HOUSE SoonJung 10-Free Moist Emulsion (AM/PM)\n* ILLIYOON Ceramide ATO Concentrate Cream (PM, often)\n* (non-AB) EUCERIN Aquaphor Healing Ointment (PM, sometimes)\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Water Fit Sun Serum (AM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WATER-BASED CLEANSERS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CETAPHIL Gentle Skin Cleanser - OG** (non-AB)\n\n* **Price:** \\~$8 for 500ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate 😳\n* **Used For:** \\~10 years\n* **Scent:** Doctor’s Office\n* **Wash Sensation:** Uninspired\n* **Finish:** Untouched\n* **User Experience:** The hideous bottle, clinical scent, and uh… boyish texture make this an utterly joyless cleansing experience. But it’s as cheap as I am. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Gentle, non-drying, and doesn’t do a great job of cleansing, but TBH that’s often what I *want*. The best western cleanser I’ve tried, and my \"HG\" for many years, because sometimes you just need something that doesn't ruin your skin. **4/5**\n* **RATING: 6/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CETAPHIL Gentle Skin Cleanser - Reformulation** (non-AB)\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 500ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Niacinamide 😒\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Hospital\n* **Wash Sensation:** Disappointed\n* **Finish:** Irritated & Itchy\n* **User Experience:** Same as above, but it smells much worse and stings on contact. **1/5**\n* **Effects:** With the added “benefit” of the niacinamide, this felt similar to the original, but more drying. It also provides a long lasting itch and a slight flush! **1/5**\n* **RATING: 1/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ROUND LAB - Mugwort Calming Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$15 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Mugwort Extracts 🧐, Sage Oil 😒, Green Tea Extract 🥰, Allantoin 🥰, Madecassoside 🥰, Panthenol 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Irish-Spring-But-Herbal\n* **Wash Sensation:** Slightly Attacked\n* **Finish:** Very Dry\n* **User Experience:** I was curious to try for the mugwort scent, but found it bland and soapy. This does a great job of cleansing, and creates buckets of foam that get into every orifice on my face. Probably not the best choice for my first foaming cleanser after a decade+ of only using milky gels. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Holy drying, Batman! I tried to convince myself that I just needed to get used to foam, but no. Just no. **1/5**\n* **RATING: 3/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ROUND LAB - 1025 Dokdo Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Chamomile Oil 😒, Hyaluronic Acid 💦, Ceramide NP 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~1 month\n* **Scent:** Chamomile & Plastic\n* **Wash Sensation:** Fluffy\n* **Finish:** Slightly Dry / Slightly Filmy\n* **User Experience:** Smells neutral yet slightly plasticky with a hint of chamomile. I found this vastly more pleasant to use. Same as above: literal pea sized amount = foam for days, but it gets extra points for the less offensive scent. Also the little seal on the bottle fills me with joy and I'm simple that way. **3/5**\n* **Effects:** This is much gentler than and not as drying as the Mugwort, but it also leaves a moisturizing film that I don’t like. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 5/10 WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISNTREE - Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$18 for 220ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Yam Root Extract 🧐,  Oat Meal Extract 🙃\n* **Used For:** \\~a few days\n* **Scent:** Unsweetened Taro Bubble Tea\n* **Wash Sensation:** Creamy & Surprised\n* **Finish:** Liberally Buttered\n* **User Experience:** This has such a beautiful creamy scent. It would have been a gentle, soothing experience if my face didn’t just EAT IT UP. I tried using this on both wet and dry skin, but no matter what, my skin was hungry for yam. This alarmed me... Not what I want from a cleanser. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** I often have good luck with products for dry skin because I’m sensitive, but this was a good reminder that *I do, in fact, have oily skin*. Despite this cleanser instantly absorbing into my skin, it also left a thick moisturizing film that broke me out nearly instantaneously. **1/5**\n* **RATING: 3/10 WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BEAUTY OF JOSEON - Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$11 for 100ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Green Tea Extract 🥰, so many plant extracts 😒\n* **Used For:** \\~2 weeks\n* **Scent:** Heavenly Bittersweet Plum\n* **Wash Sensation:** Completely Delighted\n* **Finish:** Very Moisturized\n* **User Experience:** The best smelling cleanser I’ve ever used. This has a sweet and fruity scent with an intriguingly sour edge. It’s a fun, goopy gel that creates an extremely tight and luxurious foam. It feels so modern and innovative!. Plus the package is utterly beautiful. **5/5**\n* **Effects:** This is so gentle and leaves my skin feeling extremely moisturized, while doing a better job of cleansing than a western milky gel. But in less than a week it gave me hella whiteheads. I continued to use it for a further week because I was in denial. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 7/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ETUDE HOUSE - SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Madecassoside 🥰, Green Tea Extract 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~2 weeks\n* **Scent:** Grassy Almond Water\n* **Wash Sensation:** Soft & Velvety\n* **Finish:** Untouched\n* **User Experience:** The best foaming cleanser I’ve ever tried. This has the same soothing grassy almond milk scent as the rest of the SoonJung line with just a touch of plastic. One pump creates the perfect amount of silky foam. Small gripe: despite how gentle this is, it gives me a lil eye sting. **4/5**\n* **Effects:** Does an excellent job of cleansing without being stripping, breaking me out, or leaving a film, but I also don’t find it hydrating or moisturizing - it’s just neutral. If someone's looking for a replacement for their bland western cleanser, this would be my top recommendation. That said, it might be a touch too drying for a twice-daily cleanse.  **4/5**\n* **RATING: 8/10 - MRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISNTREE - Green Tea Fresh Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$17 for 120ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Green Tea Leaf Powder 🥰, Green Tea Leaves 😒, Green Tea Extract 🥰, Hyaluronic Acid 💦\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Hot Green Tea\n* **Wash Sensation:** Refreshed\n* **Finish:** Untouched & Hydrated\n* **User Experience:** The packaging doesn’t thrill me, but this is a lovely gel that creates a loose, barely-there foam. It smells delightful, and even though I can't use anything with fragrance, I love a good scent. This cleanser smells like a freshly-brewed hot cup of over-steeped green tea. It also has tiny leaves in it that mostly evaporate on contact, but I’ll occasionally get a bigger chunk and have to fish it out because I can’t deal with any amount of physical exfoliation. **4/5**\n* **Effects:** This is so gentle without being overbearingly moisturizing. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated even if I don’t apply additional hydration immediately afterwards. - This would absolutely be HG if not for the leaves, and I would highly recommend it to all but the driest of the dry skinned people. **5/5**\n* **RATING: 9/10 - WRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FIRST CLEANSERS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BIODERMA - Sensibio Micellar Cleansing Water** (non-AB)\n\n**Price:** \\~$15 for 250ml (IIRC)\n\n* **Notable Ingredients:** Cucumber Fruit Extract 🙃\n* **Used For:** \\~5 years\n* **Scent:** Clinical Water\n* **Wash Sensation:** Cautious & Afraid\n* **Finish:** Sad & Soapy\n* **User Experience:** Apparently, even the finest Shiseido cotton pads are too exfoliating for my skin. This does a fine job of removing makeup and sunscreen, but I really don’t find this that gentle (possibly because of the friction with the cotton pads). - I know I’m in the minority here, but rosacea-prone skin really do be like that. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Okay as a first cleanse, but if I use this on its own it breaks me out like crazy, even if I rinse it off. This makes me nervous to use it in general, and I'd rather just use an oil cleanser so I'm not wasting cotton pads. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 4/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DEAR KLAIRS - Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$22 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Sunflower Seed Oil 😐, Grape Seed Oil 😐, Jojoba Seed Oil 😐, Black Currant Seed Oil 😐\n* **Used For:** \\~8 months\n* **Scent:** Absolutely Neutral\n* **Wash Sensation:** Dubious\n* **Finish:** Slightly Tight\n* **User Experience:** I’ve technically been oil cleansing for \\~20 years because my childhood friend’s dad was a clown and taught me the way. That said, this is my first *actual* oil cleanser, and it's obviously miles ahead of well... food. - This smells like nothing, glides smoothly over my skin, and emulsifies instantly, but it could be gentler. **3/5**\n* **Effects:** The longer I use this, the less I like it. At first it worked wonderfully, but after many months it feels more drying with every use. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 5/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISO: a new oil cleanser!** Thinking of trying either the Muji Mild Cleansing Oil or Peach & Lily Ginger Melt, but LMK if you have any suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[MANY EDITS: Mostly formatting, extra details, etc.\\]",

I love the way you describe everything and now I really want to try grassy almond water 😂 Was also really proud to see the Isntree green tea cleanser ranked so highly, it's one of my favorites too! For cleansing oils, if you haven't tried it I'd tentatively recommend Purito's From Green Cleansing Oil - it's been a long time since I've used it (I get too excited and want to try every product out there), but when I used it my skin barrier was terribly damaged and it was still really gentle, never stung etc. If you want to try another foam cleanser, I'd recommend the Real Barrier cream cleansing foam - I got mine at a great discount (StyleKorean, $9.90 for 220ml) and it's a nice balance between cream and foam cleansers imo! We seem to have similar skin types so I think this would work well for you in the fall/winter, though it does contain some essential oils so I'd tread carefully!",

My skin is also sensitive to fragrance and a little dry so finding an oil cleanser that is fragrance free non drying and doesn’t have those ingredients feels so rare. I currently am enjoying the Fancl Mild Cleansing Oil. Some other ones that interest me that seem to maybe be gentle are the Peach & Lily Ginger Melt (as you suggested), and the Krave Beauty",

I'm also the same as you, but more on the dehydrated prone skin issue. Anything drying will wrecked my skin.

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nI am going to review as many sunscreens as I can based on the many I have tried over the years. This is going to be a long one, but it is because I want to be specific and give as many relevant details as possible. I have normal skin I’d say with combo tendencies - I live in a climate that has super dry winters and really humid summers, so I change my routine a lot over the year. \n\nMy AM routine is as follows:\n\n1. Splash with water\n2. COSRx’s Propolis Synergy Pads\n3. Isntree’s Onion Newpair Essence Toner\n4. Cos de Baha’s 10% Azelaic Acid Serum\n5. iUNIK’s Beta Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n6. Gel Cream\n7. Sunscreen\n\nMy PM routine:\n\n1. Oil/Balm Cleanser\n2. Foaming Cleanser\n3. Peter Thomas Roth’s Unwrinkle Turbo Toning Lotion\n4. Cos de Baha’s 20% Niacinamide Serum\n5. NIOD’s Survival 0\n6. Gel Cream\n7. COSRx’s B5 D-Panthenol Cream\n8. Isntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\nI am going to rate each on a scale of 1-5, and will discuss what I liked or disliked. I tend to like sunscreens that dry down to a hydrated yet dry-to-the-touch finish, don’t become more oily or provoke dryness throughout the day, don’t leave a white cast, don’t have fragrance or alcohol, and don’t clog pores. I am going to vaguely say something has an impressive ingredient list a few times, so I will briefly list some ingredients I look for:\n\n1. Preference on hybrid sunscreens\n2. B vitamins, primarily panthenol and niacinamide\n3. Ceramides\n4. Antioxidant- or generally nutrient-heavy, non-fragrant extracts like centella asiatica, broccoli, pine, etc.\n5. Antioxidants like vitamins C and E; ferulic acid, etc.\n6. Peptides\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++\n\n3.75/5\n\nThis is a hard one for me, because it is truly one of my go-to’s in the winter time and I have a weird affinity for it. It is surprisingly emollient to the point where I was glowing all day even in the driest of winters. This is never, ever dry to the touch; but it leaves you with such a hydrated and healthy glow that I can’t complain about it. This, at the same time, is a tricky one to recommend for dry climates because of its HA contents. For some, hyaluronic acid is a loss-heavy hydrator if not sealed in, and since this is the last step, it’s difficult to recommend it. It is a wash in humid weather, and actively causes acne for me when I try to wear it in those climates. I love it, though! It has such an amazing smell (I love sunscreen smell don’t @ me) and I just love its texture. Its ingredient list is a genuine humble brag, as well. \n\nSkin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50 PA++++\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis, to me, is like an upgrade of the Isntree sunscreen. It is surprisingly similar to me in terms of ingredients and texture, but it dries down rather immediately. It keeps my skin very moisturized and hydrated, leaving a nice hydrated finish that doesn’t get oilier throughout the day. I worry this will dry me out in the winter, but in the currently very humid summer I have been going to this one more and more often. \n\nCanmake’s Mermaid Gel UV SPF50+ PA++++ Clear\n\n4.25/10\n\nThis is a classic for a reason, and it was my first AB sunscreen that I tried. It has no white cast, has a neat little smell, and it is surprisingly moisturizing for a sunscreen that dries down to a dewy yet try to the touch finish. This will always be a go-to, but I don’t like wearing it in the winter because it will dry out my skin and lead to some oily redness on my forehead. Perfect for the summer, as well as any day that it’s not oppressively dry. It has an amazing ingredient list, as well. My main issue is that it pills very easily - more so than any other sunscreen I’ve used. It’s just weird to me that it’s made by a makeup company and they couldn’t nail that part down haha.\n\niUNIK’s Centella Soothing Sun Cream\n\n9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n\n5/5\n\nThis is remarkably similar to Canmake’ sunscreen for me. I find that it has a very similar texture, but instead of the yellow tinted color, it’s a bit green. It ends up being a bit whiter as you rub it in, as well. This is a genuinely impressive ingredient list as far as extracts go, with pine of course being at the forefront. I love how antioxidant heavy it is, but I also think it dries down to this lovely, glassy finish. I prefer it over Canmake’s because of its more specialized ingredient list and lack of anecdotal pilling. The finish is just so silky smooth and healthy - I am a huge fan of this one. \n\nLa Roche Posay’s Anthelios UV Correct SPF 70\n\n4.75/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and if it weren’t so emollient it would be a 5/5. This is literally an SPF 70, but goes onto the face as if it were clear. I would say that apart from invisible sunscreens, this has the most immediately clear cast I’ve ever seen. It’s very thick, and smells violently of La Roche Posay sunscreen - that is to say amazing. It leaves your skin (and especially your pores) looking vehemently healthy, as if you’re actually eating your vegetables. The one problem is that it is too moisturizing for humid climates and will leave a layer on your skin even when you just apply a little. I haven’t had issues with clogged pores, but I do prefer to have my skin be dry to the touch. I am looking forward to testing this out in the winter months, and despite this being one of the most expensive sunscreens on this list, I will be repurchasing.\n\nPipette’s Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n2/5 \n\nThis is a no-go for me. It’s too moisturizing for a mineral sunscreen in my opinion, which may get a lot of people who enjoy it for that reason. This sunscreen bugs me because it advertises to people of color and brags about having no white cast when it is literally an SPF 50 Zinc-only sunscreen. Don’t lie, man. And it is a lie - while this has one of the tamest white casts I’ve seen on a sunscreen of its prior description, it is still basically white paint. It also stings when I use it, which almost never happens with sunscreens for me. It’s literally made for babies. It’s an amazing body sunscreen, but considering how much I love this brand, I have a mini beef with this product. \n\nBiossance’s Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis is fine - very similar to the above with less of a white cast and less of a chance to burn my skin. It is almost the same formulation as they have the same parent company. It is just super overpriced and virtually the same as a much cheaper product. I invest in their parent company (Amyris) because they're doing some super cool work that has the potential to be huge in the future of skincare, so believe me when I tell you I don't like their sunscreens haha.\n\nZitsticka’s MEGASHADE Breakout-proof SPF 50 Serum\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a top tier sunscreen, and I am surprised I have never really seen it mentioned online. It has a stunning ingredient list (truly… amazing), and it’s one of the only hybrid American sunscreens I’ve seen. It’s also very widely available, but has small packaging at a hefty price tag. The smell is amazing as far as sunscreens go (again I love the smell of sunscreens), and it has a very white color that goes away pretty quickly. It is a liquid sunscreen that comes in a serum bottle with a dropper. Because of it being a liquid, I find it sometimes difficult to disperse as it doesn’t quite sink in, or rather have the sensation of sinking in like other, thicker sunscreens have. It stays true to its breakout-proof promise, but I find that it isn’t dry to the touch and will get progressively oilier throughout the day. It makes your pores look super healthy, and gives you a hydrated, dewy finish, though! \n\nSupergoop’s Every. Single. Face. Watery Lotion SPF 50\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is one of the worst sunscreens I’ve tried because it is both very moisturizing \\*and\\* heavy on the alcohol. It dries you out \\*and\\* leaves you with a visibly oily finish. This could be the perfect sunscreen for someone, though, as it is a lovely consistency, smells pretty nice, and has absolutely no white cast. My skin just kind of hated it haha. \n\nEtude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4/5\n\nI love this one, and got it at a really decent price on sale recently. It is thoroughly moisturizing, has an interesting creamy texture I don’t see often, and has no white cast. When it is on your skin and needs to be rubbed in, it’s already basically clear. Once on, it dries down and leaves no visible oiliness at all, seemingly right off the bat; while leaving my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout most of the day. I’ve noticed this has a tendency to dry out my skin as I get towards the end of the day, though, so I am giving it a 4/5 despite it checking almost every box.\n\nBlack Girl Sunscreen’s Make It Matte SPF 45\n\n4.75/5\n\nThis is a dupe of the Unseen Sunscreen with a more basic ingredient list. I see this as a good thing, though. This kind of sunscreen is popular for a very good reason - it is visibly mattifying while also pulling off the cool feat of being completely clear. It is very moisturizing, and I’ve never experienced any issues after wearing it throughout the day of getting more oily or more dry. I also find this kind of formulation to be the one of the best as it never dries out my skin or leaves it more oily - it is all pros and no cons as far as skin health goes. The only problem is that it tends to just sit there, so despite being matte *looking*, my skin is never dry to the touch. This used to have awful packaging that broke over anything, but they’ve fixed it and it’s still readily available at Target in the US.\n\nSupergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is almost the same thing as the above but quite literally double the price. Same exact experience with both products tbh.\n\nBiore’s UV Kids Pure Milk Sunscreen SPF50 PA+++\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and consider it one of the best mineral sunscreens I’ve used. It obviously leaves a white cast, and this is an aspect I’ve made peace with. Ever since getting into skincare, my skin has been very white, anyway, so this has a strangely tone-evening effect for me. It tends to pill up on itself and will flake off throughout the day sometimes, but these are rare occasions - the cause of which I haven’t quite identified. It has a beautiful, milky texture, and makes your skin have this smooth and soft effect that I can’t quite describe. I find my skin always looks much better after using this and feels so effing smooth while I am taking it off with an oil cleanser. I consider it a treatment of sorts, to be honest. It has become such a staple for me since getting it that I can’t help but overlook some of its flaws.\n\nGlow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a great American sunscreen, and like the Zitsticka one, it is a hybrid sunscreen. This is far more noticeably here as you really do have to work it in to get rid of the cast, which makes sense since it has over quadruple the zinc oxide content. This truly does make you glow, though; and while I am not sure, it feels like there’s some kind of glittery material because it really does do the thing better than any other sunscreen on this list. I’d compare it to the Zitsticka sunscreen and the LRP one above in terms of glow as well as finish as this never becomes dry to the touch. This has fragrance in it, and to be honest it’s all the better for it. Combining the smell of sunscreen and watermelon was something I was so grateful to them for - they should sell it as a perfume.\n\nThe Ordinary’s UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants:\n\n3.25/5\n\nThis is fine, and I honestly don’t have much to say about it in their direction. It has a heavy white cast, which….. while we all know to expect that out of mineral sunscreens, this has a worse one than any of the others on this list, and has at the same time the lowest SPF rating. It even has a tint to it, so it’s just weird how white it goes on. This is a bit too drying for me, but the glow it provides is very specific. Like it is completely dry on your face, but looks like a highlighter it provides so much glow. I was hoping that since the ingredient list is so heavy on antioxidants and amino acids that this would be a cool upgrade to my Biore “treatment” sunscreen, but it is definitely a downgrade overall. It is so cheap, though, and it’s really not a bad product at all. If you have a whiter skin tone and have oily skin, I’d try this one out.\n\nI mentioned that I like my skin to look aggressively hydrated and glowy while also being dry to the touch. I am high maintenance - whatever. I am going to rank the top 5 in how well they achieve this effect on my skin while having no other disqualifying flaws.\n\n1. 9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n2. Skin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum\n3. iUNIK’s Centella Calming Daily Sunscreen\n4. Canmake’s Mermaid Gel UV Clear\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and have a lovely day!",

    "body": "Anyone on any form of social media knows about Lume Deodorant; their advertising is on point! I loved the catchy commercials, positive reviews, and had been using natural deodorants for years so I thought why the heck not?!? I've been using for 2+ months and felt it was time to write about my experience. I'm a big believer in honesty and transparency and my biggest criticism of this product/company is the inability to leave an unbiased review, even/especially if it's negative; the company never posted my less than stellar review on their website so I'm taking it to this forum. Underarms are skin too!\n\nI purchased the 3oz Lume Unscented Deodorant in the tube for $19USD. I've used it approximately 60x, pea sized amount per pit and I still have some left. It's vegan, cruelty-free, aluminum-free, and baking-soda fee. It's a mandelic acid based product. In the past I've used Schmidt's Original and Sensitive, Native, and an independent Etsy brand. All but Native worked well for odor but eventually they all irritated my pits to different degrees\n\n**PRO** \n\n* The first positive I will say is that it never irritated my pits, even directly after shaving. It's safe to use anywhere the gets stinky but I only have used on my underarms.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* DISHONEST PRACTICES As I mentioned before, I think the company promotes skewed product reviews by omitting critical reviews. This is not cool by me.\n* INEFFECTIVE- Guys, nobody wanted this product to work more than me. I don't have a strong body odor but my underarms will get stinky if I don't use anything. I don't care about getting sweaty (this is not an antiperspirant) but this really didn't work well to control odor. The company is very upfront that to use the product effectively, your clothes need to be treated first to wash off residual bacteria and residue from former products. I bought their recommended detergent and treated all my clothing as directed; nope, still stinky. I repeated the clothing treatments multiples times without results hoping it would work. At that point, I was past the 30 day return window. I bought a few new (washed) shirts and still experienced odor so I think the washing is kind of BS. Some days it would work better than others but it def didn't live up to the 72 hour odor control the company claims. It'll work well for a few hours but after that...phew. My body actually has a different, worse scent when I use this product. \n* \"UNSCENTED\"  is more like...old bananas. It mostly fades but kind of off-putting.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nWater, Mandelic Acid, Arrowroot Powder, Tapioca Starch, Isoamyl Laurate, Sodium Acrylate/ Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer, Caffeine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Theobroama Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Isohexadecane, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Sodium Lactate, Panthenol, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 60, Lecithin, Pullulan, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Silica, Fragrance\\*",

That's one thing I didn't like about Lume - they utilize pseudoscientific concepts like 'other deoderants trap toxins' and 'aluminum causes cancer' - both of which are untrue fear mongering. If you can't sell your product without using pseudoscience, its probably not all it's cracked up to be. \n\nAlso most deoderants don't use aluminum, antiperspirants do. So their advertising is also doing that dishonest thing where they declare their product free of something...implying that's a selling point because other products have the thing ... when they don't.",

Eventually I succumbed and bought a trial size. \n\nMy history? I'm typically a very sweaty person with strong B.O. and have used the highest level of deodorants and antiperspirants available in stores. I even had a pharmacist friend whip up a super strong spray-on liquid for me to use. \n\nEver since I started using Lume, I am virtually odorless. One application lasts more than a day in this Florida heat and humidity. I still sweat, but it doesn't smell. (It's not just my nose- I ask my husband and my siblings to check out of paranoia.) \n\nFor reference, I use the peach scent. I've used a couple others but didn't enjoy the smells. Lavender was slightly tolerable to me. It must differ from person to person, but this has been incredible.\n\nI'm usually ashamed and embarrassed when ads catch me, but I'm glad that I tried this and it's still working for me.",

I despise the lavendar sage scent - smells very 'geriatric' if that is a thing ....   I ordered various scents (clean tangerine, soft powder and toasted coconut).  I got a rash in my belly apron.   When I reported this to Lume, they basically told me that I was applying it wrong - shouldn't be applying it to wet skin (not sure how that works with their bath soap?), or that I was using too much - and sent me videos on proper application?  Ultimately, they told me that scent is a personal preference, and that they don't honour international refunds.  (I am in Canada).   Very disappointed.  I posted some critical reviews on their FB page, but after reading this, they likely too will be removed?    I DO NOT RECOMMEND.   Absolutely no satisfaction guarantee.",

Minimalist had used same formulation and just changed active. Basically 3 formulas --> 10 products. I had shared this is my stories \\[@avaale\\_\\]. Purely because I found it interesting. [Reproducing those stories here](https://imgur.com/a/rBAGL2Q), if you'd like to take a look.\n\nToday I decided to take a deeper look at the products, since I was getting comments like 'are you trying to say these products are useless?'.  And I had too cursory an examination to be comfortable saying it's good or bad. The Minimalist had outdone themselves with transparency and even mentioned supplier details, for every main active. (Not being sarcastic, I'm genuinely in awe, that they did this, while have the Indian skincare world refuses to declare full list of ingredients).\n\nStarted with\n\n# Vitamin C 20% (SAP) + Ferulic Acid\n\nThey had sourced the SAP from [BASF.](https://www.basf.com/in/en.html) Searching for details on their SAP, I found [this.](http://www.dr-baumann-international.co.uk/science/BASF%20Vitamin%20C.pdf) The technical information sheet for SAP from BASF itself.\n\nA few things stand out.\n\n* The technical info sheet says SAP is **most stable at pH values above 6.5.** [Pubchem compound summary](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sodium-ascorbate) agrees.  **However the Minimalist site claims that the product is at a pH of 3.5**\n* Now according to the same BASF technical sheet, at pH 3 (details on 3.5 was not provided) , stability falls from 100 to 10 in 60 days. Where as from PH 5 to 7 stability wavers at 90 to 100 till 120 days. Stability at various pHs were tested at 40C\n* Next the ferulic acid. LAA which is a highly unstable form of Vitamin C is usually formulated with ferulic acid to increase stability. All studies I found tested LAA & ferulic acid  [\\[1\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16185284/), [\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4536008/), [\\[3\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18603326/).  But Ferulic acid as an ingredient does have anti-oxidant properties and is a effective scavenger of free radicals, which could be a reason it was added. Just looking at ferulic acid, [this article](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/491755) states that it penetrates the stratum corneum in at both pH 3 as well 7.2. So it should still work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Salicylic Acid 2%\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with* [Curcylic 40](https://www.vantagegrp.com/en-US/Product/Page/ea60363a-7c2a-4907-b245-a763f0475c50/Curcylic-40) *(SA) based on advanced pre-solubilized technology from* [Vantage](https://www.vantagegrp.com/webforward/home)*, US, a global natural chemistry company\"*\n\nNow the INCI name for [Curcylic 40](https://www.cosmeticingredients.co.uk/ingredient/curcylic%C2%AE-40) is Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine & Salicylic acid. As u/Aayu07 pointed out in her Insta stories \"Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine\" part is not mentioned [in the Minimalist website](https://beminimalist.co/products/salicylic-acid-2) at all. I assume they're writing the whole thing SA.\n\nIf you check out [Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-dimethylamine) in Incidecoder.  It not only talks about [Curcylic 40](http://www.lipochemicals.com/products/curcylic-40), but also rather helpfully shows us other products with this ingredient, one of which happens to be [The Ordinary Salicylic 2%](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution) & [The Ordinary Aha 30% + Bha 2% Peeling Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution-2).  The ordinary does mention [Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-dimethylamine) in [their ingredients list](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-salicylic-acid-2pct-solution-30ml?_ga=2.87650074.34031488.1600610763-39495863.1600610763) by the way. So for[2%, they basically have 5%](https://www.theformulary.co.uk/product/curcylic-40-water-soluble-salicylic-acid/) Curcylic 40 and pH is supposed to be between 3 and 8.  But pH of this product is not mentioned on the minimalist site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Retinol 2%\n\nFrom the site *\"Contains top quality Granactive Retinoid sourced from* [Grant Industries](https://www.grantinc.com/)*, USA, A leading global supplier in skincare\"*\n\nThe granactive retinoid, they're sourcing from Grant has the [iNCI name Dimethyl Isosorbide (and) Hydroxyp­inacolone Retinoate](https://cdn.thomasnet.com/ccp/00654679/98240.pdf). Which they've split up, maybe due to percentages of concentration. The ordinary did this too.\n\nI found this [list of actives and briefs about them](https://cdn.thomasnet.com/ccp/00654679/98240.pdf) from Grant Industries. Where they mention [these results.](https://imgur.com/Pf6meSk.jpg)\n\n[INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxypinacolone-retinoate) also provides a summary of the ingredient itself and results from manufacturer's tests and results from Estee Lauder comparitive in-vitro study between Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, [tretinoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tretinoin), good old [retinol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinol) and [retinyl palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinyl-palmitate) in collagen boosting effectiveness.\n\nTheir bottomline \"*We are really happy to see some innovation happening with retinoids, and we think* ***Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate is a super promising rising star, but it’s not fully proven yet.*** *If you are someone who likes to experiment and try out the newest things, grab your running shoes and try some HPR containing serum now (see product list below :)). If you like the tried and true, however, stick to* [*retinol*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinol) *and* [*tretinoin*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tretinoin) *for now and re-examine the question in a couple of years when (hopefully) more research will be available. \"*\n\nManufacturer recommends [upper limit use of 1%](https://imgur.com/Pf6meSk.jpg). This is where retinol comes in I'm guessing. For the other 1% or more. This is the same combination The ordinary uses in their [Granactive retinoid 2% emulsion](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-advanced-retinoid-2pct-30ml).\n\nAlso the other products using this ingredient in Incidecoder is a who's who of brands.\n\n* Sunday Riley A+ High Dose Retinoid Serum\n* Peter Thomas RothProfessional Strength 3% Retinoid Plus\n* Dr. Sam Bunting SkincareFlawless Nightly Serum\n* The Inkey List  Retinol Serum\n* And even surprisingly [Revolution Skincare](https://incidecoder.com/brands/revolution-skincare)Skin Tone Correcting Serum – Granactive Retinoid 2%\n* and much much more.\n\nThe [science behind this product](https://beminimalist.co/products/retinol-2) on the Minimalist website, speaks pretty much only about the granactive retinoid, even though the product is called Retinol 2%. Retinol and Retinoic acid esters are not the same and don't work exactly the same way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Niacinamide 10% + Zinc\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with Niacinamide USP Grade (US Pharmacopeia approved) by* [Lonza, Switzerland](https://www.lonza.com/)*, a leading global supplier of Vitamin B3 for over 40 years\"*\n\n[Lonza is definitely big into Niacinamide](https://www.efeedlink.com/search/?q=lonza&q=lonza), and a well known legit supplier.\n\nBut onto more relevant information, I did find this [data sheet from Lonza](https://dermagist.com/shop/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/niacinamide-sheet.pdf) with briefs on a few efficacy studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hyaluronic Acid 2% + Vitamin B5\n\nFrom the site *\"The key ingredient is sourced from* [Royal DSM, Netherlands](https://www.dsm.com/corporate/home.html)*; a global science-based company ranked in Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations 2020\"*\n\nBare bones [Data Sheet of Hyaluronic Acid](https://www.essence-plus.com/essence-plus689/program_download/good/201611081542182368.pdf) from manufacturer.\n\nBare bones [Data sheet of Panthenol,](http://technicaldocuments.dsm.com/product_finder/technical_documents/DNP/level10/DNP_DNPNA_000000000000413852_PDS_en.pdf?&&ACSew=ApplicationDataSheet) from Royal DSM. But I'm not sure if they're sourcing this from them too. One thing though, if they're sourcing ingredient from here pH of 5% solution in water is 9 to 10.5. Now the panthenol is probably lesser than 2% since hyaluronic acid is listed first (this is an assumption since Indian companies don't really care about listing in order of %).\n\nI'm not sure how relevant this is but pH of hyaluronic acid is 6 to 7 according to the data sheet. Panthenol is 9 to 10.5. This is a serum that I originally assumed for pH balanced. But the [incidecoder](https://imgur.com/VgOAZJ1.jpg) lists no [buffering](https://incidecoder.com/ingredient-functions/buffering) agent. [Skincarisma](http://www.skincarisma.com/products/analyze?utf8=%E2%9C%93&product%5Bingredient%5D=Aloe+Vera+Juice%2C+Dimethyl+Isosorbide%2C+Sodium+Hyaluronate%2C+Propanediol%2C+Ethoxydiglycol%2C+Panthenol%2C+Phenoxyethanol%2C+Pullulan%2C+Ethylhexylglycerin%2C+Hydroxyethylcellulose%2C+Xanthan+Gum%2C+Sclerotium+Gum%2C+Trisodium+Ethylenediamine+Disuccinate%2C+Lecithin) doesn't mention a pH adjuster either. So I'm very curious to see what the actual pH of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: I'm not a cosmetic formulator and while I roughly know ingredient purposes, I've no idea how all the ingredients would interact with each other and affect the pH. Which why I started this with 'I'm not sure, how relevant this is'.**\n\nI did ask a friend who purchased this product to check pH and if or when she gets back to me, I'll update this accordingly.\n\nAlso while the science behind the products had this to say *'Not all topical Hyaluronic acid serums are equally effective as the molecular size of HA determines the depth of its delivery in the skin. The smaller the molecule size, the deeper it penetrates the dermis. Larger-molecule size HA stays at the epidermis and provides surface hydration only.'*  The data sheet attached above mentions a molecular mass of 1.6 MDa. This is [middle molecular weight](https://www.nayaglow.com/2019/04/30/hyaluronic-acid-explained/).\n\nSo is this inherently bad? Not necessarily, as ecowell explains in detail in [this post.](https://www.theecowell.com/blog/hyaluronicacid) All sources are cited. Also [this](https://madridge.org/journal-of-chemistry-and-research/ijcr-1000103.pdf).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Lactic Acid 10% + Hyaluronic Acid 2%\n\nFrom the site \"*Formulated with natural and pure ingredients sourced from leading global suppliers such as* [Corbion](http://www.corbion.com/) *and Royal DSM, Netherlands\"*\n\nI think we can safely assume that HA in this product is sourced from Royal DSM. And I've already gone in-depth into it above. So directly onto, lactic acid. And we have the data sheet [here](https://www.corbion.com/static/downloads/datasheets/56pdf/pds-purac%20hs%2088%20(0406).pdf). Nothing that alarms me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kojic Acid 2% + Alpha Arbutin 1%\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with the most stable form of kojic acid, Kojic Dipalmitate, sourced from* [Alpha Environmental](https://www.alpha-environmental.com/)*, USA, a leading global supplier\"*\n\nI found nothing. Zilch. Not even a info page on their own site. Just a [listing](https://www.alpha-environmental.com/products.html) that shows they sell both Kojic Acid Dipalmitate as well as Alpha arbutin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# AHA 30% + BHA 2%\n\nFrom the site \" *All ingredients are sourced from leading global suppliers such as Fortune 500 Chemours Company, USA, and Vantage, US\"*\n\nSince we already BHA is [Curcylic 40](https://www.cosmeticingredients.co.uk/ingredient/curcylic%C2%AE-40) ie Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine & Salicylic acid, and it's been analysed above, I'm moving on the AHAs.\n\nChemours offers a variety of [Glycolic Acid products](https://www.chemours.com/en/brands-and-products/glycolic-acid) for different purposes. Their [Glypure TM](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-cosmetic-grade-glycolic-acid-brochure.pdf) range which comes in 3 variants are our best bet and Glypure GL which is glycolide, the cyclic diester of glycolic acid. I found a lot of information\n\n* [Technical Spec](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-70-spec-sheet.pdf) and [Material Safety Data Sheet](https://www.3eonline.com/ImageServer/ImageViewer.aspx?id=3Q%2FfAR8ne%2FvPh6syVnSymkS%2BBDo8OjmbVocxRCMEgeH9DOXp3rOno2bBstgZQVl6ddB5zxzJXIW7nbmF5mKrdg%3D%3D) for Glypure 70\n* [Technical Spec](https://cms.chempoint.com/ChemPoint/media/ChemPointSiteMedia/PDF%20Docs/C-10269_Glypure_99_specsheet_1.pdf) and a [2017 MSDS](https://cms.chempoint.com/ChemPoint/media/ChemPointSiteMedia/PDF%20Docs/Glypure-99-SDS-_1.pdf) for Glypure 99\n* [Product Information](https://www.in-cosmetics.com/__novadocuments/670288?v=637172315377900000) of Glypure GL\n* [Brochure](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-glycolic-acid-sell-sheet.pdf) with manufacturer studies and much more that I'm not adding here.\n\nHowever very little on Glypure™ Preneutralized which I feel is the actual product used. All we know about this is \"• Pre-neutralized Glypure™ is an aqueous solution neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. It is available in a variety of pH levels—2.25, 3.25, 3.8, 4.0, 4.4—as well as custom pH.\"\n\nIncase I'm mistaken I'm leaving other info attached above.\n\nLogically lactic is probably from [Corbion](http://www.corbion.com/) (which is not mentioned) and BHA from [Vantage](https://www.vantagegrp.com/webforward/home), which is mentioned.\n\nI found no mention of mandelic acid in both Chemours and Vantage's sites. I've no clue where it's sourced from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Apple Cider Vinegar 2% + Glycolic Acid 10%\n\nFrom the site \"*It is formulated with high-grade ingredients sourced from a Fortune 500 company, Chemours, USA\"*\n\nThis obviously refers to Glycolic Acid as discussed above. No idea about source of ACV.\n\nBut Neemli and Minimalist, 2 brands recently picked this combo to formulate products with. So I had a cursory glance at studies and found [this one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31328306/) where \"*A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic acid) and the other in water 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment*.\" Conclusion: Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin barrier integrity but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects.\n\nNeemli's site did mention this *\"A natural astringent, Apple Cider Vinegar helps increase the blood flow to the skin, minimizing the appearance of pores. It also helps balance the skin’s pH to keep it functioning optimally and fighting acne-causing bacteria.\"* as the reason it was added.\n\nI'll have to look into this deeper later, but for now, this combination baffles me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Benzoyl Peroxide 2% + Glycolic Acid 5%\n\nFrom the site *\"Contains top quality ingredients sourced from Vantage Specialty, USA, ranked in the top 30% of the most sustainable companies in the world by EcoVadis\"*\n\nAnd we're back to Vantage. Glycolic Acid has to be from Chemours. so the BP is from Vantage.\n\nVantage markets BP as [Curoxyl 42](https://www.vantagegrp.com/en-US/Product/Page/65ea0c11-a095-463f-a102-a19ccd2ae9bb/Curoxyl-42). The INCI name is Aqua & Benzoyl peroxide. Found the [brochure](https://pdfhost.io/v/lWMc.doh5_PowerPoint_Presentation.pdf) and I find this product quite intriguing since they claim that it's a *\"aqueous based, micronized benzoyl peroxide dispersion (40%) in the form of a gel that can replace traditional BPO due to its low irritation profile\"* while normally I find BP quite irritating.\n\nNo mention of pH on the site, while Bp is supposedly 4.8 to 6.6. And glycolic acid traditionally potent at much a lower pH. This study on glycolic acid's  antibacterial activity against *C. acnes* found it [most potent at 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64545-9), while it did kill C.acnes upto 4.5. Less efficient killing was found at pH 5.\n\nSo I'm curious about the pH of this product too.\n\n# \n\n# My thoughts\n\n* I didn't find anything supporting or refuting Consumer testing results that's stated on the website.\n* I'm most excited for Retinol 2%, since The granactive retinoid emulsion was my love before I was prescribed Adapalene and Tret.\n* All in all, while the company has indulged in lesser than savoury practices regarding packaging and I'm not certain about the research they did into ingredients / formulation themselves or their passion for skincare, I do believe that they maybe better than a lot of indie brands out there.\n* A insta video by a popular beauty editor who was talking about the minimalist had been shared with me. They had said some sourcing seems legit and others shady. While sources for ACV and mandelic acid was not revealed, all others seem to be legit. I found no shadiness, let me know if you've found any.\n* Products that don't quite convince me / I still have doubts about are\n\n1. Vitamin C 20% (SAP) + Ferulic Acid  (pH reasons)\n2. Benzoyl Peroxide 2% + Glycolic Acid 5%  (pH reasons)\n3. Apple Cider Vinegar 2% + Glycolic Acid 10%  (combination)\n4. Hyaluronic Acid 2% + Vitamin B5  (pH reasons)\n5. Kojic Acid 2% + Alpha Arbutin 1% (no details, no idea what to think)\n\n* The actual results and efficacy is yet to be seen, and I'll personally primarily judge them on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso speaking about popular bloggers / influencers, a lot of info about minimalist that's been going around in social media is clearly from this sub.\n\nAs you guys know this is a completely non-profit platform that we're using to educate ourselves and others, the other contributors and I gain nothing from doing all this research and sharing it, And while I have no problems with people sharing and using this information, I do wish credit is given where credit is due. And if you're asking \"how do we credit? you're anonmyous\", u/Aayu07 and I both started Instagram handles. Well she has had hers for years. I started it because she wanted to credit me for sharing some glycolic acid stuff. And I'd appreciate it if you credit me if you use this information anywhere. Just DM me or u/Aayu07 or any other user here to find out whether they wanted to be credited. Basic courtesy guys. For instance u/kparwal and u/e-lusion were also credited when u/Aayu07 used their findings.\n\nJust to be clear, ***\"I*** ***do not*** ***consent to this post or any part of it being reposted on any social media (including but not limited to YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat).

Because the Ordinary entered a market that was pretty saturated, and the Indian market is STARVED of basic formulations. \n\nI DO wish they'd use INCI names for their ingredients, because the Derma Essentia moisturizer used a proprietary name for their emulsifier, and I was so excited, I only found out later that Polysorbate 20 was in there... Not fungal safe 😐. But I'm glad these products ARE minimal! \n\n...

Glycolic acid is pretty strong in itself, what's the need to pair itwith ACV? which isn't shown to be much beneficial for skin.\n\nHaving said that I'm waiting anxiously for product reviews.",

I had clear skin, then I broke my skin barrier in the spring by using products that were too harsh (too many exfoliants). I compensated by slapping on anything I saw on tiktok, using dozens of products to save my barrier. Then I was stuck with closed comedones and itchy, textured skin with constant breakouts.\n\nI couldn't figure out why. So I started eliminating things. I saw a post on here where someone cut out silicones, because they had skin like this. My makeup had silicones in it, as did many of my products. I stopped EVERYTHING except:\n\n1) La Roche Posay Tolerance Hydrating Facial Cleanser (1x a day at night)\n2) Inkey List PHA Toner with cotton pads (gentle swiping morning and night)\n3) Cosrx Green Tea Soothing Gel Cream (to calm redness and soothe skin twice a day, no pore clogging ingredients!!)\n4) Panthenol Re-Barrier Cream (twice a day) seriously my holy Grail moisturizer (and I've tried a LOT)\n5) CeraVe Retinol Serum (every few days on my trouble areas only)\n6) Hero Rescue Balm (on fresh/exposed breakouts)\n\nMy barrier is healed. My acne is gone. My texture cleared is getting smoother (you can still see little bumps). And I stopped picking at it!! 🤦‍♀️Check your products for silicone, it might be what's getting you too! I hate that I had to stop sunscreen but it was breaking me out like crazy wearing it every day. Anyone with similar skin issues to me, please drop those sunscreen recommendations 🙏",

This is the cream I keep in my bags for after swimming or when my skin feels dry and I love the texture! It’s fragrance and EO free and has panthenol glycerine and the proper amount of niacinamide. I know some people don’t tolerate niacinamide but it’s not an issue for me. I don’t love hyalauronic acid the way a lot of people do, but I think the glycerin balances it all out nicely. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a cream in the ~$15 range",

It also lasts long even if I have oily and pawisin skin. I got them in the shades \"Make a Mauve\" and \"Cheeky Coral\".\n\n**Squad Cosmetics Celestial Eyes Eyeshadow Palette** - I haven't tried it yet\n\n**Luxe Organix Panthenol Therapy 24h Lip Serum** - I love this! I know this is meant for lip prep but I use it as an actual lippie because it's so glossy, may onting tint, and it makes my lips so soft.\n\n**Koji eyelash curler** - This is literally the perfect shape for my eyes. Hindi niya napipinch yung eyelids and lashes ko. Tayong-tayo yung lashes ko when I use this, and it holds the curl for the whole day if paired with a good mascara. I used to use a curler from Paulash before I has this, their shapes are similar, Koji is just more curved.\n\n**Fashion21 Double Up Mascara** - My HG mascara! I will always buy this. It's so lengthening, it holds my curl for a decent amount of hours (not the whole day), it's tubing so it's easy to remove, and it's very affordable.\n\n**Romand Juicy Lasting Tint** - Romand's JLT is my favorite lippie formula kaya I bought another shade, I got the shade \"#37 Mellow Pear\". This is so perfect as an everyday lippie. It's an mlbb shade once applied, it oxidizes naman to a natural looking pink after awhile.\n\n**Nature Lip Gloss** - Lol I don't like the formula. It's glossy and it's not heavy, but it's just soooo drying pag nagtagal sa lips.",

    "body": "Finally I get to share mine! It might be relevant to know that I’m in my 20s, have rather fair skin with an olive undertone and a combination type :) Please let me know if you have any questions or want to share your experience with these products!\n\n1. Mixa Panthenol Comfort Body Balm, ~4€Great lightweight formula, no fragrance. I have been using this for roughly 3 years and  after finishing the last bottle, wanted to try something new. But now I’m glad to have finished the other lotion I had, because I can finally use this Mixa one again! It provides care for an entire day and I especially love it for my face. You can also get it in a smaller tube, but it’s literally the same formula, just different packaging and almost double the price per 100ml. I have also tried their other versions orange, blue and pink, but I didn’t really like them, especially the blue one was very streaky and sticky. \n\n2. Balea Ultra Sensitive Waschgel, ~3€Another longtime-favorite of mine. Very simple but does a great job, even with waterproof makeup (after makeup remover). I think it’s often unnecessary to use fancy cleansers, and prefer to have my active ingredients in the form of serums or lotions. This one doesn’t contain any fragrance.\n\n3. Sundance Sensitive Sonnencreme 50, ~4€The formula is rather oily and very rich, but I love the glow it gives me and it doesn’t leave any white residue on my skin. It also works great as a primer/base. Obviously I need to properly wash my face after wearing it, otherwise my pores might get clogged. But for me, that’s the case with most sunscreens! I use it on my face and body. It’s fragrance-free, as well.\n\n4. Trend it up! Lip stain (~3€) & Dewy cream blush (~3€)The Lip stain looks very vibrant when initially applying it, but I usually leave it on for 10-20minutes and then wipe the residue off with a wet cotton pad. It gives a nice natural colour, not too intense. I have also tried it for my cheeks, but unfortunately it doesn’t blend very well so it’ll look patchy. The cream blush is in the shade 010 and not insanely pigmented, but gives a good glow and the colour suits me well. Easy to apply! \n\n5. Trend it up! Slim line brow definer waterproof, ~4€ A simple, ashy brow pen with a thin tip. I don’t know the shade number, but it’s an ashy brown and definitely not orange. I prefer this over any other other drug store eyebrow product, because they usually look kinda orange. The added spoolie is also a nice touch. It’s not quite waterproof, which is totally fair for the price imo. Also the product itself lasts quite long (at least 4 weeks of daily use).\n\n6. Balea anti Pickel patches, ~2,50€ for 32 patchesAnother longtime favourite of mine! There are two different sizes in each pack. I recommend applying an alcohol based disinfectant before applying, to make sure they stick well. I haven’t tried any of the more expensive versions like mighty patch, but I’ll just _stick_ with these ones :)) \n7. DontoDent Electric Toothbrush, ~30€ \nThis is already my second one (I had the same one for 3 years but it broke, which is totally fine for the price) and I could never go back to a manual one! It’s so much easier and the feeling of smooth teeth after using this is amazing. They also have replacement brushes which are way cheaper than the ones by Braun or Phillips. It comes with a charger, too. ",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nI am going to review as many sunscreens as I can based on the many I have tried over the years. This is going to be a long one, but it is because I want to be specific and give as many relevant details as possible. I have normal skin I’d say with combo tendencies - I live in a climate that has super dry winters and really humid summers, so I change my routine a lot over the year. I also used to work a job that gave me a bunch of rewards to use online from contest winnings, and I used them all to explore Asian Beauty lol. Shoutout to r/AsianBeauty btw!\n\nMy AM routine is as follows:\n\n1. Toner pad (been using Rael Beauty’s pads with Peach Slice’s BHA, Jumiso’s PHA, and Cerave’s Hydrating Toner)\n2. One Thing’s 10% Niacinamide Toner\n3. Peach Slice’s Snail Rescue Blemish Busting Toner with added glycerin\n4. The Ordinary’s NMF + Beta Glucan\n5. iUNIK’s Centella Calming Daily Sunscreen\n\nMy PM routine:\n\n1. ma:nyo’s Pure Cleansing Oil\n2. Allies of Skin Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser\n3. Cerave’s Hydrating Toner\n4. ma:nyo’s Bifida Complex Ampoule with added niacinamide\n5. Illiyoon’s Ceramide ATO Soothing Gel \n6. The Ordinary’s NMF + Phytoceramides\n\nI am going to rate each on a scale of 1-5, and will discuss what I liked or disliked. I tend to like sunscreens that dry down to a hydrated yet dry-to-the-touch finish, don’t become more oily or provoke dryness throughout the day, don’t leave a white cast, don’t have fragrance or alcohol, and don’t clog pores. I am going to vaguely say something has an impressive ingredient list a few times, so I will briefly list some ingredients I look for:\n\n1. Preference on hybrid sunscreens\n2. B vitamins, primarily panthenol and niacinamide\n3. Ceramides\n4. Antioxidant- or generally nutrient-heavy, non-fragrant extracts like centella asiatica, broccoli, pine, etc.\n5. Antioxidants like vitamins C and E; ferulic acid, etc.\n6. Peptides\n7. Silicones are my arch nemesis, but they are so commonly used in sunscreens that I don't get too upset\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a hard one for me, because it is truly one of my go-to’s in the winter time and I have a weird affinity for it. It is surprisingly emollient to the point where I was glowing all day even in the driest of winters. This is only dry to the touch in super dry weather; but it leaves you with such a hydrated and healthy glow that I can’t complain about it. This, at the same time, is a tricky one to recommend for dry climates because of its HA contents. For some, hyaluronic acid is a loss-heavy hydrator if not sealed in, and since this is the last step, it’s difficult to recommend it. I personally love it, though! It has such an amazing smell (I love sunscreen smell don’t @ me) and I just love its texture. Its ingredient list is a genuine humble brag, as well.\n\nSkin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50 PA++++\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis, to me, is like an upgrade of the Isntree sunscreen. It is surprisingly similar to me in terms of ingredients and texture, but it dries down rather immediately. It keeps my skin very moisturized and hydrated, leaving a nice hydrated finish that doesn’t get oilier throughout the day. I worry this will dry me out in the winter, but in the currently very humid summer I have been going to this one more and more often.\n\nCanmake’s Mermaid Gel UV SPF50+ PA++++ Clear\n\n4.25/10\n\nThis is a classic for a reason, and it was my first AB sunscreen that I tried. It has no white cast, has a neat little smell, and it is surprisingly moisturizing for a sunscreen that dries down to a dewy yet try to the touch finish. This will always be a go-to, but I don’t like wearing it in the winter because it will dry out my skin and lead to some oily redness on my forehead. Perfect for the summer, as well as any day that it’s not oppressively dry. It has an amazing ingredient list, as well. My main issue is that it pills very easily - more so than any other sunscreen I’ve used. It’s just weird to me that it’s made by a makeup company and they couldn’t nail that part down haha.\n\n[iUNIK’s Centella Soothing Sun Cream](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/woly4y/iuniks_new_centella_calming_daily_sunscreen_review/)\n\n9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n\n5/5\n\nThis is remarkably similar to Canmake’ sunscreen for me. I find that it has a very similar texture, but instead of the yellow tinted color, it’s a bit green. It ends up being a bit whiter as you rub it in, as well. This is a genuinely impressive ingredient list as far as extracts go, with pine of course being at the forefront. I love how antioxidant heavy it is, but I also think it dries down to this lovely, glassy finish. I prefer it over Canmake’s because of its more specialized ingredient list and lack of anecdotal pilling. The finish is just so silky smooth and healthy - I am a huge fan of this one.\n\nLa Roche Posay’s Anthelios UV Correct SPF 70\n\n4/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and if it weren’t so emollient it would be a 5/5. This is literally an SPF 70, but goes onto the face as if it were clear. I would say that apart from invisible sunscreens, this has the most immediately clear cast I’ve ever seen. It’s very thick, and smells violently of La Roche Posay sunscreen - that is to say amazing. It leaves your skin (and especially your pores) looking vehemently healthy, as if you’re actually eating your vegetables. The one problem is that it is too moisturizing for humid climates and will leave a layer on your skin even when you just apply a little. I haven’t had issues with clogged pores, but I do prefer to have my skin be dry to the touch. This also will make my face a bit dry and itchy as the day goes on, so I deducted a bit for that.\n\nPipette’s Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n2/5\n\nThis is a no-go for me. It’s too moisturizing for a mineral sunscreen in my opinion, which may get a lot of people who enjoy it for that reason. This sunscreen bugs me because it advertises to people of color and brags about having no white cast when it is literally an SPF 50 Zinc-only sunscreen. Don’t lie, man. And it is a lie - while this has one of the tamest white casts I’ve seen on a sunscreen of its prior description, it is still basically white paint. It also stings when I use it, which almost never happens with sunscreens for me. It’s literally made for babies. It’s an amazing body sunscreen, but considering how much I love this brand, I have a mini beef with this product.\n\nBiossance’s Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis is fine - very similar to the above with less of a white cast and less of a chance to burn my skin. It is almost the same formulation as they have the same parent company. It is just super overpriced and virtually the same as a much cheaper product.\n\nZitsticka’s MEGASHADE Breakout-proof SPF 50 Serum\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a top tier sunscreen, and I am surprised I have never really seen it mentioned online. It has a stunning ingredient list (truly… amazing), and it’s one of the only hybrid American sunscreens I’ve seen. It’s also very widely available, but has small packaging at a hefty price tag. The smell is amazing as far as sunscreens go (again I love the smell of sunscreens), and it has a very white color that goes away pretty quickly. It is a liquid sunscreen that comes in a serum bottle with a dropper. Because of it being a liquid, I find it sometimes difficult to disperse as it doesn’t quite sink in, or rather have the sensation of sinking in like other, thicker sunscreens have. It stays true to its breakout-proof promise, but I find that it isn’t dry to the touch and will get progressively oilier throughout the day. It makes your pores look super healthy, and gives you a hydrated, dewy finish, though!\n\nEtude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4.25/5\n\nI love this one, and got it at a really decent price on sale recently. It is thoroughly moisturizing, has an interesting creamy texture I don’t see often, and has no white cast. When it is on your skin and needs to be rubbed in, it’s already basically clear. Once on, it dries down and leaves no visible oiliness at all, seemingly right off the bat; while leaving my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout most of the day. I’ve noticed this has a tendency to dry out my skin as I get towards the end of the day, though, so I am giving it a 4.25/5 despite it checking almost every box.\n\nBlack Girl Sunscreen’s Make It Matte SPF 45\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a dupe of the Unseen Sunscreen with a more basic ingredient list. I see this as a good thing, though. This kind of sunscreen is popular for a very good reason - it is visibly mattifying while also pulling off the cool feat of being completely clear. It is very moisturizing, and I’ve never experienced any issues after wearing it throughout the day of getting more oily or more dry. I also find this kind of formulation to be the one of the best as it never dries out my skin or leaves it more oily - it is all pros and no cons as far as skin health goes. The only problem is that it tends to just sit there, so despite being matte looking, my skin is never dry to the touch. This used to have awful packaging that broke over anything, but they’ve fixed it and it’s still readily available at Target in the US.\n\nSupergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is almost the same thing as the above but quite literally double the price with unnecessary added ingredients. Same exact experience with both products tbh.\n\nBiore’s UV Kids Pure Milk Sunscreen SPF50 PA+++\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and consider it one of the best mineral sunscreens I’ve used. It obviously leaves a white cast, and this is an aspect I’ve made peace with. Ever since getting into skincare, my skin has been very white, anyway, so this has a strangely tone-evening effect for me. It tends to pill up on itself and will flake off throughout the day sometimes, but these are rare occasions - the cause of which I haven’t quite identified. It has a beautiful, milky texture, and makes your skin have this smooth and soft effect that I can’t quite describe. I find my skin always looks much better after using this and feels so effing smooth while I am taking it off with an oil cleanser. I consider it a treatment of sorts, to be honest. It has become such a staple for me since getting it that I can’t help but overlook some of its flaws.\n\nGlow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a great American sunscreen, and like the Zitsticka one, it is a hybrid sunscreen. This is far more noticeably here as you really do have to work it in to get rid of the cast, which makes sense since it has over quadruple the zinc oxide content. This truly does make you glow, though; and while I am not sure, it feels like there’s some kind of glittery material because it really does do the thing better than any other sunscreen on this list. I’d compare it to the Zitsticka sunscreen and the LRP one above in terms of glow as well as finish as this never becomes dry to the touch. This has fragrance in it, and to be honest it’s all the better for it. Combining the smell of sunscreen and watermelon was something I was so grateful to them for - they should sell it as a perfume.\n\nThe Ordinary’s UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants:\n\n3.25/5\n\nThis is fine, and I honestly don’t have much to say about it in their direction. It has a heavy white cast, which….. while we all know to expect that out of mineral sunscreens, this has a worse one than any of the others on this list, and has at the same time the lowest SPF rating. It even has a tint to it, so it’s just weird how white it goes on. This is a bit too drying for me, but the glow it provides is very specific. Like it is completely dry on your face, but looks like a highlighter it provides so much glow. I was hoping that since the ingredient list is so heavy on antioxidants and amino acids that this would be a cool upgrade to my Biore “treatment” sunscreen, but it is definitely a downgrade overall. It is so cheap, though, and it’s really not a bad product at all. If you have a whiter skin tone and have oily skin, I’d try this one out.\n\nBeauty of Joseon:\n\n3.25/5\n\nI am a decently big fan of this brand, but I have had hang ups on every product I have tried. It is usually the packaging, but this product has beautiful and easy-to-use packaging that makes sense. This sunscreen reminds me of Etude’s Director Moisture Sunscreen in the way that it spreads - it’s like using a moisturizer. It has no visible white pigment and has a gorgeous, silky texture. It smells heavily like sunscreen in a way that I can’t appreciate, and I am a massive appreciator of the typical sunscreen smell. The ingredient list has a lovely buffet of probiotic extracts and a really impressive 30% rice extract - I feel like it’s super rare to see sunscreens with concentrations that high of anything. My issue with this sunscreen was the breakout of closed comedones I would get every time I used it, but I truly think this is a person to person thing, and I completely understand why this is everyone’s holy grail. In addition to the texture, spreadability, and lack of white pigment; this also dries down really well with a natural, but not quite matte finish. If you don’t react to this, this would be a go-to for so many. I have given thought to it being the fermented ingredients in this that ended up giving me the breakout, but I am not typically sensitive to these ingredients anymore. It also contains a silicone (caprylyl methicone), but it’s low enough on the ingredient list that I’m not sure that would be the concern either. Either way, I hesitantly recommend this one, but it didn’t work for me. :)\n\nPurito’s Daily Go-to Sunscreen \n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a sunscreen that I would never wear to anything important because of how dewy its finish is, but I do wear it on days where my skin is super dry. I find this one keeps my skin hydrated better and longer than any other sunscreen with no closed comedones or itchiness. The ingredient list is super basic with centella and all of its derivatives being the highlights of the list, and I think the simplicity of it is one of the reasons it’s so effective at hydrating and soothing the skin. It does take a bit of rubbing in to fully disperse the pigment, but it doesn’t end up leaving a white cast on my (admittedly very white) skin. It has a faint smell that I can’t really describe - it’s very similar to the iUNIK sunscreen in that they clearly tried to go for the scentless product that ends up smelling like raw ingredients. I’m not too sure if I will end up repurchasing this because Isntree’s HA SPF 50 sunscreen has a similar but better effect on my skin, but I would recommend it to someone with dry skin who has sensitivity to hyaluronic acid over that.\n\nThe Inkey List's Polyglutamic Acid Dewy Sunscreen SPF 30\n\n1/5\n\nThis brand, man. They continue to use packaging that is not only bad to look at, but also super difficult to use. Once you get halfway through any product you've bought from them in a tube, I wish you luck. It's genuinely baffling that they still manufacture these exact same tubes. The product itself such a misfire, as well - it is facial desert in a bottle, doesn't hydrate, and is difficult to work into the skin. When your product instantly dries on contact but is also difficult to work into the skin, you get a lot of rubbing. The pigment that is so difficult to spread doesn't even appear to be from the sunscreen agent, either - it is streaky like an emulsion gone wrong. I've never had a sunscreen have so many struggles, to be honest. How did they get to Sephora? Why did I buy this? On the day it came out? Keep me in your prayers. \n\nI mentioned that I like my skin to look aggressively hydrated and glowy while also being dry to the touch. I am high maintenance - whatever. I am going to rank the top 5 in how well they achieve this effect on my skin while having no other disqualifying flaws.\n\n1. 9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n2. Skin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum\n3. Etude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream\n4. Canmake’s Mermaid Gel UV Clear\n5. iUNIK’s Centella Calming Daily Sunscreen\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and have a lovely day!",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\n🌟 **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\n🌟 **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\n🌟 **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\n🌟 **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\n🌟  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\n🌟 **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed! i'll also leave my current routine in the comments below, for those who may be interested. i hope this was of some help to y'all :-), and that all of you would have good health during this period!",

    "body": "🙇🏻‍♀️ **Skin background:**\n\n\nDry, sensitive skin. Acne, fungal acne and eczema prone. Easily congested.\nI have PIE and redness, but I don't have much dark spots or discoloration (aside from what's left behind after eczema flared ups) \n\nAlso I live in a dry, hot climate where the sun is really harsh.\n\n\n📈 **About the charts (slide 2 and 3)**:\n\n\n0 means least of the \"title\" and 5 means most of the \"title\"; like \"thickness\" is rated 1 means it's not a thick toner, and is really watery.\n\n\n🧴 **Coming to the product:**\n\n\n- Name: Skin1004 madagascar centella tone brightening boosting toner.\n\n- Period of usage: 1 month\n\n\n- I use it in the morning in this routine:\nCleanse (Benzoyl peroxide cleanser) > Toner 1 (isntree green tea fresh toner) > Toner 2 (this skin1004 toner) > Moisturise > Sunscreen\n\n\n> Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Betaine, Allantoin, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Water, Glucose, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n- Fungal acne safe: YES ✅\n\n\n💭 **My thoughts:**\n\n\nWhen I first saw the product the ingredients list looked promising, but i couldn't find much on reddit about it. I use skinsort a lot though (it's an app where you can check whether a product is fungal acne safe or not) and I looked up this product there and the reviews were really good so I ended up ordering it!\n\n\nThis did not disappoint! I think you can get a fair idea of how I feel about the products through the charts that I have attached, but it's really good and it suits my skin well. It's hydrating, soothing, quick absorbing and it works. Also, it mildly exfoliates the skin but it's not too much and in my opinion it's safe for everyday use! \n\n\nI have used skin1004's tone brightening ampoule too, and I like it but I like this toner WAY more than that ampoule, and in my opinion it works better than the ampoule. Plus if you look up the ampoule on reddit many people have said it broke them out, and I suspect the ampoule was breaking me out too, but I didn't have any such issue with this toner.\n\n\nOverall, I would rate it 4.5/5, will keep repurchasing it. Also, i can tell this will last a while because I have been using it almost everyday, and I layer it twice, but I've only used up the amount you see in the picture so 👀\n",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO. My skin is drier in the winter and oily in the summer.**\n\nThe hyperlinked ingredients will take you to CosDNA analysis of each product.\n\n***PRODUCTS: ALL DO NOT HAVE FRAGRANCE ❤***\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_fe18517608.html) Water, Methylpropanediol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Betaine, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium PCA, Phytosqualane, Isostearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethylcellulose, Propanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n* **Review:** *I have used this for the past 6 months, and I can say this gel-cream really shines in the summer for daytime use. It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

    "body": "\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/SGwb5px\n\n\nI’ve been using tretinoin cream/adapalene for a year now. Dryness and irritation is a constant issue. Currently, I’m using The Ordinary Azelaic Acid twice a day, and adapalene 0.3&#37; four times a week. It’s not as drying and irritating as tretinoin, but I still need a decent anti-redness moisturizing cream to keep my moisture barrier in good shape. \n\nI’ve experimented with various creams, but the ones that saved my skin are creams with centella asiatica/madecassoside as the main ingredient. I have tried around 7-8 madecassoside creams as well as masks/toners, most of which I like. I’m going to review all of them in this post. I’m not going into details of the ingredients since that could be looked up on cosdna. I’m mainly going to focus on fragrance, hydration, texture, packaging, and whether it works well as an anti-redness/calming cream. \n\n**Etude House Soon Jung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm - HG, will always repurchase**\n\n\\-Fragrance free (ph 5.5)\n\n\\-Texture: light cream, absorbs instantly into skin\n\n\\-This is fairly hydrating, but I would still use an occlusive on top to seal in everything. If you have normal/combo skin and are not using tretinoin/adapalene, you could probably use this alone during the summer. \n\n\\-Packaging: metal squeeze tube \n\n\\-Works really well for redness/irritation\n\nIt is often sold out on Jolse so you could imagine how popular it is. \n\n**Etude House Soon Jung 5.5 Relief Toner (not pictured) - maybe repurchase?**\n\n\\-Fragance free (ph 5.5)\n\n\\-Texture: water-like toner\n\n\\-This is not that hydrating, so I would only use this as a cleansing/ph-adjusting toner\n\n\\-Packaging: large clear bottle, but it’ll only last 1-2 months if used twice a day due to the water-like texture\n\n\\-This is an ok fragrance-free toner, nothing to write home about. It does relieve redness, but not as much as the balm. The ingredients are so-so. I have replaced it with Paula’s Choice Pore Reducing Toner. If the PC toner doesn’t work out, I might go back to this. \n\n**Etude House Soon Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream - will repurchase**\n\n\\-Fragrance free\n\n\\-Texture: light cream, runnier than the Etude House Cica Balm, but is greasier and doesn’t really absorb. I don’t really mind since that’s the purpose of an occlusive. Surprisingly, it works well under makeup, you just have to use it sparingly. \n\n\\-This is not that hydrating, but it’s a good occlusive\n\n\\-This comes in two kinds of plastic tube packaging depending on the size. The full-size packaging is a little bit annoying, but it’s tolerable. The travel size packing is a little bit better. The full size packing is a twist up squeeze tube when you open the cap. The travel size packaging is a squeeze tube with a small tip opening. \n\n\\-This is a good occlusive cream, but I wouldn’t use it alone since it doesn’t treat redness and irritation as well as the balm.\n\n**Missha Near Skin Madecanol Cream - maybe repurchase?**\n\n\\-Fragrance free\n\n\\-Texture: medium heavy cream, does not work well under makeup. I would only recommend this at night. \n\n\\-This is fairly hydrating. It also has a decent amount of panthenol in addition to madecassoside so it is very calming. It also has olive oil in it, which may break some people out. \n\n\\-Packaging: metal squeeze tube\n\n**Apieu Madecassoside Cream - will not repurchase**\n\n\\-Not fragrance free due to essential oils in the ingredient\n\n\\-Texture: runny, light cream, does not really absorb into skin, but works well under makeup\n\n\\-Not that hydrating\n\n\\-Packaging: metal squeeze tube\n\n\\-This is an ok cream if you’re not on tretinoin or adapalene but I wouldn’t recommend it if you are. Dry skin may need another hydrating cream on top. \n\n**Apieu Madecassoside Gel - maybe repurchase?**\n\n\\-Fragrance free\n\n\\-Texture: light gel, does not really absorb into skin. This pills if used on top of layers, so I wouldn’t use it in the AM.\n\n\\-Not hydrating, but very calming since it has a much higher amount of madecassoside than the cream. This also has a decent amount of niacinamide so it’s great for acne-prone skin. \n\n\\-Packaging: plastic squeeze tube\n\n**Tosowoong SOS Repair Cica Clinic Balm - HG, will always repurchase**\n\n\\-Fragrance free\n\n\\-Texture: heavy silicone cream, very matte. Surprisingly, it works well under makeup, kind of like a primer\n\n\\-Not hydrating at all\n\n\\-Packaging: metal squeeze tube\n\n\\-This is the BOSS when it comes to redness. It literally kills redness. I had laser hair removal on my legs a few months ago and I had raised follicles and redness/irritation afterwards. Nothing calms it, including aquaphor and hydrocortisone cream. This gets rid of the redness in one hour. I kid you not. This must be some secret formula because the company refused to reveal the ingredients when I messaged them on Facebook. But, I have a feeling it’s a blend of madecassoside, panthenol, and zinc oxide due to how calming it is. However, since it’s so thick (it feels like a mask afterwards), I only use it to spot treat redness. I’m currently experimenting with mixing it with Cerave moisturizing lotion to “dilute” the texture a little while still retaining the anti-redness effects. \n\n**Tosowoong SOS Repair Cica Sheet Mask (not pictured) - HG, will always repurchase**\n\n\\-Fragrance free\n\n\\-Texture: light, watery mask, lots and lots of essence\n\n\\-Somewhat hydrating (most masks are hydrating)\n\n\\-Packaging: The sheet mask is very thin, so it clings to my face well. \n\n\\-I use this mask quite often. I think in addition to it’s anti-irritation properties, it’s also good for acne prone skin due to the small amount of tea tree extract in it. \n\n**Innisfree Bija Cica Calm (not pictured) - will not repurchase**\n\n\\-Fragrance free\n\n\\-Texture: light cream, absorbs instantly, sits well under makeup\n\n\\-It is a little hydrating\n\n\\-Packaging: Plastic squeeze tube with small tip\n\n\\-I don’t think this does as good of a job for curbing redness and irritation as the Tosowoong or Etude House balm. It’s also more expensive than both.\n\n**La Roche Cicaplast Cream - returned to Target, will not repurchase**\n\n\\-Fragrance free\n\n\\-Texture: thickest cream ever, does not absorb and sits on skin forever (makes my skin feel sticky and oily). \n\n\\-Packaging, Plastic squeeze tube \n\n\\-I can’t attest to how well it works for anti-irritation because I can’t get past the texture. However, it has a huge fan base. I would only use it as a spot treatment though, but I already have the Tosowoong cica balm for that and it feels much better on my skin. \n\nI know…this is a long post. Let me know if you have any questions!",

The LaRoche CicaPlast cream works reasonably well for this purpose -- it's not the one that I use most frequently but mixed with tretinoin and put on as the last layer before going to sleep, the thickness isn't a problem.\n  \nI have not had irritation this round of tretinoin use since I layer before application and mix with lotion and/or cream to apply.  Someone once said that I may be reducing the effectiveness of it with mixing but since otherwise I would have burning and stinging skin, this is well worth it for me.  I imagine that if I am reducing some effectiveness, it is still much more effective than retinols and it just may take longer for wrinkle prevention and reduction.",

For someone with dry skin, this may not be the most effective for moisturizing though. I personally really enjoy it. Other than that I've tried the Soong Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream, which was a little too rich for me and not as soothing, but still a gentle cream.",

It didn't even have an official sign on it, just the name and price handwritten in sharpie, so it must be super new. \n\n[Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer with aloe and green tea extract](http://imgur.com/a/q6TViPm) 75ml - $8.99\n\nIt's definitely one of their more expensive cosmetics but based on the ingredients it looks pretty good for the price. Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

    "body": "Myth-busting because this nonsense is starting to rile me up and I want it to die once and for all.\n\nDr.Vanita Rattan has been indulging in fear-mongering tactics for her own personal reasons. This post is meant to put things in perspective.\n\n# Glycolic Acid, in short\n\nFirst of all, Glycolic acid is one of THE MOST studied tried and tested treatments for acne, post-inflammatory pigmentation and scarring, melasma, evening out skin texture. It is SO SAFE that it is one of the few ingredients that pregnant women can use without fear.\n\nGlycolic Acid is used above 20% concentrations only in Chemical peels. With increased concentrations are increased side effects such as irritation, burning sensation, Erythema (redness of skin), increased desquamation. These side-effects are temporary. Of the 8 or studies that I've listed below, only two showed more serious non-transient side effects such as PIH or Hypo-pigmentaion.\n\nOne study mentioned a percentage of 5.6% of the sample having side effects in the form of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, mild skin irritation, and exacerbation of herpes simplex infection. HOWEVER, this % included **all** the side-effects. Regarding incidence of PIH alone, we do not know.\n\nAnother study tried to corroborate the above mentioned study and out of the sample size of 41, 2 people were affected with PIH and 1 with Hypo-pigmentation. This study started out with concentrations of 10% peels and gradually increased it to 30%.\n\nBut let's talk about topical / otc preparations that have smaller concentrations of Glycolic Acid.\n\nThe two studies I've quoted here were both peels, not daily / frequent applications of topicals with a milder concentration. There is a study that concluded while the benefits of higher concentration glycolic acid peels were more effective and beneficial than regular usage of lower concentration application of Glycolic acid on a maintainence basis, the lower concentration was better tolerated and had lesser side-effects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My conclusion\n\nEven if you want to extrapolate those results of 5.6% and 9% and somehow conclude that there is a risk of PIH, to my eyes, it seems insignificant, if you consider it significant, by all means listen to Vanita Rattan and stop using it. ^(But also please don't come to conclusions that way, that's just plain wrong.)\n\nor the more sensible thing to do, would be to to disregard both Vanita Rattan and me and LISTEN TO YOUR DERMATOLOGIST. I know we've all had some bad experiences or another, but **getting worried and wondering  whether you should disregard the advice of your derm, who has seen you and diagnosed you and who actually has the qualifications to diagnose you, as opposed to Ms.Rattan who is NOT CERTIFIED TO PRACTICE DERMATOLOGY is just uncalled for.**\n\nAlso to add Glycolic Acid isn't inherently dangerous BUT use it with caution. Use sunscreen. Don't start at higher percentages etc. If you use it in a safe manner, it's a good, effective, well researched ingredient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Edit: I just watched one video where Vanita Rattan recommends avoiding Glycolic acid. In the video, she clearly accepts that it's a good ingredient and that it's effective. She seems to have two major gripes against it. 1) It causes \"hot spots\" and 2) Because it's so common and easily available people are \"burning their faces off\" by using it incorrectly.*\n\n*Let's start with number 2. There are guides in the sub on how incorporate actives. There are several discussions on this too. Use those resources and avoid user error.*\n\n*On to reason number 1, Hot spots. I found 0 mention of GA causing hot spots in any of the studies I've linked below or the additional studies I've gone through since watching that video. I did find quite a few mentions of TCA peels causing hot spots for no discernible reason at 35% which is a medium penetration peel. Glycolic acid peels are mostly superficial and can penetrate to a medium only at 70% which is the maximum concentration. If the hot spots worry you, don't do 70% peels.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow, I've provided links if you'd like to do your own research and abstracts in other cases, of 6 more studies. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the research conducted on Glycolic Acid. On the contrary, the list would be never-ending. I've picked and chosen studies I felt were pertinent. The studies all involved Fitzpatrick types III, IV, V, VI which are categories that people of Indian ethnicity would fall under. Now unfortunately none of them tested GA at 6% and 12% concentrations everyday which is what would be 100% relevant to us, but the reason I've added them is to show, even at higher % in lab conditions which we will never replicate, the risk is low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Studies: Abstracts, Side-effects and Conclusions\n\n[**Excerpts From Glycolic acid peel therapy – a current review**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3875240/#b29-ccid-6-281)\n\non the right usage of Glycolic Acid for Peels\n\n*\" Glycolic acid is the alpha-hydroxy acid used most commonly by dermatologists for chemical peeling. It is used in concentrations from 20%–70% in all skin types. It should be used in lower concentrations initially, and then the strength of the peel should be gradually increased in subsequent sessions. There should be a minimum interval of 2 weeks between two treatment sessions. Peel neutralization is extremely important and it depends on erythema seen. However, in dark skin, it may be difficult to appreciate erythema. In such cases, it is better to time the peel between 3–5 minutes and judge the desired end-point depending on the time. The longer the duration, the deeper the depth of the peel. Pre-peel priming and post-peel care are equally important. In order to avoid postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring in dark-skinned patients, it is important to avoid facial scrubs, depilatory creams, waxing, bleaching, microdermabrasion, and laser hair removal for at least 1 week before the procedure. After the peel, the patient should be advised to avoid sun exposure, facial scrubs, loofahs, picking at the peeling skin, taking steam inhalation, and using creams that cause exfoliation. The patient must be instructed to use a broad spectrum sunscreen during the day, and a moisturizer at night. The GA peel is safe for a correctly selected patient when the correct technique is used. It does not produce any systemic toxicity. It can be combined with other treatment modalities for better cosmetic outcomes.\"*\n\nVarious studies in skin of color highlight the value of GA peels.

There was significant resolution of comedones, papules, and pustules. The skin texture improved and follicular pore size reduced. Most of the patients were found to have brighter and lighter looking skin. Consistent and repetitive treatment with GA was needed for the apparent improvement of acne scars and cystic lesions.\n\n***Side Effects:*** **Only a small percentage of patients (5.6 %) developed side effects, in the form of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, mild skin irritation, and exacerbation of herpes simplex infection.**\n\n***Conclusion:*** Hence, GA peels were found to be ideal as an adjunctive treatment for acne.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Study II:**](http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323%3Byear=2003%3Bvolume=69%3Bissue=2%3Bspage=148%3Bepage=150%3Baulast=Grover)\n\n***Abstract:*** Grover and Reddu conducted a study of **41 INDIAN patients with Fitzpatrick Skin Type III–V,** of whom 16 patients had acne, 15 had melasma, 5 had PIH from superficial burns / drugs and 5 had superficial scarring of varied etiologies.  Initially, they used 10% GA for a period of 1–2 minutes, then gradually increased the duration to 5 minutes and concentration to 30% GA. After undergoing peels with GA, the therapeutic response was good in 75% of patients, on the basis of both patient and observer assessments. Patients with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring showed excellent improvement. Significant decrease in the number of comedones and papulopustules was observed in patients with mild to moderate acne. However, a patient with nodulocystic acne lesions did not respond well to therapy. Compared to the 90% response seen by Wang et al, [\\[1\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9107290/) 75%–78% of patients with acne,  showed a good-to-fair response with GA peels. Upto 69% improvement in scarring and hyperpigmentation seen by Wang et al [\\[1\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9107290/) was also corroborated in this study.In patients with post inflammatory hyperpigmentation induced by superficial burns (2cases) or drugs (3cases), the results were not encouraging with appreciable response being seen in only 40% of the patients. Fifteen cases of melasma, both molar (53.3%) and centrofacial (46.6) were included.\\[3\\] On Wood,s lamp examination, melosma was considered to be epidermal (80%), dermal (13.3%) and mixed (6.6%).\\[3\\] There was no correlation between the clinical pattern, age, skin type and ingestion of oral contraceptives or pregnancy. With GA peels, a good to fair response was seen in more than 90% of the patients. The poor responders included patients with dermal type of melasma. Side effects in the form of post­inflammatory hyperpigmentation (2 patients) and GA induced hypopigmentation (1 patient) noted in this group. Five cases of superficial scarring of varied etiologies (post herpetic, post TCA application and rhytides) were treated with peels and good to fair response was seen in 80%of them. Apart from this, overall 80% of the patients had experienced an improvement in their skin texture in terms of a smoother and brighter looking skin.\n\n***Side Effects***:  Glycolic Acid was found to be quite safe in this study but for minor untoward effects observed in 4/41 patients (9%). This was in close agreement with a 5.6% incidence of side effects seen by Wang et al. Mild discomfort and irritation of the skin was seen in 11 patients (26.5%) however, none of them discontinued treatment on this basis. [\\[Detailed breakup of Side effects\\]](http://www.ijdvl.com/viewimage.asp?img=ijdvl_2003_69_2_148_5903_2.jpg). **2 people out of the 41 were affected with PIH and 1 patient with Hypo-pigmentation in the melasma group.**\n\n***Conclusion:*** The authors concluded that **\"** GA peels in our study were found to be quite effective and safe in the management of some cosmetic skin problems as superficial scarring, melasma, acne and to some extent post inflammatory hyperpigmentation with an overall improvement in texture and rejuvenation of skin. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Study III:**](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2002.02034.x)\n\n***Abstract:*** In one study, **Forty Indian melasma patients** were divided into two groups of 20 each. One group received serial GA peels (30% for the first three sittings and 40% for the next three sittings) combined with the modified Kligman's formula ie (a triple combination of 2% hydroquinone, 0.025% tretinoin, and 1% mometasone). The other received only the modified Kligman's formula. A significant decrease in the Melasma Area Severity Index (MASI) score from baseline to 21 weeks was observed in both groups (*P* < .001). However, the group receiving the GA peels showed more rapid and greater improvement, with statistically significant results (*P* < .001).\n\n***Side Effects:*** **The only side effects observed with the GA peels were mild burning, erythema, desquamation and a transient PIH.** ***(All of them are temporary)***\n\n***Conclusion:***  It demonstrates that superficial chemical peels are beneficial in the treatment of melasma, if used judiciously and under supervision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Study IV:**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-4362.2001.01149.x)\n\n***Abstract:*** In a study by Javaheri et al, **Twenty-five nonpregnant INDIAN female patients** with a minimum melasma area and severity index (MASI) of 15 were recruited in the study. Patients were advised to carry out a prepeel program of daily application of topical sunscreens (sun protection factor-15, SPF-15) and 10% glycolic acid lotion at night for 2 weeks. Patients were then treated with 50% glycolic acid facial peel once per month for three consecutive months. At regular intervals and at the end of the follow-up period (3 months) after the last peel, the degree of improvement in pigmentation was assessed by remeasuring MASI. Side-effects, if any, were also recorded.\n\n***Side Effects:*** **No signifiant side-effects reported.**\n\n***Conclusions:*** The prepeel program followed by 50% glycolic acid facial peel once per month for three consecutive months proved to be an effective treatment modality in Indian patients without any significant side-effects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Study V:**](http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2001;volume=67;issue=1;spage=28;epage=29;aulast=Gupta)\n\n***Abstract:***  A study was conducted with a sample of **37 INDIAN Patients.** Thirty-one patients with melasma, 4 with superficial post acne scarring and one each with xeroderma pigmentosum and epidermal naevus were studied to know the efficacy of glycolic acid for chemical peeling in varying concentrations and time intervals such as 35% (4 minutes), 52.5% (3 minutes), 70% (2 minutes) at varying intervals upto 6 months. These patients were in the age group of 17-44 years. There were 31 females and 6 males. . Patients were advised to use retinoic acid cream (0.025%) at bed time for 2 weeks prior to peeling. During the peel programme, patient was advised to wash his/her face with soap and water. The face was then cleaned with spirit. Then two coat­ings of acetone were applied to ensure even appli­cation of the chemical. After that glycolic acid in re­quired concentrations as in \\[table\\] was applied from least sensitive to most sensitive area for the specified time period. The patient was advised to clean his/her face with ice cold water for termination and neutralisation. All the patients were given sunscreen lotions during day time and emol­lients at bed time. The application was repeated at an interval of 3 weeks for 4 sittings and then monthly for a total duration of 6 months.No significant improvement was noted in cases of melasma where peeling was done with 35% glycolic acid for 4 minutes but, 52.5% glycolic acid applied for 3 minutes in cases of melasma (27 pa­tients) showed significant improvement. 70% glycolic acid applied for 2 minutes in post acne scarring showed significant improvement but 70% glycolic acid applied for 2 minutes in epidermal naevus did not show any significant improvement.\n\n***Side Effects:***  \\*\\*Minimum side effects were noted with 52.5% concentration in form of erythema, or burning.  (\\*\\****Side-effects in 70% peel were not mentioned.)***\n\n***Conclusion:*** In this study, maximum benefi­cial effects were noted with 52.5% for 3 minutes in melasma and 70% for 2 min­utes in post acne scarring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Study VI:**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20657143/)\n\n**Abstract:** Forty non-pregnant INDIAN female patients with a minimum melasma area and severity index (MASI) of 10 were recruited in the study. The patients were advised to carry out a prepeel program of daily application of 12% GA cream or 0.1% tretinoin at night for 2 weeks. They were then treated with graded concentrations of 20-35% GA facial peel every 15 days in GA group and 10-20% TCA in the second group.\n\nObjective response to treatment evaluated by reduction in MASI scoring after 12 weeks was by 79% reduction (from 26.6 to 5.6) in GA group and by 73% reduction in TCA group (from 29.1 to 8.2) but this difference was not significant.\n\n**Side Effects:**  There are hardly any major side effects, and regular use of sunscreens prevents chances of postpeel hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Conclusion:** GA peel is associated with fewer side effects than TCA and has the added advantage of facial rejuvenation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Study VII:**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4362567/)  ***This study was conducted with focus on SIDE EFFECTS OF GLYCOLIC ACID***\n\n**Abstract:** A sample of 90 patients of either sex, aged between 17 to 21 years, were included in the study and submitted to superficial chemical peeling for acne vulgaris. The study lasted eight weeks and peeling sessions were carried out in each patient. Tolerance to the procedure and any undesirable effects noted during these sessions were recorded. Results were expressed through the descriptive statistics, as simple frequencies and percentages, while for establishing of statistically significant differences, in use was Friedman’s test of significance. The subjects,with an exception of acne vulgaris, didn’t have other skin lesions and didn’t use the systemic retinoides six months before the beginning of treatment, nor topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid three months before the beginning of treatment. The sample of 90 subjects was divided into three sub-samples (each consisted of 30 subjects). To the first sub-sample it was applied 20% alpha-hydroxy acids, to the second sub-sample it was applied 35% alpha-hydroxy acids and to the third sub-sample it was applied 50% alpha-hydroxy acids. All subjects were treated once every two weeks. Treatment (superficial peel) lasted about 2-5 minutes. The study lasted eight weeks. The contact time of 5 minutes was enhanced sequentially with one minute increment on each subsequent visit. Avoidance of the use of soaps and sun exposure at least for one following day was strongly advised. Patients were prescribed sunscreens during daytime and panthenol cream at night.\n\n**Side Effects:** Almost all the patients tolerated the procedure well. Of totally 90 patients, only six, at the end of therapy experienced hard erythema, only ten, at the end of therapy experienced hard desquamation and only eleven, at the end of therapy experienced hard sensation of pulling of facial skin. Mentioned reactions were easily manageable and did not affect the compliance of the patients. None of the patients developed post-inflammatory hyper or hypopigmentation of the affected or surrounding unaffected skin. More significantly, no serious side-effects like laryngeal oedema, persistent erythema and swelling of the face occurred.\n\n**Conclusion:** Chemical peeling with glycolic acid is a well tolerated and safe treatment modality in acne type I.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Study VIII:**](http://www.jcasonline.com/article.asp?issn=0974-2077;year=2019;volume=12;issue=3;spage=158;epage=163;aulast=Sarkar#:~:text=Glycolic%20acid%20peel%20also%20has,the%20end%20of%2016%20weeks)\n\n***Abstract:*** **Forty-five INDIAN patients (Fitzpatrick skin types, IV–VI)** with mild to moderate acne were divided into three groups of fifteen each. Groups A, B, and C underwent peeling sessions biweekly with 35% glycolic acid, 20% salicylic–10% mandelic acid, and phytic acid peels, respectively, for a total of six sessions. All other anti-acne treatments were stopped. Lesion count was carried out at baseline and at each follow-up visit. Acne scoring and postacne hyperpigmentation index were noted at each visit. Photographic record was maintained. Significant reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion count was noted at 12 weeks in all the three study groups. Reduction in acne score at the end of 12 weeks in the three study groups was 70.55%, 74.14%, and 69.7%, respectively. The percentage of postacne hyperpigmentation at baseline was 21.53%, 17.16%, and 16.8% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively (P = 0.916). At the end of 12 weeks, the percentage of pigmentation was 8.8%, 3.1%, and 7.1% in the three groups, respectively (P = 0.090).\n\nThe objective assessment of the postacne hyperpigmentation index was compared at baseline and at each follow-up visit till 12 weeks. The baseline score in Groups A, B, and C was 10.87, 10.13, and 9.67%, respectively (P = 0.210). All the three groups recorded decline in the score at each follow-up visit. At the end of 12 weeks, the score was 6.2, 2.8, and 5.47 in Groups A, B, and C, respectively (P = 0.034).\n\n***Side Effects:***  **No significant adverse effects were noted and all three peels were found to be safe for the Asian population. None of the patients discontinued because of the side effects. Overall, two patients (13.3%) in the glycolic acid and salicylic acid groups, respectively, reported burning, whereas none in the phytic acid group reported any burning sensation. One patient (6.7%) in the salicylic acid group reported postprocedural erythema that subsided within 2 days after prescribing a moisturizer. All peels were well tolerated.**\n\n***Conclusion:*** All three chemical peels are effective in the treatment of mild to moderate acne in Asian population.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Study IX:](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24397731_The_Effects_of_Topically_Applied_Glycolic_Acid_and_Salicylic_Acid_on_Ultraviolet_Radiation-Induced_Erythema_DNA_Damage_and_Sunburn_Cell_Formation_in_Human_Skin) \n\n**Abstract:** To determine whether topical treatment with glycolic acid, a representative alphaHA, or with salicylic acid, a betaHA, modifies the short-term effects of solar simulated radiation (SSR) in human skin. Fourteen subjects participated in this study. Three of the four test sites on the mid-back of each subject were treated daily Monday-Friday, for a total of 3.5 weeks, with glycolic acid (10%), salicylic acid (2%), or vehicle (control). The fourth site received no treatment. After the last treatment, each site was exposed to SSR, and shave biopsies from all four sites were obtained. The endpoints evaluated in this study were erythema (assessed visually and instrumentally), DNA damage and sunburn cell formation. \n\n**Side effects:**  Treatment with glycolic acid resulted in **increased sensitivity of human skin to SSR, measured as an increase in erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation.** Salicylic acid did not produce significant changes in any of these biomarkers. \n\n**Conclusion:** Short-term topical application of glycolic acid in a cosmetic formulation increased the sensitivity of human skin to SSR, while a comparable treatment with salicylic acid did not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally,\n\nAnecdotal Evidence,   Personally I've been using glycolic acid for atleast 6 years now.

I've also done higher concentrations of glycolic acid peels at the derm's and while there were side-effects like erythema and burning, these were temporary and disappeared because I heeded my qualified medical practitioner's advice, wore sunscreen, applied moisturiser and avoided going into the sun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I've decided, I'll keep updating this post as and when I need to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"I* ***do not*** *consent to this post or any part of it being reposted on any social media (including but not limited to YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat).

I'm disliking her more and more, considering she just came out with a pigmentation \"treatment\" product. 😐 \"Specialist for SOC\" treats darker pigmented lips as a health condition, rather than completely healthy, common and natural. 😐 If that isn't capitalizing on cultural insecurities, I don't know what is. You'd think she'd respect that people trust her because of shared ethnicity, but apparently that's just a market advantage for her to dupe them. I don't like it one bit 😤",

Maybe I can understand if she was referring to regular use of highly concentrated peels and acids (30% and above) but 5% glycolic acid solution used 3-4x a week won't burn and peel your skin if you apply sunscreen regularly and patch test before use. And if you're sensitive to GA (because skincare is so subjective I wouldn't be surprised if my zodiac sign has a role to play here) they can always use Gluconolactone or Mandelic Acid instead. \n\nI don't understand the fearmongering. She can advertise her hyperpigmentation procedures without hating on glycolic acid.

You have to remember that Dr V aims to treat hyper-pigmentation in a gentle manner with little to no risk to burns or reactions. She \n\nMany dermatologist actual recommend staying away from glycolic acid because of the risk it can pose, due to its small molecular size, not because it burns every b/b person's skin. The problem is you cannot predict who's skin will react, regardless of skin prep, as our skin can be very reactive.\n\nAny skin can be reactive regardless of ethnicity, however, the melanin producing melanocytes in b/b skin are larger and more hypersensitive than caucasian skin, thus, more prone to hyper-pigmentation. Something as simple as laser hair removal has a high chance of causing hyper-pigmentation in b/b skin.  So rather than risking the potential for reaction, with glycolic acid its recommended that large molecule acids should be used instead when treating b/b skin. With medication we are given a list of potential side effects its up to you to decide, whether to risk the potential consequences for results, to take said medication or get an alternative with less risks.  \n\nHydrocodone can produce amazing results in brown/black skin but can ,consequently, cause PIH with pigmentation coming back worse than before. A lot of dermatologist still prescribe to patients, but do to the risks, some would say to avoid it altogether. Check out the channel of black licensed dermatologist Dr Alexis Stephens who too is weary of potential problematic actives. She does't rule out glycolic acid altogether, however, because of the potential risk she prefers other less problematic actives and recommends it at a maximum of 5%. Based on the risk she does not recommend hydrocodone at all, but, there are a lot of videos from dermatologist referring to it as the gold standard in treating hyper-pigmentation and the best treatment for this for suffering individuals.   \n\nThe bottom line is the genetic difference associated with black and brown skin is so vast and varying, that predicting reaction cases to case is nearly impossible. And remember or lack of visibility or feeling of reaction on the skin does not mean irritation is not taking place deep below the surface of the skin.  \n\nDue to our reactive melanocytes some profession take a preventative approach and avoid reaction causing actives in favor of gentler result producing ones. At the end of the day, when informed, its a personal choice to decide to use a treatment and risk reaction or go for less problematic one. Skin is a living organism and there is no one size fits all approach that can be taken. When it comes to glycolic acid use your previous experiences of skin reaction, evidence and information from professionals to choose if you're willing to take the risk. Good short term result now do not equal lack of consequence in the long run. The result can be amazing or disastrous but, ultimately, **the decision lies with you because it you that will have to deal with the resulting outcome.**",

    "body": "**Liquid Gold Review, or: How I learned overexfoliation is a bad thing**\n\n**TL;DR:** If your moisture barrier is damaged, this stuff will seriously change your life. Support an up-and-coming indie shop and repair your moisture barrier, all without breaking your wallet.\n\n**Background:** I recently upped my skincare game considerably through the infinite wisdom and patience of r/SkincareAddiction and r/AsianBeauty. I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country. I couldn’t be happier to love this product and have the opportunity to support her shop.\n\n[Stratia Skin, Liquid Gold, $24](https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/skincare/products/liquid-gold)\n\n*Disclosure: I was asked to write a review of this product that was originally intended only for Alli to read for formulation feedback and my experience with the product. I only decided to write it for public consumption when I realized she was opening the shop and other people could get this product. I did not accept the product with an agreement to review it positively, nor have I received any monetary compensation for doing so.

This is my cautionary tale.  I am eczema prone (on body) so I have a naturally weak moisture barrier. Last summer with all the snail, ceramides and HA my AB game was so good,  I started using a pro retinol serum nightly and some AHA and BHA. I could not believe how well I tolerated it. I was not new to actives.   I was shedding a lot of stuff out of my pores, but no irritation.  Nice and plump.  Suddenly my face got sunken and older.  It was my moisture barrier.

I just wanted to add some  impressions and my skin type.\n\nI have dry, sensitive, always-red skin with hormonal acne. I tested Liquid Gold on half my face for two weeks and it didn't cause any visible changes. No increase in acne, no miraculous redness reduction. I find it very minimally moisturizing. My skin still feels dry and tight after letting it sink in (which I agree happens quickly) and I have to follow it with a heavier moisturizer (or three.) There is just a tiny amount of stickiness and little to no slip after it dries/absorbs.\n\nI, too, have been trying to find a way to use actives without over-exfoliating. Daily use of a mild BHA and AHA has proven too harsh in the past, so I've been increasing in frequency very  slowly and now I'm up to every other day with no discomfort or peeling, even when combining BHA and AHA and using my stronger products.\n\nI'm really happy with Liquid Gold and see myself using it indefinitely. The price and ingredients speak for themselves, and the packaging is really nice too. One last thing I just thought of: I was showing it to my mom and she had an irritated spot on her hand from a cut or something, so I put this on that spot and she said it was amazingly soothing.",

I think I read a while ago that the max that can be used in cosmetics is 2% in Japan, but don't quote me on that. I may have found that info on Ratzillacosme's blog, but I can no longer find it. Taiwan's max is 3% I believe, but don't quote me on that either. :P",

I'd looked at Hada Labo's Shirojyun Premium Lotion, but was concerned that I couldn't find any good estimates of the % in it. (I've also used the Skinlex Alpha Arbutin Serum you listed, but I also assumed the tranexamic acid in it was too low to have much more than an incidental effect so it wasn't the reason I bought the serum. Like I was happy it was in there instead of some other random ingredient, but wasn't expecting much from it.)",

This is the ONLY brightening serum I’ve tried that lightened my acne spots in a matter of 2-3 months rather than 1.5-2 years. I just finished my 3rd bottle last night, lol. Tryyying to go on a no buy for all of May, but if I start breaking out into new zits, I will 100% buy this to take care of the hyperpigmentation.\n\nI went through 1.5 bottles of the Inkey List Tranex Serum and saw zero results. My acne marks showed absolutely no change over the few months that I was using this. Then I went back to the Good Molecules, boom 2 weeks and the spots were basically gone. Also the texture of the Good Molecules is slightly thinner, and doesn’t make my moisturizer pill the way the Inkey List does.\n\nEdit: Another product with TXA is the Murad Replenishing Multi-Acid Peel. It’s a biphase acid toner with tranexamic, salicylic, glycolic, lactic, and malic acids. I don’t believe they disclose the % of any of the acids.\n\nEdit #2: I just saw your reasoning for not including the Murad on the list!",

However the Inkey List one sometimes causes my moisturizer to pill, which is annoying. I only use it at night, so it's less of an issue I guess!\n\nI was wavering between this one and the Good Molecules tranex serum. I'm betting (hoping) the Good Molecules formula has at least 2-3% tranexamic acid and probably 5% niacinamide. I'm also interested in the JJLabs formulas. A youtuber I follow knows the founder/chemist behind the brand and swears by some of his products, so I do think they are legit. I figure it's kind of like going to a compounding pharmacy to get a specific drug combination custom formulated for you, but instead it's skincare. I agree it's unusual.\n\nMy questions about tranexamic acid that I can't seem to find much on are the side effects - I was really worried if this would cause irritation because I'm sensitive to most acids (bha, aha, even ascorbic acid), so I didn't know if this would be something like hyaluronic acid or more like an exfoliating acid.

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "Edits: Tried to fix some formatting issues. \n\n—\n\nHi everyone! \n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/?st=JIATDG0T&sh=d905c745), I talked at length about the skin condition of rosacea -- what it is, the subtypes, what the causes are, the foundations in treatment (cleansing and moisturizing), as well as treatments and beneficial ingredients. This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Rosacea is such a tricky beast, this is a great post to help us newbies get started. \n\nI think I might pull the trigger on the DE TLC Framboos, I’ve been sensitive to other glycolics, but it seems like this one has a lot of other soothing ingredients and it’s so well reviewed.",

I saw your science of rosacea post  and it pinged an area I've been struggling with. I always have very dry lips, despite drinking plenty of water and using a combo of Laniege lip mask and aquaphor lip ointment. I LOVE lipstick and it makes me really sad that my lips are constantly peeling despite my best efforts. (1) Is this a rosacea thing? (2) Any luck with HG products to help it?   \n\n\nI also have a rage spot on one eyelid. It is the first to flake if I go overboard on new stuff. Annoying but a helpful tool.",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

HG moisturizer besides Cetaphil DAM (cheaper alternative) . boon for sensitive and dehydrated skin. skin saver during my whole tretinoin journey. extremely hydrating and soothing. works similar to boroline on dry patches around nose and mouth . and non-pore clogging! admittedly a little heavy and non-absorbing which is why I might not use it in summers.\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all from my side !!also I did not use all of these products at the same time. I'm writing everything from memory since some products were used +3 years ago . even those still in use, I alternate between them on days since I don't need to apply them everyday and all. so most of my products last for a very long time since I combined them and alternate between them. of course, patch test first and thankfully, none of them reacted in a bad way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsuggestions from the subreddit \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfollowing products were subreddit recs and I haven't used them at all , so ya'll can search more about them an maybe give them a try!\n\n* irem hyaluronic acid serum (HA)\n* pyungkang yul mist toner\n* inkey list polyglutamic acid\n* herbivore cloud jelly serum\n* the ordinary NMF moisturizer\n\nthere are a lot more but I'm too lazy to read all of them . do mention your HG in the comments!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthere are many other humectants that I haven't mentioned , like niacinamide which is present in trace amounts in almost all products. personally, never tried any products with honey extract in it (I figured snail mucin does a better job , but who knows) . for newer products, ill update them one I'm done trying them for at least 2 months (or let me know if you guys want it any earlier , I got no issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway I hope this list helps out ! I didn't have any knowledge about humectants while my skin was being tortured by over-exfoliation and I was looking like a baboon's ass so take care of your skin so it doesn't look like this 🥵 also this took a long time , so leaving an upvote will feel nice 🥰",

(I'm Brazilian btw)*\n\n**Skin type:** Combo, sensitive, acne and hyperpigmentation prone.\n\nWhen I bought these products, I was looking to soothe my redness and even out my tone...but I can already say that I was quite disappointed. Let's go to the reviews.\n\n**Glow Deep Sérum:** It has a watery texture and no smell. It has rice and alpha arbutin as it principle active. I used it for about two months and I can say that, I've barely seen any difference. It just gives a nice glow but that's all you know? I didn't notice a difference in my skin tone or my acne breakouts. Completely ineffective.\n\n**Calming Serum:** It has a light gel texture and a mild herbal scent. It has green tea and panthenol as it principle active. I've used for two months too and had the same reaction...barely any remarkable difference. No redness soothing or calming pimples. Nothing.\n\n*— Final considerations:* Despite being affordable, they are not good at anything. Which was extremely disappointing for me, as I like other Beauty of Joseon products! They sit nice on the skin, has a nice sensory but none results. I don't know if others have had the same experience but it was what I've felt.\n\n(This is my first review tehehe)",

    "body": "^*(last updated 4.5.14: they changed the trader joe's formula, it's off my list!)*\n\nConditioner only washing: washing your hair with conditioner only and cutting shampoo out of your regular routine. This is, as far as I can tell, the gentlest way to cleanse your hair. People with dry, damaged, or brittle hair may find this particularly beneficial, as well as people with very dry, sensitive or oily scalps (over production of oil can be a result of overdrying or irritation). Seems to be able to be adapted for any hair type. \n\nUPDATE: [A pic of my day 2 hair; about 2 months since my last shampoo](http://i.imgur.com/sSSrdLQ).\n\n[From this article on shampoo:](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)  “Many persons feel that they do not have good hygiene unless they bathe daily. Technically, it is not necessary to shampoo the hair daily unless sebum production is high. Shampooing is actually more damaging to the hair shaft than beneficial.\" \n\n*****\n##How \n*****\nI CO-wash every 2-3 days, sometimes 4-5 if I'm using dry shampoo, deep condition my ends once every 1-2 weeks and before shampooing, and shampoo around every 4-6 weeks or when I get some kind of serious crud in my hair.  My scalp is also naturally oily, which means I'm always going to have to cleanse more often than people with dry scalps. When I first started doing it I CO-washed every day and shampooed weekly-biweekly, but the longer I do it, the longer I can go in between. A good dry shampoo can do wonders, too.  \n\n**Method**  \n\n 1. Thoroughly wet your hair, which can take a minute if your hair is low porosity or very thick.  \n\n 2. Get yourself a generous handful of conditioner and saturate your roots with it. Use the pads of your fingers (no nails) to massage the conditioner all over your scalp. Make sure you thoroughly massage every inch. This is easier with your head hanging upside down. Get some more conditioner if you need to, there's no such thing as too much.  \n\n 3. Rinsing after this step then working a second round of conditioner all through your hair is sometimes recommend. I've experimented and find it (personally) unnecessary. I just work some more conditioner into the length of my hair and finger comb it through. When I deep condition this is when I use it.  \n\n 4. Let your hair soak for the rest of your shower. I'll often take a bath and read for a while with the conditioner in my hair. Letting it sit for at least 5 minutes is an important part of the cleansing process; your oil needs time to dissolve into the conditioner.  \n\n 5. Thoroughly rinse your hair, massaging the scalp again as you do. Easier with your head upside down, but I'm not coordinated enough to keep the water from going up my nose so I just tilt my head way back and lift it in sections to help work my fingers through.  \n\n**Tips**  \n\n - Before you start this method, it's a good idea to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any build up. There are many ingredients in many haircare products that are difficult to remove and require stronger chemicals.  \n\n - Wash your face or anywhere you're concerned about acne/sensitive skin after you're done rinsing.  \n\n - If you're worried about an adjustment period, start out alternating CO-washing and shampooing with a gentle poo, and slowly increase the proportion of CO-washes.  \n\n - Comb through your hair with a wide toothed comb while the conditioner is in. It's easier to detangle and your hair is more elastic during this phase, which means less breakage, and it'll preserve your natural texture.  \n\n - Scratching/irritating/overheating your scalp causes it to produce more oil.  \n\n - I squeeze out all the excess moisture and let my hair air dry. A lot of others recommend drying with an old tshirt or microfiber towel. Terry cloth tends to rough up your hair and promote frizz and tangling.  \n\n*****\n##Why  \n*****\nThere are multiple ways this method can work to clean your hair. The first is by dissolution, the principle that oil dissolves oil. This is how the oil cleansing method works, which has been very popular in Asia for thousands of years, and historically they've placed a much higher value on hygiene than in the West. This is much gentler than surfactant based cleansing. The oils, humectants, and fatty alcohols in a good CO-wash bond to the oils on your scalp and roots (the soak), distribute them throughout your hair, and rinse away clean with gentle agitation (the scalp massage.)\n\nThe other way CO-washing can cleanse your hair is actually the same as shampoo: many conditioners still contain surfactants. I prefer to go mostly surfactant free, but some of them have certain benefits (just discovered [cetrimonium chloride](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-what-is-cetrimonium-chloride), [it's pretty spiffy](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ls6zx/advice_on_a_heat_protectant_without_silicones_and/cc4h5r0), though I'm being cautious because there are some [allergen concerns](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701258/CETRIMONIUM_CHLORIDE/)). Some surfactants have conditioning properties, lift the cuticle and allow it to absorb moisture, and some will lightly coat your hair, lending slip and shine.  \n\nWith this method it's VERY IMPORTANT to **avoid anything that builds up on your hair!** This means checking what's in the products you're putting on your hair and doing your research. **UPDATE:** Check out /u/smbtuckma's [guide on silicones](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) for more info on determining what will and won't work for your totally customizable routine! **Waxes** can build up and make your hair look dirty, particularly if it's fine; they can lend definition to curls though and are not drying. **Fatty alcohols** are emulsifiers (bind oil and water) and help provide slip to a conditioner, something you want, but can cause build up, particularly with waxy sebum, so they shouldn't be too high on the ingredient list; I haven't experienced an issue with them.\n\nQuick list of...\n\nDrying alcohols: Denatured alcohol, SD alcohol 40, Witch hazel, Isopropanol, Ethanol, SD alcohol, Propanol, Propyl alcohol, Isopropyl alcohol  \n\nFatty alcohols: Behenyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, Isocetyl alcohol, Isostearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol, Myristyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, C30-50 Alcohols, Lanolin alcohol\n\n**Ingredients I look for:**  \n\n - **coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair to moisturize, protects protein bonds, but usually very comedogenic; for more info on all the oils I mention check out [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m014r/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_1_oils/) )*\n\n - **jojoba oil** \n\n - **sunflower oil** \n\n - **glycerin** (humectant)\n\n - **honey** (humectant, can lighten your hair/enhance highlights, be careful if you're worried about preserving your color; in it's raw form has strong antibacterial properties)\n\n - **aloe** (humectant; acidic, which helps remove mineral build up and seal the cuticle; contains protein(amino acids), if your hair starts to show signs of [protein overload](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html)(crunchy, brittle, less elastic) cut back; extremely under studied with highly contradictory information out there, so experiment for yourself and draw your own conclusions)\n\n - **cetrimonium chloride** (cationic surfactant, increases tensile strength when combined with heat)\n\n - **panthenol** (significantly improves shine and manageability)\n\n*****\n##Who  \n*****\nAs far as I can tell, this method can work for pretty much anyone as long as you're willing to experiment to find the right conditioner. My scalp is oily, my hair is extremely fine, low porosity, bleached, dyed, henna-ed, dry, and extremely fragile. This method cleanses my scalp and roots thoroughly and nourishes my length, leaving everything soft, shiny, stronger than it ever has been in my life, and really enhances my natural texture. My scalp also seems to be producing a LOT less oil than with any other method I've tried. I've seen glowing write ups on this method with every hair texture, thickness, and density; from what I can tell it started with the curly community.\n\nThe biggest obstacle seems to be **knowing your hair type** and what works for it:  \n\n - Fine or thin hair is going to need a very light product that rinses very clean.  \n\n - Chemically colored hair will eventually be stripped by oils that penetrate your hair (coconut oil, olive oil, sunflower seed oil) so should avoid those in regularly used products\n\n - Low porosity hair doesn't like too much protein (makes it crunchy, brittle, less elastic; this is specifically in reference to hydrolyzed protein, other types won't absorb) and seems to need an extra boost from humectants to absorb moisture, especially since (if you opt for a surfactant free route) you're no longer lifting the cuticle to help it. Still needs some protein/strengthening treatments,  you have to find a balance for your hair [More on this over at Curly Nikki](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html).  \n\n - High porosity hair typically loves hydrolyzed protein (you need that word to be in front of the protein ingredient for it to be absorbant) and much more readily absorbs, and loses, whatever you put on it. Needs more attention from products that coat/seal in moisture and smooth the cuticle. \n\n - Wetter/oilier sebum is the easiest to remove and really lends itself to this method.  \n\n - Thicker/waxier sebum might do better with a conditioner that contains more emulsifiers, such as surfactants. Jojoba oil is also a good ingredient to look for, because of it's chemical structure it can really effectively penetrate and combine with what's on your scalp. I've read that build up from fatty alcohols is particularly an issue with waxy sebum.  \n\n*I would love to hear some feedback on waxier sebum and high porosity hair!*\n\n**I do NOT recommend this method to anyone experiencing issues with dandruff.** Dandruff is often a fungal infection called melassazia in your scalp's yeasts. I recommend visiting a doctor or certified trichologist to find out your cause; I've read about successfully treating it naturally with raw honey, coconut oil, aloe, hemp oil, and tea tree oil, but this really all depends on what kind of dandruff you're dealing with, and a lot of the evidence is anecdotal or under studied.  \n\n*****\n##What  \n*****\nCO-Washing:  \n\n - **Mane n' Tail Conditioner** *(wow, gotta say, this stuff might be my new favorite! Contains cationic surfactants (good, conditioning ones), coconut oil, glycerin, and hydrolyzed protein. I've been alternating it with the Trader Joe's conditioner lately, and myt hair has been perceptibly healthier. I think I finally found my protein balance!)*\n\n - **Sukin Organics Nourishing Conditioner** *(100% carbon neutral and cruelty free. Contains cetrimonium chloride, aloe, and hydrolyzed protein. Good slip.)*\n\n - **As I Am Coconut CoWash** *(Lightweight, leaves my hair very bouncy and shiny with LOTS of texture. Great slip, very moisturizing, rinses clean.)*\n\n - **Tresemme Naturals** *(haven't used it but often recommended, contains drying alcohols low on the list, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Giovanni Brazilian Keratin & Argan Oil Ultra Sleek Conditioner** *(haven't tried, recommended)*\n\n - **Suave Naturals** *(haven't used, often recommended, range of options, some have NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **As I Am Cleansing Pudding** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*   \n\n - **Curl Junkie Daily Fix Cleansing Conditioner** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains yucca, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Darcy's Botanicals Daily Cleansing Conditioner Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains wax, label says NO SURFACTANTS but it has BTMS, a very mild cationic, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Curly Q's Curlie Cutie Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\nDeep Conditioning:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner** *(contains shea butter, aloe, panthenol, and coconut oil, some of my favorite ingredients; NO SURFACTANTS, also contains emulsifying wax so should be used sparingly)*, **Cold pressed coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair, protects protein bonds, but a little bit goes a very long way! Also very comedogenic for most people, be careful of it near your face. Excellent as a pre-poo treatment. Not ideal for chemically colored hair, because of it's penetrative abilities it can remove the color molecules.)*  \n\nShampooing:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo** *(uses the gentlest surfactant on the market, decyl glucoside, NO PENETRATING OILS, [break down here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1l4sjc/product_recommendation_community_survey_shampoos/cc0o2kz))*  \n\nClarifying Shampoo:  \n**Malibu Swimmers Water Action Shampoo** *(no sulfates but still effective combo of surfactants and ingredients that remove mineral build up, panthenol, smells like orange push pops...)*\n\nDry Shampoo:  \nThe best one I ever tried from the store was **Dove.** I prefer to just make my own with arrowroot powder and cocoa powder. Corn starch is popularly recommended and the ingredient in most of these dry shampoos that soaks up the oil, but I find that the arrowroot is finer and disappears better.",

        "body": "So, /u/SnooSnooCookie asked me about a specific conditioner, [Matrix Total Results Color Care Conditioner](http://www.google.com.au/imgres?um=1&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=G7g&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=878&tbm=isch&tbnid=1Qc4icCLLeYB4M:&imgrefurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/shopping/DYH0200911KK0158.htm&docid=vQoU3xg8hp02dM&imgurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/upload/2011/matrix-total-results-color-care-soin-couleur-conditioner-10-1.jpg&w=221&h=550&ei=7rktUrOVBIbPkQWjmoCwCA&zoom=1&ved=1t:3588,r:1,s:0,i:80&iact=rc&page=1&tbnh=194&tbnw=80&start=0&ndsp=30&tx=10&ty=102), for COwashing. Here's a break down of it with some helpful resources for you guys.\n\nGenerally, I'll just google the ingredients in a product one by one; eventually you start to remember what's good and what's bad.  I'd say MAYBE it'd be a suitable COwash, but I think you can do a lot better, especially for the price. Here's the ingredients list:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetyl Esters, Isopropyl Myristate, Isopropyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone, Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Linalool, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Dodecene, Poloxamer 407, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone \n\n -  Cetearyl Alcohol is a fatty alcohol, meaning it's moisturizing. Fatty alcohols cause build up issues for some people, particularly those with waxy sebum. I prefer to see them farther down the ingredient list, things are listed in the order of largest quantity to smallest, but this isn't a deal breaker; lots of frequently recommended COwash are very heavy on fatty alcohols. \n\n -  Behentrimonium Chloride is an emulsifier (binds oil and water), antistatic agent, and mild cationic surfactant. Basically, this means it will both condition and clean your hair. Popular ingredient in co-wash conditioners (I, personally, am super sensitive to surfactants so avoid them, but most people don't have this issue.)\n\n -  Glycerin is a humectant (attracts water) and one of my favorite hair care ingredients. Be careful of it in leave ins if you're in a low humidity climate, without other products or humidity to provide moisture it'll actually attract water out of the interior of your hair. In a co-wash, this helps both clean and moisturize your hair.\n\n -  Cetyl Esters are a wax used to thicken products, waxes can build up on your hair and make it look dirty after awhile. This may not be an issue if you're hair isn't easily weighed down (mine is) and in combination with the behentrimonium chloride. Only way to know is trial and error.\n\n -  Isopropyl Myristate is used as an emollient and helps make a product slippery (a good thing for COwashing), however I'm finding conflicting information on it and nothing solid about it's application to hair. Generally, it's an accepted moisturizer, however there's solid information on it's potential for irritation and clogging pores. There's also some discussion that it can be drying. I dunno. This is a confusing one. I'd just try to avoid it.\n\n -  Isopropyl Alcohol is a drying alcohol. It's difficult to avoid drying alcohols entirely, but good to do if you can. You definitely don't want it this high in an ingredient list. [This page has a handy list of drying alcohols, fatty alcohols, and silicones](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Parfum/Fragrance is the bane of my existence. I'm usually super sensitive to it. It can mean almost anything, companies aren't required to report their personal fragrance blends, so they're frequently drying/irritating. They're also in freaking everything. Damn near impossible to avoid, so just aim for low on the ingredient list.\n\n -  Phenoxyethanol is a preservative, it keeps your product from getting moldy.\n\n -  Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone is a silicone; generally, silicones are the top thing you want to avoid with COwashing. This one, however, is a [water soluble silicone](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/08/water-soluble-silicones-101.html), so it MAY be ok to use with this method. There's really conflicting information about the role that cones play in hair care, some studies say they only simulate the appearance of health and block the absorption of moisture, others say they help protect hair from heat damage and can help act as humectants. The only way to know what works for you is trial and error. I would think that, combined with surfactants, water soluble silicones MIGHT be ok for SOME people. I don't mess around with them because my hair is so easily weighed down. Again, [this page has a handy list of which silicones are and aren't water soluble](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil is a moderately penetrative oil, which means usually it's a GREAT ingredient for hair care and COwashing. However, penetrative oils can strip hair dye; proceed with caution.\n\n -  Tocopherol is vitamin E, it acts as a moisturizer and preservative.\n\n -  Linalool is a fragrance and byproduct of essential oils and vitamin E, generally not a concern unless you have eczema and it oxidizes.\n\n -  Chlorhexidine Digluconate is probably being used as a preservative here, it has antiseptic/antimicrobial properties. Some moderate risk for irritation.\n\n -  Citric Acid is an acidifier and preservative. Also removes hard water build up. Moderate acidity is great for hair care, it helps close the cuticle = make your hair shinier.\n\n -  Benzyl Salicylate related to salicylic acid, generally used as a fragrance ingredient. Some concerns about potential for irritation/developing a sensitivity to it over time.\n\n -  Limonene is used primarily as a fragrance in toiletry products; used commercially as a solvent, ie it strips oils. Some concerns about irritation and developing sensitivities to it.\n\n -  Butylphenyl Methylpropional is a fragrance with irritation and endocrine disruption concerns. It's use is heavily restricted.\n\n -  Dodecene is a known skin irritant, appears to be used as a thickener. Primarily used in the manufacturing of detergents.\n\n -  Poloxamer 407 is a gentle non-ionic surfactant. It's also hydrophilic, which means it attracts water molecules. Good ingredient for COwashing.\n\n -  Hexyl Cinnamal is a fragrance with some irritation and allergen concerns. Safe in small amounts (this qualifies).\n\n -  Citronellol is a fragrance with sensitizing concerns.\n\n -  Benzyl Alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with solvent properties, used as a preservative. Not a concern in small quantities.\n\n -  Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone is a fragrance with some allergen concerns in large quantities.",

I've been using Herbal Essences Smooth Collection conditioner mostly because I love the smell and I was thrilled that they brought it back (90s teen in me was quite happy). I may try other conditioners too, but this one is pretty good for now and it is sulfate free.",

        "body": "Hi ladies!! First of all, thanks SO much for putting this how-to together! I have a question, and I feel pretty silly asking it. I've had a pretty oily scalp my whole life, and I am used to waking up and starting my day with a shower/washing my hair. I have never been the type that could wash my hair at night and then just get up and go in the morning. But now, I see that as being one of the many perks/benefits of this COwashing method! But here is my question - how in the world do you sleep on your hair so that it is still wearable the next day?? Not referring to the oily hair, which would be diminished by this new hair-washing technique, but the crazy, tangly roughed-up looking hair that I wake up with? Any tips or advice on this? Like I said, I feel silly asking about this, but I cant remember a time where I didnt wake up and shower first thing in the morning before going to school/work, so I've never had to worry or think about \"bed head\". Thank you!! :)",

        "body": "Hello! Thanks for all the info I’m so excited to try! A few questions to make sure I understand correctly: \n\nI’m worried about the adjustment period, so I want to alternate co wash and shampooing like you said. So I should start with a clarifying shampoo, and then use a gentle poo? At what point should I use the clarifying shampoo again? \n\nAlso you mentioned the Trader Joe’s conditioner but they make several, which one do you recommend? Thanks! \n\nCurrently I only clean my hair every other day. Should I be I washing everyday or is every other day cowashing/shampooing ok? \n\nI excersize often and my hair gets very sweaty. Does this change anything? \n\nThanks!",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

        "body": "Can we stop hyping up retinal until there's solid evidence that the products containing it actually work?\n\nI've posted multiple times about how CoValence (retinal supplier) seems sketchy, but people kept downvoting me. Now that companies are dropping their retinal, it’s clear there’s something going on. Are we really supposed to believe that a small indie brand from Hungary can stabilize retinal better than major cosmetic giants? Feels suspicious, to say the least. Geek & Gorgeous can't even formulate a sunscreen yet and it's much easier than stabilizing retinal.\n\nEDIT: It seems like they are using a cellulose-based encapsulation complex called Microsponge® N 720TRA. If you want to know how reliable it is, google the company that makes it - AMCOL Health & Beauty Solutions (HBS) because there’s barely any information about this company, except that it has only 28 employees. Tell BASF they don’t need over 100k employees if some unknown indie company with 28 employees \"managed\" to stabilize retinal when BASF can't. Geek & Gorgeous are 🤡.\n\nEDIT 2: Even [the spec sheet for this retinal mentions ](https://pub-mediabox-storage.rxweb-prd.com/exhibitor/document/exh-0bdf9e23-93d9-4c11-b922-f7b6f3dfb551/2fb66a9d-defc-4c10-8da6-9bad2982aa55.pdf)\"The slow release of retinaldehyde occurs through a combination of friction and diffusion.\" This makes me wonder if all of the retinal could be prematurely released during transportation, especially due to movement or heat exposure.",

It’s cellulose based and the INCIs used for the stability system match with the ones found in A-Game 20. \n\nI’ve found a set of slides online (from April 2022) from a company called Mineral Technologies (there quite known compared to CoValence) that shows data about stabilization and efficiency of retinal with the MICROSPONGE N system and they’re also claiming to have done a clinical study on the effects and irritation potential. \nSlides and data can be found here: https://www.ulprospector.com/knowledge/media/2022/03/HBS-Retinal-Webinar-for-UL-Prospector-v2.pdf\n\nI’ve asked G&G if they’re using this delivery/stabilization technology in their A-Game 20 serum and will update this comment if I have an answer.",

To be honest It looks good on paper But retinaldehyde is really hard to stabilize and when it comes to effectiveness and using a stable retinaldehyde i don't trust their formulas. After using two 0.1 bottle it did nothing for me and honestly it was one of the worst retinals i've ever tried and i'm not the only one to be disappointed there's many people here and threads having the same experience so i'm not sure if this formla is going to be different.",

        "body": "The Microsponge N delivery technology used in this product is not that new or groundbreaking, Naturium uses it in their \"cult favourite\" retinal serums for quite a while and it works for a lot of people. I do not think that the stability of retinaldehyde is some unsolvable mystery some people would have you believe. It is not 2010s anymore, many cosmetic chemists talk about innovation in retinaldehyde delivery and stabilisation. The fact that smaller companies hold the patents and handle manufacturing of the actives... that is kinda how the industry works. Basing arguments on what L'Oreal does or does not is... a little strange. There is much more that goes into their decision-making than \"if retinal is difficult to formulate with\" and what guides their approach to development is motivated by very different motives (optimising growth for shareholders) than what drives smaller brands (oftentimes wanting to be acquired, but generally innovating more boldly to get established in the market sector and thus survive). \n\nWhat I do agree with is that, unlike prescription drugs, cosmetic retinoids can be less consistent from batch to batch in terms of efficacy. This can to some extent be limited by buying directly from the brand (cutting the time of products being on the shelf etc) and storing products in optimal conditions. As for comparative studies of retinaldehyde and other OTC/RX retinoids - there are few, but those that we have been promising as this systematic review from last month shows: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39348007/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39348007/)",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured.

So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it.

For example Cosrx AHA / BHA toner is fine, TO Glycolic acid toner is not, ISntree 8% AHA toner is not, MInimalist AHA, BHA, PHA Peel is not.\n\nYou also need not give a Detailed review, but a mini-review with usage guidelines and results observed is required. If you have previously posted / or seen someone else post a detailed review that you agree with,  post a link in your comment to the review post / comment. If you are linking a post not your own, please the credit OP.   Please also mention if the product is sensitive skin / acne-prone skin friendly. \n\nIf the product you wanted to comment has already been mentioned please upvote and add your experience as a reply NOT as a separate comment. This will be helpful in creating the sample routines.\n\nThis is a BEST OF thread, so do not add rejects as a separate comment, However if you have had a bad experience with a raved product, add your experience as a reply, so that everyone gets a balanced view.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilar Megathreads for [Dry Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vmmrbw/megathread_best_products_for_dry_skin/), [Combination Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vmmuml/megathread_best_products_for_combination_skin/), [Balanced aka Normal Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vmmyqr/megathread_best_products_for_balanced_aka_normal/) will be up.

    "body": " \n\nThis is my first time doing a comparison post, so please bear with me. I really hope this post is well organised and everyone finds it an informational and entertaining read. I have been wanting to do this comparison since the minimalist released its peel, and I finally got the chance to that. I have uploaded a video and images for the comparison but I'll first start with the review.\n\nReview\n\n* *Your skin type-* Sahara desert dry skin\n* *Your current climatic conditions-* Hot af\n* *Your current AM/PM routine-*  \n**AM**\\- Nothing, I only apply sunscreen if have to go out  \n**PM**\\- Ponds cold cream (for my double cleanse), cleanser (Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser), tret (twice a week), ordinary peeling solution (once a month), innisfree jeju volcanic mask (once a month), moisturizer (I have like 4-5 moisturizers that I use)\n* *Your age- 22*\n\n**The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* More than a year\n* *Ingredient List-* Glycolic Acid, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Daucus Carota Sativa Extract, Propanediol, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Potassium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Polysorbate 20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n* *Holy Grail but Will Not Repurchase-* I fucking love it, it made my skin so smooth and my complexion brighter. I never had any skin problems before as such, but it just made everything better. I never experienced any sort of purging or irritation with this peel. Although, I will not be repurchasing it because I paid ₹1200 for this even though it lasted more than a year. The availability is an issue too.\n\n**Minimalist AHA BHA PHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* 2 times\n* *Ingredient List-* Aloe Vera Juice, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Gluconolactone, Mandelic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lecithin\n* *Holy Grail but Will Repurchase-* I loved it in the very first go, I saw immediate results much like the ordinary. I did not experience any sort of irritation or purging with this either. I honestly don't have much to say because the results are pretty much identical for both.\n\nComparison\n\n**Texture**\n\nAs you can see in the video below, apart from the colour difference the minimalist one a bit flowier than the ordinary. Also, I like the shape of the dropper of the minimalist one, it's pointy rather than the round tip and it looks classier ( at least to my eyes). That is really it when it comes to the texture and the feel of the products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/mobbuo/video/dxwg1bxpdes61/player\n\n**Application**\n\n*note- i forgot to take my before pics, pls forgive a newbie 😔😔😔*\n\nI did a half-n-half application of the peels. The immediate thing I noticed was the way they applied, ordinary being thicker is slightly easier to spread because it doesn't drip as much as the minimalist.\n\nAlso, idk what it is about minimalist peel but I had to apply it a tad bit more than its counterpart.\n\nThird, minimalist did not burn AT ALL while the ordinary always burns a little, even after a year of consistent use.\n\nIn the images below you can see my skin right after the application of the peels, the results are very much the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kdr544sdes61.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8425c82498afb958897ee5482979129fdc1c07d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion-** I like both, I don't have a preference for one over the other when it comes to the results. The only thing is that minimalist is cheaper and easily available, so I will go for that one instead of the ordinary.",

This includes **madecassoside** since it's an ingredient derived from centella, and **panthenol**, since it seems to be paired up in a lot of centella/madecassoside products.\n\nI've recently been obsessed with these ingredients but I'm incredibly overwhelmed by the options available nowadays as it seems like every brand has their own line! As someone with pretty bad facial eczema, it seems like exactly what I need. I know Dr. Jart's Cicapair line, Etude House's Soon Jung line, The Face Shop's Dr. Belmeur line, and A'pieu's Madecassoside Cream are some of the more popular ones.\n\nI'd love to hear everyone's experiences with the known HGs as well as the newer or less mentioned ones!

I have mild hormonal acne but almost never break out from skincare products.  \n\n\n**Product Name 1: A'pieu Madecassoside Cream**\n\n\n**Thoughts:** My neck tends to get flaky, red, and itchy.  It is the first place to break out in hives if I contact something irritating.  My old stand-by was Aveeno Skin Relief Intense Moisture Repair Cream (I like the colloidal oatmeal in moisturizers).  I decided to replace it with the A'Pieu to compare.  For the past 2 months, I've been layering SCINIC honey AIO ampoule with the A'Pieu cream; 2X daily.  I haven't had any flakes, itchiness, or hives since then.  It is not very moisturizing, though.  Mostly just a lighter-weight hydrating cream.  The main downside is that because it is so silicone-heavy, it doesn't layer well under a very silicone-y sunscreen (like Shiseido senka aging care SPF 50).  The A'Pieu doesn't feel siliconey to me, even though it contains a lot of them.  I enjoy using it, but it's not HG status for me.\n\n**Product Name 2: La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 (non-AB)**\n\n\n**Thoughts:** I really enjoy this as a top layer when I break out in hives.  It helps to limit the amount of topical steroids I have to use.  Once I get the hives or eczema under control with an OTC hydrocortisone cream (usually just 1 or 2 applications), then I can stop the hydrocortisone use, and just layer the LRP as an outer layer for several days.  It's not moisturizing or hydrating for me (in fact, the zinc is a bit drying), but I use it as a soothing layer.  I don't think I could use it alone as a moisturizer.  I haven't found a cream / balm that's as calming as this, so I will definitely repurchase when I finish the tube.",

        "body": "Skin type: dry,  texture, redness\nProduct name: Gowon Tigre Skin Toner\nThoughts:  This is a very very thin toner that comes in a spray bottle. I was attracted to this toner since it consists of 80% Centella Asiatica Extract.  I need about 3 pumps to match one layer of my usual Pyunkang Yul essence toner. Unlike the Pyunkang Yul, I don't feel any residue after it sinks into my skin.   I prefer that feeling, however- it at least psycologically confirms to me that I put some product on my face.  I don't feel like it's as moisturizing as my usual toner,  but the centella extract may be more calming or healing.  Since its so light,  I use it when I don't want too much product on my face.  Otherwise,  I use it as a base for more heavy moisturizing toners.  I'm giving it a chance to work out until I run out, but I don't know if it's the best product for dry skin.",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chi00fdvc8731.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a191ba338f59eaa0c66ece19e1e3b5311c87dfa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. \\[SCINIC\\] First Treatment Essence - 4.16/5 (5,282 Reviews)**\n\n150ml/19,800 KRW\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Adenosine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Water, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b08iueb0d8731.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=163f45d2760c17dfc195db29d3e667246a7c272c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. \\[TORRIDEN\\] Dive-in Serum - 4.42/5 (1,127 Reviews)**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xantham Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract.\n\n*This looks like Hada Labo lotions tbh. :o Except with more skin soothing things like panthenol, witch hazel, madecassoside, allantoin and such.

    "body": "Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%.

And guess what it works on giant cystic acne that TO's bha being completely useless at treating. From what I know it's not available outside of Apac region, which is a travesty because good skincare should be had by all. \n\nBut I'm in Malaysia and Hada Labo is practically everywhere.

Considering that a tube of PanOxyl costs around that much din naman, just book an appointment.\n\nI had recurring acne breakouts that lasted for 2mos, and they cleared up just a\nmonth after trying the products that my derma prescribed. After naman we worked on the acne spots. She also pointed out what I was doing wrong. Turned out I was using a very harsh cleanser that damaged my skin barrier. If di ako nagderma siguro lumalala pa acne ko and mas marami pang products na nasayang. \n\nLike you I was worrying din before na baka mas magastos. But the derma I found was very nice and prescribed products that are available in drugstores, some even on the orange app. Very direct to the point din approach nya, one skincare problem at a time. She's also not pushy. Just make sure that you get a board-certified derma. r/beautyph has a thread for recommended dermas.\n\nHope this helps.",

    "body": "My goal for this post is to be as honest, transparent, and genuine about my acne journey as I can be.\n\nBut first, I’d like to provide a little bit of context to suit the requirements of these kinds of posts. \n\n**Skin Type and Skin concerns**\n\nI have oily skin and my main skin concerns have always been acne, congestion around my t zone, redness, and scarring from my acne. Over the course of my journey, I feel like my concerns have improved in all aspects as you can see in the photos! \n\n**Usage of Prescription Medication** \n\nI would like to preface that I have NEVER used accutane or any other oral medicines to clear my skin. The only prescription medications I have tried are tretinoin, adapalene, and epiduo although as you read on you’ll see these really didn’t work very well for me haha. \n\nThe other required information can be found within the remaining post. \n\n**My Journey** \n\nWhere to begin... Well, my acne started when I was 15 and got really bad when I was 17 during 2020. At this time, I knew nothing about skincare so I tried literally all of the suggested products for acne such as tretinoin, adapalene, epiduo, OTC retinols, BHAs, AHAs, benzoyl peroxide, and the list goes on and on.\n\nDuring this time, I found that these ingredients sensitised my skin so much and honestly made my skin even worse than when I first started using them. I would tell myself that this was just the \"purging\" process so I persisted but even a year into it, my skin was left sensitive, damaged, and I had all of these small pimples all over my face. It was almost as if the purging process never ended haha (Let me know if any of you guys have experienced this). Even when I tried to introduce these products gradually into my routine, they would cause the same effect.\n\nI was stuck in the vicious cycle that so many of you I am sure have felt before which looks something like this:\n\n1. You see a new product on social media\n2. You spend your money to buy said product\n3. You get your hopes up that this is going to be the one to save my skin\n4. You try it\n5. Maybe you are in denial for a bit that its working\n6. You realise that its not working\n7. The cycle repeats as you find the next product to purchase\n\nNot to mention that emotionally, this was one of the lowest points of my life. The feeling of not wanting to be in photos, lacking confidence in your appearance, not wanting to go outside to meet your friends, not wanting people to stand too close to you. I've had these thoughts before and I'm sure you have too.\n\nFollowing this period, I pivoted and tried Korean skincare, focusing on products which could calm and soothe my acne prone skin. I have to admit that I was one of those victims of those 10-step glass skincare routines... Whilst I thought this was helping, in reality, using so many products was actually irritating my skin. Despite this, I would say that my skin did improve a bit during this time as you can see in the photos but it was still very red and inflamed although the amount of acne did decrease a bit compared to when I was using the more harsh actives.\n\nAs I am sure you guys are wondering, what finally worked for my skin was protecting my SKIN BARRIER. This meant focusing on nourishing and hydrating my skin to repair my heavily damaged skin barrier from all those years of abusing it. Switching to this approach genuinely transformed my skin and finally this year, I have noticed that my acne is starting to go away and my overall complexion looks much brighter!\n\nThe skincare routine I used to achieve this and still use is as follows:\n\n**Morning**\n\n\\- Ilso Sensitive Bubble Relaxing Cleanser\n\n\\- WELLAGE Real Hyaluronic 100 Toner\n\n\\- WELLAGE Real Hyaluronic Blue 100 Ampoule\n\n\\- Ilso Cencera Repair Cream\n\n\\- Cetaphil Pro Acne Prone Oil Free Facial Moisturising Lotion SPF 25 (I don't love this product but I use it still because its the only sunscreen that I have used thus far that doesn't break me out. Would love to hear which sunscreens you guys use too!)\n\n**Night**\n\n\\- Dewytree Hi Amino All Cleansing Milk\n\n\\- Ilso Sensitive Bubble Relaxing Cleanser\n\n\\- WELLAGE Real Hyaluronic 100 Toner\n\n\\- WELLAGE Real Hyaluronic Blue 100 Ampoule\n\n\\- Ilso Cencera Repair Cream\n\n**Tips with this Routine** \n\n1. After cleansing, I actually apply the toner and ampoule multiple times. When your skin barrier is damaged, it is harder for it to \"suck up\" moisture so start by first only applying one layer of toner and one layer of the ampoule and then build up to layering the toner and ampoule multiple times and increase depending on how much your skin can absorb! Now that my barrier is healthy, I layer my toner 3 - 5 times and my ampoule 3 times.\n2. For most people, I would actually recommend you to start with just washing your face with water in the morning and follow it with a hydrating cream and sunscreen. At night, cleanse your skin with a cleansing milk as these are significantly more gentle than water based cleansers and then just apply your cream. This is pretty much the same routine as the one above but without the toner, ampoule and foam cleanser. You can even apply a couple of layers of the cream depending on how much hydration you need! Once your barrier improves slightly, then introducing things like the toner / ampoule or the foam cleanser can improve your skin even more.\n\n**Quick Review of my Three Favourite Products** \n\n1. **Ilso Cencera Repair Cream:** This cream has been my favourite moisturiser ever since I started using it. I love that it contains centella asiatica as well as skin barrier enhancing ingredients such as ceramides, fatty acids, cholesterol and panthenol. Additionally, it doesn’t break me out! \n2. **Ilso Sensitive Bubble Relaxing Cleanser:** This cleanser is a foaming cleanser which traditionally some may find drying. However, in my experience, this cleanser is incredibly gentle but still has strong cleansing power and I have been using it non-stop for a long time now. \n3. **WELLAGE Real Hyaluronic 100 Toner:** This toner has a very simple formula which contains various forms of hyaluronic acid. It’s texture allows for it to be easily layerable which I find has helped like no other when it comes to hydrating the inner layers of my skin. \n\n**Daily Behaviors That I Think Have Helped My Skin** \n\nAs much as I would love to tell you that protecting your skin barrier will give you the flawless skin you've always dreamed about, this is not true. There are so many other biological /environmental factors which influence acne such as stress, lifestyle, hormones etc so leading a healthy and balanced lifestyle alongside effective skincare will get you the best results! I’ve listed a couple that I believe have helped me! \n\n1. **Reducing Stress:** Stress is extremely multifaceted and can be caused by so many different things. I have found that my skin is quite heavily tied to my emotional wellbeing so by ensuring that I allocate sections of my day to “effective rest” (This means activities that ACTUALLY relax you. For e.g for me, scrolling on my phone non-effective rest because whilst it is fun, at the end of it, I don’t feel rejuvenated at all), I feel like my skin has benefited greatly. \n2. **Reducing Time in Shower:** I used to be someone that loved to take hot showers for a long time but I feel like once I started cutting down my showers to 5 - 10 minutes and reducing the temperature of the water, my skin was less irritated and red. \n3. **Prioritising Sleep:** Sleep is the time in which your body regenerates itself so of course, a consistent sleep schedule has really helped my skin. \n4. **Be Gentle:** This means reducing any kind of physical damage to your skin in the form of scrubbing too hard with your hands when cleansing or wiping your face too vigorously when drying it etc. \n\nThere's so much more I want to talk about but I might save it for another post in the future as this one is already getting super long hahaha. With that being said, if you've read up to this point, thank you for taking the time to read my story and I hope that it has helped you in some way. If you every have any questions, or you do decide to try this kind of skincare philosophy, I would love to hear about whether it worked for you so feel free to message me directly or comment below.\n\nOf course, remember to never give up!\n\n**Timeline for the photos used:**\n\n\\- The first set of photos were taken in 2020\n\n\\- The second set of photos were taken in 2023\n\n\\- The final set of photos were taken in 2025\n\n",

    "body": "Hello! So 2020 was the year I finally really got into skincare, and especially AB skincare. My skin type is oily-combination and I mostly struggle with dehydration and CCs. I live in a tropical country, so it’s summer and hot/humid all year long, so most of the products I used were lightweight and focused on hydration and soothing. This review will be (almost) all of the skincare I tried this year, hopefully it is informative enough and can be beneficial!\n\n\n\n**PURITO** ***Defence Barrier pH Cleanser***: Gel cleanser with a pH of 5.5, contains tea tree (you can kind of smell it), centella and royal jelly. It’s a viscous, slightly runny thick clear gel that lathers but does not foam. I don’t know why though this broke me out :( My skin did not feel tight at all, but I think it does not cleanse enough so instead left a stubborn trail off CCs along my cheek, and after months I am still trying to heal from it. Heard really good things about it but maybe not for me :( **2/5 WNRP**\n\n**Hada Labo** ***Tamagohada AHA+BHA Mild Exfoliating Face Wash***: Tried this in an attempt to help my CCs since I can’t find other SA face washes where I live. Thick, white paste that lathers and does not foam that much. Honestly don’t think it exfoliates at all since it’s wash off, and the packaging indicates there is only 0.98% AHA (glycolic acid), and the BHA (salicylic acid) is even lower in the ingredients list. It’s a bit stripping, and although it did not break me out, it did not do anything either. **2/5 WNRP**\n\n**Senka** ***Perfect Whip Facial Cleansing Foam***: This was the cleanser I used before going into skincare. I heard it has high pH, and even though my face never felt tight it does always make that squeaky sound after cleansing if you rub your hands on your face? Haha. This foams a lot and the foam does keep up for a long time. Definitely does not recommend for sensitive skin, as it could be overly stripping, but since it does not break me out, I will have to keep using it until I find a better cleanser. **2.5/5 WRP**\n\n**COSRX** ***One Step Original Clear Pad***: This was first exfoliating pad. It contains willowbark water (a form of BHA), tea tree and betaine salicylate. The pads are textured with slightly raised dots so it physically exfoliates as well. It contains 70 sheets so sometimes I stick a few around my face and leave them like a sheet mask. It definitely helped a bit with managing breakouts and a bit on skin texture, though there is no huge difference as it is very mild chemical exfoliation. Definitely thankful I started chemical exfoliation with this as it is very gentle, but now I think I’d use a slightly stronger one. **4/5 WNRP**\n\n**Wishtrend** ***Mandelic Acid 5% Skin Prep Water***: This was my first sole AHA. It’s a runny and watery, has a slight like medicine smell. It contains centella, hottuynia cordata, licorice root extract, beta glucan, panthenol, and sodium hyaluronate in addition to the AHA, which I honestly feel more benefits from than the exfoliation itself haha. It is very hydrating, but from an exfoliation standpoint I think it is quite too mild (probably because the mandelic acid molecules are larger relative to other AHAs) so it did not seem to do much. **3.5/5 WNRP**\n\n**Benton** ***Snail Bee High Content Essence***: A thick, clear essence that looks more like a serum but it applies like water. This contains snail mucin, bee venom, willowbark extract, and a couple other plant extracts, and it has no scent. I had really high hopes since I saw many reviews saying the product tremendously helped their breakouts but aside from hydrating a bit it did not really do anything on my face. **3/5 WNRP**\n\n**COSRX** ***Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence***: The super hyped super popular essence with 96% snail mucin. This is the most hydrating product I’ve ever used, has a clear, slimy (sorry;-;) texture but once you apply it, the slimy feeling goes away. I think I have to go against the crowd here, honestly this product leaves like a oily(?) film for a long time and does not sink in well. Initially cleared some CCs on my forehead and had really positive results, though after three months of constant use, it broke me out on my cheeks, which is a huge pity. I will mourn for this forever. **3/5 WNRP**\n\n**PURITO** ***Centella Green Level Buffet Serum***: Accidentally bought the scented instead of the unscented but it was okay. This has a gel consistency similar to the Benton essence, contains 49% centella extract, peptides, niacinamide, green tea extract, panthenol and ceramides. It does not do anything to breakouts but is very hydrating and is incredible in relieving redness and soothing irritations. **4/5 MRP**\n\n**Dr Ceuracle** ***Royal Vita 33 Propolis Ampoule***: Okay for a broke student like me, this definitely broke the bank considering the tiny 15ml bottle that barely lasted over two months even when I use just a drop or two every day. It’s definitely a very concentrated, viscous ampoule, and it has a slight sweet scent, like honey. I think I put my expectations too high here reading the reviews haha- it’s definitely not a cure-all and did not help with acne/CCs. Though given the small amount I used, it was incredibly hydrating and I could see the “propolis glow” mentioned constantly, I was so scared my face would fall into a dehydrated, dull mess after I stopped using it. But honestly after months of not using it anymore, I don’t think it’s worth repurchasing if you’re short on budget like me🥲 **4/5 MRP**\n\n**Somethinc** ***AHA BHA PHA Peeling Solution***: Okay so this is a local brand from Indonesia, but they ship worldwide so I am including it here. So this is very similar to the TO AHA BHA solution, both also has the daucus carota sativa extract to make them red, but this one has a far lower percentage and therefore is more gentle. It contains 3% AHA, 1% BHA and 2% PHA, and is far more runny than the one from TO. Although it is advised to be used once a week and washed off, since it’s mild, I am able to use it 1x/3 days without washing it off. This + the dokdo lotion were game changers this year, cleared up a huge lot of my stubborn CCs without compromising my skin barrier at all. **5/5 WRP**\n\n**Round Lab** ***1025 Dokdo Lotion***: THIS. This is the dream moisturizer I do not deserve. It’s a very lightweight lotion similar to the Hada Labo Gokujyun Milk but with the sea water and more beneficial plant extracts (including centella, licorice root and chamomile) and squalane, that literally becomes water when you spread it. It sinks in quickly and is not sticky at all, is incredibly hydrating AND moisturizing (a bit more than the Soon Jung emulsion) that I don’t need to add any thicker moisturizer, and for some reason it somehow helped with skin texture issues. **10/5 oops, HG WRP**\n\n**Illiyoon** ***Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream***: A very thick cream that does not feel too heavy and sinks in relatively quickly. I bought the 200ml size and it lasts a very long time, even when I used it for both my body and face. Since my face is oily-combination, it is quite too heavy for me, so I apply this while my face is still damp with a toner. Its definitely soothing and moisturizing enough for dry skin, and I’ve heard people use this on babies, so I can easily recommend this for all skin types. **4.5/5 MRP**\n\n**KOSE** ***Suncut UV Protect Spray***: I love using spray sunscreen as it is super simple and trouble-free.   This one claims to have SPF 50+ PA++++. It does leave a slight shiny film on top of your face but is not really a huge bother as it did not break me out and will sink down after. It is transparent and does not leave any white cast, and is especially nice for touching up throughout the day, even if you are wearing make up. A con would be that its quite expensive for a 60gr bottle, and also there is a risk of not applying enough/evenly as it is sprayed. **4.5/5 MRP**\n\n**Innisfree** ***Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask 2x***: This 100ml tub honestly lasts a very long time. It’s a clay mask but it also contains AHA to help with skin texture. It has a thick but spreadable consistency and somehow feels cooling to the face when applied. I use this once every few days in a thin layer and most of the time there really were visible differences in minimizing the appearance of pores. **4/5 MRP**\n\n**Lululun** ***Facial Sheet Mask - White***: I got the pack of 7, which was a deal honestly. The sheets are thick but the face sizes are the smallest I’ve ever used. The amount of essence is moderate. It’s moisturizing so I sometimes skip my moisturizer and just use this for the night. But aside from that I did not see any brightening properties from this white version. **3/5 MRP**\n\n**Mediheal** ***Meience Sheet Masks***: The first and only mediheal masks I’ve ever gotten as the other types are quite more expensive :(, but I am hooked. The essences in these masks are very abundant, I ended up using the rest for my arms. The sheets are of different components for each of the four different masks. The morning after I used this my pores were far less visible, the texture on my face lessened a lot, and a growing pimple I had calmed down. I don’t know what sort of magic mediheal has, but I will definitely look into their other ones after this. **5/5 WRP**\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading, have a great day!",

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

The only duds I've found are the ones from Biotique, Patanjali and Himalaya shampoos as they don't have a silky smooth lather and they feel harsh. I am using the L'Oréal Total Repair 5 and I have no complaints. \n\nThe most important thing in my opinion is the conditioner.

So, I don't care if Biotique is sulphate or sulphate free. I just know its gentle, and even if I use more, it never harms me.

Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad.

    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

And my skin is not dry but dehydrated, which are different things.\n\nI tried to explain to her that I know that gel is for very dry skin, but that I have very sensitive skin and all the other moisturizers I've tried were either massively greasy or thick or rather irritating and stinging. The Neutrogena hydro boost gel on the other hand kinda disappears after 30 seconds from application and doesnt leave me greasy nor does it specifically seem to cause breakouts. I don't feel like it makes my skin \"great\" but it's the \"less bad\" moisturizer that I've tried so far.\n\nThe product she was suggesting (a Biotherm serum) didn't convince me because there was fragrance in it and I'm trying to avoid all inflamation triggers. Ultimately I asked her if she had a sample to try it out first as I'm trying to be more cautious with skincare spending as at some point it got out of control lol, but she had none so I didn't take the risk and left with yet another Neutrogena jar and that's it. I've been trying to find a replacement for my exact skin type for a while now but it never worked and I keep coming back to it.\n\n So I'm here to ask, what's the BEST moisturizer for:\n\n- very sensitive,\n- couperose-, redness- and hyperpigmentation-prone,\n- acne-prone,\n- combination skin?\n\nMoisturizers that irritate my skin:\n\n- Neutrogena oil free moisturizer (supposed to be for skin like mine but it burns my eyes and irritates me a lot);\n- Cetaphil cream for acneprone skin.\n\nCerave PM is very good but TOO greasy so I only use it at night.\n\nIngredients that irritate my skin: Pretty much everything at doses higher than 5% (e.g., Niacinamide 10%, Vitamin C 10%, etc.), also, likely fragrance.\n\nIngredients that my skin loves:\n\n- low dose niacinamide;\n- zinc;\n- panthenol;\n- low dose azelaic acid;\n- glycolic acid (no more than once a week).",

        "body": "Hi, fellow sensitive acneprone combination skin with hyperpigmentation here 49F, need fragrance free, mild actives, low %. \n\nI am very happy with Dr. Sam’s Flawless Neutralizing Gel (FNG). % are: azelaic 5, Salicylic 2, bakuchiol 0.5, squalane 5. \nIts a moisturizing gel, aimed to calm down redness, prevent acne, anti-inflammatory, brightens discoloration and hyperpigmentation. Has antioxidants. \n\nMy skin loves this gel!! I have great results with daily use. Recently I joined the FNG challenge, to use it 14 days in a row and afterwards my skin was brighter, no mild redness anymore, more radiant, very smooth, clean pores. I need to use it longer to see how it really affects hyperpigmentation, it seems less dark now. And no breakouts during my cycle, when I was I’ll or when I was too tired to clean my first. All these always give me acne and thus prevented it. \n\nExpensive but you need little product and it covers exfoliating, brightening, soothing, hyperpigmentation treatment, moisturizing and mild anti-aging. Last year Dr Sam had a sitewide 25% off for Black Friday. \n\nThey may already have pictures of the FNG challenge on Dr. Sam’s www. or IG.\nHope this helps.",

If it’s not making you break out, giving you a rash or creating any other kind of irritation then keep using it. At some point the hyperfixation on “good” ingredients or brands is just a real world manifestation of capitalist consumerism.

    "body": "Rating system:\n\n1/5: absolutely terrible\n\n2.5/5: average\n\n5/5: exceptional\n\n\n\n*This is one of my favorite brands. Their products are pretty affordable fragrance-free, and very gentle on the skin.*\n\nRadiance Cleansing Balm:\n\n5/5\n\nThe best cleansing balm I have ever tried. I have found it to be quite soothing to the skin. It removes my makeup with ease and doesn’t leave a residue. Sooo good!\n\nGinseng Cleansing Oil: \n\n4.5/5\n\nThis one is so nice. It removes makeup very well. My only caveat with this one is the smell. It has a natural smell from the ingredients which is quite medicinal. Not a negative to most people but I found that it lasts a bit after washing off. \n\nGreen Plum Refreshing Cleanser:\n\n4/5\n\nNice cleansing gel. Very gentle. This is a good choice if you are someone who double cleanses. It foams up a bit but it isn’t overly stripping.\n\nGinseng Essence Water:\n\n3.5/5\n\nI know that someone is going to bite my head off for this but this toner is a bit overrated imo. Nothing bad about it but there are hydrating toners which do the job better. It is nice but underwhelming.\n\nGreen Plum Refreshing Toner: AHA + BHA:\n\n4/5\n\nThis is an excellent choice for someone who wants a chemical exfoliant but has sensitive skin. Very hydrating, but gentle enough that you could almost use it every day. Very nice product\n\nGlow serum: Propolis + Niacinamide:\n\n4/5\n\nNice serum. I suspect it would work well for acne prone skin with the propolis and niacinamide. Just be cautious of the propolis if you have allergies to flowers or pollen because that allergy might be set off by the propolis.\n\nCalming Serum: Green Tea + Panthenol:\n\n4.5/5\n\nNice soothing serum. It’s hydrating and absorbs immediately.\n\nRevive Serum: Ginseng + Snail Mucin:\n\n4/5\n\nNice but imo there are better snail mucin products out there. \n\nRevive Eye Serum: Ginseng + Retinal: \n\n5/5\n\nThis product is a game changer for people looking for affordable retinal products. I would use this all over the face like your usual retinoid (not just on the eye area). The texture is so nice and light, unlike most retinaldehydes I’ve tried. It layers beautifully. While the percentage of retinal is on the lower side (0.02%), it is at an effective percentage to see results. It’s also encapsulated to minimize irritation. This is an excellent introductory retinal product! I have enjoyed this product so much!\n\nDynasty Cream:\n\n5/5\n\nSo nice if you have normal or combo skin! Perfect occulusive texture without being too rich. Very soothing ingredients! Really wonderful product. This one has been my nightly moisturizer during the summer months and my skin loves it!\n\nRed bean water gel:\n\n5/5\n\nThis product is the light hydrating moisturizer my oily skin has been searching for my whole life! Literally phenomenal! Highly recommend for oily skin or people looking for a lightweight summer/morning moisturizer. There is also some data to indicate that the red bean in this product could reduce sebum production and boost the efficacy of your sunscreen (though there needs to be more studies to validate this).\n\nGinseng Moist Sun Serum (SPF 50+ PA++++):\n\n3.5/5\n\nMelts into the skin quickly. High SPF and very lightweight but it looks greasy on the skin (be mindful of that if you have oily skin). My main gripe with this is that it contains fragrance, which wasn’t necessary and could be sensitizing. \n\nMatte Sun Stick (SPF 50+ PA++++):\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love this one! It’s very compact and I love that I can just shove it in my purse and reapply it throughout the day. The ingredients are very soothing and even though I am someone who at times can be prone to irritation with chemical filters, this one caused no issues even around my sensitive eye area. It is also the most mattefying sunscreen I have ever found. It literally works like a blotting powder, which is something I adore as a person with oily skin. The only negative is that you do not get a lot of product for the price, which makes it more expensive than the other two SPF’s from this brand. Still, this is an absolute favorite of mine.\n\nRelief sun: Rice + Probiotics (SPF 50+ PA++++):\n\n5/5\n\nI mean this product took the internet by storm for a reason, it is incredible! This has been my daily sunscreen for like a year now and I have gone through several tubes (I must be on my fifth or sixth tube by now). Not sensitizing at all, hydrating, melts into the skin pretty quickly, no white cast, affordable, and it layers well under makeup.",

EDIT: It's also available for 20,000 KRW on Coupang for those who live in Korea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients from [cosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d77e425390.html)\n\n>water, propanediol, cetyl ethylhexanoate, squalane, hydrogenated poly(C6-14 olefin), gylcerin, panthenol, cetearyl alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Glyceryl stearate citrate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 stearate, Hydroxyethyl acrylate / sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, butylene glycol, acrylates / c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, gylceryl caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Sorbitan isostearate, Asiatic acid, Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini Oil, Tocopherol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't used the Water Sleeping Mask before, but I've read mixed reviews on it and I'm curious how the two products will compare. The price is also right at that point where I'm not sure if I want to give it a shot. How about you guys? Anyone here going to go for this?",

The cream is an opaque white whereas the other sleeping masks are more gel like and translucent. It’s definitely not heavy or suffocating thick cream and it’s surprisingly spreadable and not as dense or oily as expected? I haven’t tried it so I’m useless lol but I hope that was some decent product description. I can’t remember if there’s a scent so probably nothing toooo strong. I have oilier skin so I really don’t use creams until the fall/winter. But I’m excited bc I love cica stuff and yeah Liah did hype it up a bit lol",

Ltd. **코스메카 코리아** ([website](http://www.cosmecca.com/eng/))\" is the 3rd largest cosmetics manufacturer in Korea.\n\nThe company was founded by current chairman & CEO **Cho Im-Rae** in 1999. He was born in 1953, studied Chemical Engineering at Sung Kyun Kwan University, and started his career at a leading Korean cosmetics company Peeres as a skin care researcher (The company Peeres later became Skinfood). He was the first research director of Kolmar Korea in 1992 and moved to Taewoong Cosmetics as a manufacturing director in 1993.\n\nTaewoong Cosmetics faced a possibility of bankruptcy as many other companies struggled during the Asian financial crisis. Cho Im-rae could find another job with his quite impressive experience at cosmetics manufacturing but he could not move as he ran a big team at the Taewoong Cosmetics' factory and they all could lose their jobs if he moved. Finally he decided to buy out Taewoong Cosmetics and changed its name to COSMECCA in 1999.\n\n.\n\n>**# Research-Oriented Business Strategy**\n\nDuring Cho Im-Rae's time at many other cosmetics companies, he has realized that cosmetics business is all about research and development.\n\n*\"Cosmetics can look good with fabulous design, can sell well with massive marketing efforts, or it can be very cheap on price-wise. However, customers will loo away from all the products that actually do not work well. Our mission is to create the best quality products and it could be done with huge investment in research & development. This R&D First philosophy is now our culture.\"*\n\nWith this philosophy Cosmecca has put their best efforts and resources on R&D to develop new innovative products. They succeeded developing BB creams that have 3 different function (UV protection + wrinkle improvement + Brightening) for the first time in the world in 2002 as well - Brands like SKIN79 and Hanskin, known for the best BB cream brands for a time, used to launch many different BB creams like [Hanskin Super Light Touch BB Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Hanskin-Super-Light-Touch-Cream/dp/B0057OBTNG) or [Skin79 Green BB Cream](https://www.amazon.com/SKIN79-Super-Beblesh-Triple-Function/dp/B00E7IF4NY) through Cosmecca.\n\n[Cosmecca Korea R&D Team \\(Source: Cosmecca Korea Website\\)](https://preview.redd.it/07jldexkh6c11.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c82517ab22268b97532d53aaa807957028bdbc7)\n\nThe efforts on research & development has helped improve manufacturing system as well.\n\nThey adopted Toyota's famous manufacturing process 'Just-In-Time' for their cosmetics manufacturing process and reduced its conveyor belt from 12 meters to 3 meters so that they can improve manufacturing efficiency.\n\nThis helped improve its productivity over 400% and helped them manage product defects easier and faster.\n\n.\n\n>**# Consistent Growth in Difficult Condition & Situation**\n\nAs a later mover, Cosmecca prepared for a quantum jump through IPO and it seemed plausible that they would go public soon in early 2010's.\n\nHowever, in 2013, a big fire broke out at its one of Cosmecca's main manufacturing facilities Eumseong Factory and it caused a lower valuation on Cosmecca.\n\nAlso in 2015, Cosmecca's China factory got a factory relocation order from Chinese government, which also caused its efforts for IPO defeated.\n\nAmong these unfavorable circumstances, Cosmecca retained its core reputation on cosmetics manufacturing ability and finally became a listed company on KOSDAQ in 2016.\n\nThey also recorded continuous sales growth every year and now they are the top 3 cosmetics manufacturer in Korea following Cosmax and Kolmar Korea.\n\n[IPO on Kosdaq in 2016 \\(Source: MK News\\)](https://preview.redd.it/oa44lsjrh6c11.jpg?width=499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2dae97b02a748790e64e3f39d822d8a53c946dc2)\n\nCosmecca also recently bought a 34.71% stake in a New Jersey based skin care manufacturer Englewood Lab for $53.7 million (article: [Cosmecca Korea buys majority stake in Englewood Lab](http://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800028&year=2017&no=821860)). Englewood Lab worked with over 80 western brands such as Elizabeth Arden, L'Oreal, Clinique, Benefit Cosmetics, Kiehls, Laura Mercier, et cetera. This partnership can help Cosmecca to work closely with US cosmetics brands for sure.\n\n\\*FYI, former CEO of Englewood Lab David C. Chung will more focus on his own brand line Farmacy after he sold his shares on Englewood Lab.\n\n.\n\n>**# Research, Manufacturing facilities, & FDA warning**\n\nAs they claim they are focusing on research and innovation, Cosmecca runs 2 research & development teams (skin care lab & makeup lab). Not like Kolmar and Cosmax, currently Cosmecca focuses on cosmetics only.\n\nCosmecca's manufacturing capability is 100 million per year and 32% of their staffs are in manufacturing. As mentioned above, they have their own innovative manufacturing practice called CPS (Cosmecca Production System) with various technologies to maximize productivity with less defects.\n\nThe manufacturing facilities feature proper certificates as well: ISO 9001 (Quality management system), ISO 14001 (Environmental management systems), ISO 22716 (GMP, Good manufacturing practice for cosmetics), OHSAS18001 (British standard health and safety management system), et cetera.\n\n[Cosmecca manufacturing facilities \\(Source: Cosmecca Korea webstie\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cks0p6s3i6c11.jpg?width=848&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a534d3553c108d4dba858d005a59826eb065a112)\n\n**However**, in February 2018, Cosmecca received an [warning letter from FDA](https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm595755.htm) as they violate FDA good manufacturing practice (GMP). FDA inspected Cosmecca's facility and found that Cosmecca released over-the-counter(OTC) drug products without data to support their conformance to specifications. This means Cosmecca did not feature proper data for its OTC drug products (mostly sunscreen functional products). There are other reasons but mostly they are about them not having proper data for products they claim with function.\n\nThis actually happened to Kolmar Korea as well, actually many of Korean cosmetics manufacturers violate US GMP rules as there are not that much clear information for Korean manufacturers how they should prepare for US GMP requirements. I am quite sure it was not an intentional violation, but still, a violation is a violation. \n\n.\n\n>**# Products manufactured by Cosmecca Korea**\n\nLike Kolmar and Cosmax, Cosmecca also produces products for many different brands. I have searched 283 products of 43 different brands below, hopefully it can help you understand what products they make and how good they are through your previous experience with specific

With its acquisition of Englewood Lab, it could possibly exceed US$250 million this year.However, still they are no.3 after Kolmar Korea and Cosmax. With this circumstance, CEO Cho Im-Rae is still very positive and confident.\n\n*\"It is true that there are already those leading companies. However, Cosmecca's direction is somehow different from them. It is not always how big you are and how long you have run your business to become a leading company. Cosmecca will focus on our own direction and will become the leading OGM (Original Global Management) company both in Korea and global market.\"*\n\nI once had an opportunity to work with Cosmecca in 2016 and it was quite pleasureful. They were very nice, and I could see they were kind of enjoying developing products despite our quite hard requirements. I think this positive energy can make this company improve consistently and may make a big move in future.\n\nAlthough it's super long, hope you enjoy the post! :)",

They are not as big as Kolmar or Cosmax, however, recently they have been growing very quickly with very good reputation. They work with both big corporate brands and small niche brands, you may have experienced any of products produced by them. It's a very long post though, hope you enjoy!",

I read the statement and they're talking about Cosmecca's facility which is in Korea. Did they apply for some sort of American certificate and that's why they got inspected? Forgive me if I sound ignorant, I'm not American and I just don't quite comprehend why is an American organization issuing a warning to a company in Korea. At first I thought this has something to do with selling these products in the States but in this case shouldn't the brand be held accountable and not the manufacturer?",

    "body": "I vaguely remember signing up for the notification for Charlotte Cho's new launch about a month or so back and received an email about the opening of her new brand, '[Then I Met You](https://thenimetyou.com/),' this morning. While I only looked at Soko Glam during the very beginning of my skincare days, I know it's a popular outlet for a lot of people since it's a convenient, one-stop-shop for a lot of the most popular Asian beauty products. \n\nIt appears that Charlotte Cho wants to dive into the realm of making her own skincare products and the new brand touts a very similar story to a lot of other online-owned brands. Based on the 'Our Story' page, she's focusing on \"**natural, premium ingredients, even when it means cutting into our own margin.\"** (ok, sis).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe initial launch is a cleansing balm and a cleansing gel sold separately or as a pair. Here's the breakdown:\n\n* LIVING CLEANSING BALM (38.00 USD): **Massage this luxurious, sorbet-soft oil cleanser into the skin to melt away oil-based impurities, such as sunscreen, makeup and excess sebum while nourishing the skin with antioxidants, essential fatty acids and vitamin E.**\n\n>Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Trii-sostearate, PEG-8 Isostearate, Cera Microcristallina (Microcrystalline Wax/Cire Microcristalline), Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Ceresin, Synthetic Wax, Orbiignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Diospyros Kaki Fruit Extract, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Rosemarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Ethylene/Propylene Copolymer\n\n* SOOTHING TEA CLEANSING GEL (36.00 USD): **This premium gel cleanser with antioxidant and antibacterial properties uses gentle cleansing agents to clear skin of any impurities, without stripping the skin. The mandarin citrus scents are designed to awaken your senses during every use.**\n\n>Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Aqua (Water/Eau), Sorbitol, Glycerin, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Diethylhexyl, Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, 1,2 Hexanediol, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Diglycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Propylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Gluconolactone, Butylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, T-Butyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously, I haven't tried any of them yet but I probably won't be investing in these products. First, neither are fungal acne friendly unfortunately. Second, holy price point batman. They're expensive on their own and together they're 68.00 USD. Also, and this isn't a dig at Charlotte Cho, but the way some of these companies advertise their products as if they're absolutely revolutionary kind of blows my mind and is overdone. Cleansing balms and cleansing gels aren't new and there are only oh-so many ways you can reinvent the wheel. Does anyone else have any initial reactions?",

The texture is slightly thick and gooey(but not gross)\n\nApplication: I use 3-4 pumps for my whole face. I apply it on wet dripping face right after cleanser in the evening. On some days I layer it twice. My skin drinks it up as soon as I apply it. It spreads easily on wet skin. On dry skin it doesn't fully absorb and sits on the skin.\n\nI love it. I bought 9 bottles so far. And gifted three to my friends. You can see 4 in the photo. I gave away the old ones for recycling. I use it every day in my PM routine during winters. It helps keep my skin hydrated in dry weather. If i go a week without using it, I can feel the difference. Skin feels tight and not as glowy when i wake up. I always take it for travelling. It's helpful during flights and while staying in hotel rooms where my skin feels most dehydrated.\n\n***10/10 Will repurchase , Holy Grail!***\n\nSorry for any mistakes. This is my first review.

To stress the snails, they’re often poked with a stick or sprayed with a small amount of sodium chloride to start the stress response. The snails are in a machine that collects their slime. The snails are kept in a safe place while they recover and then are released back to their homes.\n\nIn another process, snail shells get cracked and the snail bodies are removed. The snails are washed in cold water to separate the mucin for collection.",

    "body": "I tie a plastic ice pack around my face and commence with the morning's stretching exercises. Afterwards I stand in front of a chrome and acrylic Washmobile bathroom sink - with soap dish, cup holder, and railings that serve as towel bars, which I bought at Hastings Tile to use while the marble sinks I ordered from Finland are being sanded - and stare at my reflection with the ice pack still on. I pour some Plax antiplaque formula into a stainless-steel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds.\n\nThen I squeeze Rembrandt onto a faux- tortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth (too hung over to floss properly - but maybe I flossed before bed last night?) and rinse with Listerine. Then I inspect my hands and use a nailbrush. I take the ice-pack mask off and use a deep-pore cleanser lotion, then an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I check my toenails. Then I use the Probright tooth polisher and next the Interplak tooth polisher (this in addition to the toothbrush) which has a speed of 4200 rpm and reverses direction forty-six times per second; the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces. I rinse again, with Cepacol. I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub.\nThe shower has a universal all-directional shower head that adjusts within a thirty-inch vertical range. It's made from Australian gold-black brass and covered with a white enamel finish. In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older. The conditioner is also good - silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older.\n\nOn weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs. Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale's or Bergdorf's and on Evelyn's advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation.\n\nOnce out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it - preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers - which I've found makes removing the hair easier. It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade. Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows, pressing gently on the skin. Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin.\n\nApplying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture. Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky - which makes it look dull and older - use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker). Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing \"protective\" lotion. A scalp-programming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural- bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb.\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/c2jCMqD",

Types of Hair Problems (3 Main Areas)\n\nAll common hair problems fall into one of these:\n\n1. **Hair Roots (Hair Below the Scalp)** – Hair fall, thinning, reduced density\n2. **Hair Strands (Hair Above the Scalp)** – Dryness, breakage, roughness\n3. **Scalp Issues** – Dandruff, oiliness, itching, inflammation\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧠 2. Hair Root Care – Stop Hair Fall & Grow Stronger Hair\n\nHair fall starts when hair roots weaken or hair becomes thinner. If ignored, it leads to visible scalp and low density.\n\n🛑 **Step 1: Block DHT**\n\n* **Finasteride 1 mg/day** (tablet or topical): Blocks DHT (main reason for male hair loss).\n* Recommended if hair loss is **Stage 2 or more** on Norwood scale.\n\n**💉 Step 2: Improve Blood Flow to Hair Roots**\n\n* **Minoxidil 5%**: Increases blood supply to hair follicles, delivering more nutrients.\n* Apply once or twice daily.\n* For very early hair fall (Stage 1–2), some doctors prefer starting with **caffeine-based or peptide serums** first.\n\n**💊 Step 3: Provide Proper Nutrients**\n\nEven if blood supply increases, without the right nutrients, hair won’t grow strong. Include:\n\n|Supplement|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Strengthens hair strands|\n|**Multivitamin (with Zinc, Vitamin D, and B-complex)**|Fixes hidden deficiencies|\n|**Omega-3 or Fish Oil**|Reduces inflammation, nourishes follicles|\n\n**🧪 Step 4: Peptide-Based Serums (for Root Stimulation)**\n\nThese serums contain **plant-based peptides and natural growth factors** that help activate weak or resting follicles without the side effects of stronger medications.\n\n|Serum|Key Ingredients|Benefits|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Redensyl**|DHQG + EGCG2|Activates hair stem cells, reduces hair fall|\n|**Capixyl**|Biomimetic peptide + red clover|Strengthens follicles, reduces inflammation|\n|**Anagain**|Pea sprout extract|Extends hair growth phase (anagen)|\n|**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Hair Serum**|Blend of multiple peptides|Boosts density, nourishes scalp|\n\n✅ Best used **once daily** on a dry scalp.

Hair Strand Care – Improve Hair Texture, Strength & Shine\n\nThis is the visible part of hair above the scalp. You need to:\n\n**🧴 Use Hair Oil (Carefully)**\n\n* Oil gives moisture and reduces breakage.\n* But **avoid putting oil on the scalp** too often — it can cause dandruff or feed fungus.\n* Apply oil **only on the hair length**, 1–2 times a week, and **wash off properly**.\n\n**🧼 Use Conditioner (Not on Scalp)**\n\n* After shampoo, apply conditioner **only on hair strands** to reduce dryness and tangles.\n\n**💆 Use Hair Mask (Deep Conditioning Treatment)**\n\nHair masks are like super-conditioners. Use them 1–2 times a week to:\n\n* Deeply moisturize dry hair\n* Make hair soft, smooth, and shiny\n* Reduce frizz and split ends\n\n🧴 Choose masks with ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter, keratin, or aloe vera.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧴 4.

Hard Water vs Soft Water\n\n# 🔹 Hard Water (contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Leaves behind mineral deposits on hair strands.\n   * Causes **dry, rough, dull, and brittle hair**.\n   * Can lead to **more hair breakage and tangling**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * **Clogs scalp pores**, leading to dandruff or scalp acne.\n   * May cause **itching or irritation**.\n   * Reduces the effectiveness of shampoo and conditioner (hair doesn’t feel clean).\n\n# 🔹 Soft Water (low mineral content):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Makes hair feel **softer and smoother**.\n   * Helps shampoos and conditioners work better.\n   * Prevents mineral buildup, making hair **shinier and more manageable**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * Gentle on the scalp.\n   * Helps maintain **natural oil balance**.\n\n# 🌡️ 2. Water Temperature\n\n* **Hot Water:**\n   * Strips natural oils from hair and scalp.\n   * Can cause **dryness, itching, and frizz**.\n   * May weaken hair roots over time.\n* **Cold or Lukewarm Water:**\n   * Retains natural oils.\n   * Helps **seal the hair cuticle**, making hair shinier and smoother.\n   * Best for the final rinse.\n\n# 🧪 3. Chlorinated Water (Swimming Pools)\n\n* Damages the hair shaft.\n* Causes **dryness, discoloration (especially in colored hair), and split ends**.\n* Irritates the scalp and worsens **scalp sensitivity or dandruff**.\n\n# ✅ Solutions if You Have Hard Water\n\n* Install a **shower filter** that removes minerals and chlorine. (or use filtered water from water purifier only for hair wash)\n* Use **chelating or clarifying shampoos** once a week (they remove mineral buildup).\n* Rinse with **apple cider vinegar + water (1:4 ratio)** to remove residue.\n* Apply **deep conditioning masks** to restore moisture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# # Is Finasteride Safe? Can You Take It Without Doctor Consultation?\n\n**Finasteride** (commonly used for male pattern baldness at **1 mg/day**) is generally **effective and relatively safe** when taken correctly - but **it should NOT be taken without a doctor’s consultation**, especially for long-term use.\n\n# 🔍 Why You Need Doctor Consultation\n\nFinasteride changes your **hormone levels** by reducing DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the hormone responsible for hair loss. Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it’s safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ✅ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**—though not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ⚠️ Common Side Effects (in 1–10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ⚠️ Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** – Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# 👨‍⚕️ Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# 🔍 Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely lowered)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#

        "body": "Errors in your guide which even ChatGPT cannot correct. Hence why you should not use it as a personal doctor. Allow me to correct it from using what is proven and in accordance with my knowledge. \n\nA) In section 1. Types of Hair problems. The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C. Evaluation of long‐term efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system. J Dermatol. 2019;46(2):139-143. doi:10.1111/1346-8138.14719\n\n2) Yanagisawa M, Fujimaki H, Takeda A, Nemoto M, Sugimoto T, Sato A.

Journal of Dermatological Treatment. 2022;33(4):1938-1946. doi:10.1080/09546634.2021.1959506\n\nAnd here you go. This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS. Journal of Heredity. 1916;7(8):347-355. doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110746\n\n2) Nor does wearing Hats or Helmets cause any damage to hair. Here is the study : \nTellez-Segura R. Involvement of Mechanical Stress in Androgenetic Alopecia. Int J Trichology. 2015;7(3):95-99. doi:10.4103/0974-7753.167468 \n\n3) Shoemaker JK, Tiidus PM, Mader R.

Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1997;29(5):610-614. doi:10.1097/00005768-199705000-00004\n\nConclusion : Never drive bike without Helmet and caps when going out in sun without any worries of Bludflow. \n\nC) Supplements are called supplements because they are not FDA approved. When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al. Nat Med. 2019 Dec.\n\n2) Unusual Presentation of Tinea Corporis Associated With the Use of a Microneedling Device\nNélia Margarida Martins da Cunha et al. Aesthet Surg J. 2017.\n\nE) Stop using oils if your scalp is already oily. Adding more oils will not benifit in any way. It may even create more grounds for fungal infections.",

        "body": "Please for the love of Hairs, stop asking GPT and Reddit on hair care routine. It never ends well. Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

It is sometimes difficult to determine whether it’s psoriasis or dandruff or sebhorric dermatitis, my scalp feels different after applying specific shampoos, I am still not able to figure out what works for the flakes. I feel like scratching my head and have lost some hair and it became patchy on one side where I scratched. I don’t see hair follicles there and I am afraid it’s permanent. Not sure if that hair will come back, hope its a temporary hair loss.\nwhat should be the length of hair I should keep so that its easy for me to clean. I feel like going bald, so that atleast i know where the flakes are and I clean it properly.\n\nAlso what should be the length of hair one should keep optimal for applying all the above treatments like minoxidil, dermaroller. Is a normal dermaroller better or something like dermapen is useful. Can you use same dermaroller on face after cleaning.",

    "body": "Heavy-duty moisturisers for problem facial skin. No fragrances, alchohol, parfum, or any other sensitising ingredients. These products will help to repair skin damaged by over-exfoliation and over-treatment. Also helpful for de-hydrated and inflamed acne. To get best results, use in a routine that starts with layers of humecants (thin, hydrating layers found in Asian Beauty products), and finishes with oils (rosehip, sea-buckthorn, squalane). Avoid foaming cleansers, and try OCM/gentle cleansers. \n\n\nLA ROCHE-POSAY LIPIKAR BAUME AP+: (HG). Fantastic moisturiser with shea butter and 4% niaciniamide. Hugely moisturising, thick, soothing, cosmetically elegant. Mixes with everything (oil, sillicons, hydrators), never pills. 400ml of product in big pump bottle. Love using this. Re-purchased at least 5 times so far. \n\n\nEUCERIN 5% NIGHT CREAM: Make sure you get the night cream. Much thicker than the day one. Powerful moisturiser, with 5% urea, ceramides and other clinically effective ingredients. Thick and again mixes with everything. If you want to get a urea product into your routine, this is the one. Only 50ml of product so have to be slightly more sparing, but reasonably good value for money. Re-purchased 4 or 5 times.\n\n\nLA ROCHE-POSAY CICAPLAUST BAUME B5: Very different to the previous two products, and should be used as a mixer with them, rather than a stand alone moisturiser. It is incredibly soothing and anti-irritating. With B5 and zinc, it is anti-bacterial, calming, thick. This plays a different role in routine, repairing, reducing redness. Slightly occlusive and leaves a slight whitecast, so for evening use only. Find this product to be quite unique, especially at the price point and a great addition to any routine. Re-purchased 3 times. \n\nBEPANTHENOL: Yep, nappy rash cream. Heavy, thick occlusive. Great consistency, feels very luxorious and mixes nicely with vaseline and aquaphor, making them easility spreadable. Also mixed well with creams, for a sleeping back. Ingredients listend below. None of the 'alcohol' ingredients are sensetizing, they are all fatty alchohols, like those used by cerave, that are moisturising. Ingredients: Aqua, Lanolin, Paraffinium Liquidum, Petrolatum, Panthenol (Dexpanthenol), Prunus Dulcis, Cera Alba, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Ozokerite, Glyceryl Oleate, Lanolin Alcohol. \n\nNotable mentions to Cerave Cream, Aquaphor, Vaseline, pure lanolin. \n\nI'm have lots of experience dealing with very problematic skin and associated skin conditions, so please hit me up with any questions and I hope I can impart with some of my knowledge/suggestions!",

I have the Biore Watery Essence since it was what everyone recommended but the alcohol is just way too much for my skin.

    "body": "[Manyo Factory Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Repair Skin Toner](http://manyo-factory.com/en/shop/product/hyaluronic-acid-hydrating-repair-skin-toner)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI purchased this toner about a month ago. I know only a month's use is a bit premature, and I usually do reviews of products once I have completely finished them,  but if I wait until I finish this product it will probably be 5-6 months from now.\n\n**Feel**\n\nThis toner feels really nice on the skin. It is a bit thicker than water and is totally clear. I pour a small puddle into my hand, and then pat into my skin. I apply it after using a facial spray (Caudalie Grape Water or Manyo Factory Lactobacillus Mist). I bring it up under my eyes without irritation. I even apply it to my lips.\n\n**Results**\n\nSo for skin care products that aren't actives, I sometimes feel like I don't notice any difference in my skin, and I have to wonder if it's doing anything at all. I was beginning to feel the same way about this product, but then I forgot to apply it the other day before going to work, and my skin had a slight tight feeling all day. I was definitely missing some hydration. This toner definitely hydrates my skin well, and when applied to my lips makes them plumper. I really enjoy using this, and I might even like it better than the Pyunkang Yul Essence toner that I always recommend to people looking for a hydrating toner.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nI'll include the entire ingredients list so you can see all the awesome stuff in it. I was really impressed with the ingredients list.\n\n Mineral Water, Carbonated Water, Hydrolyzed Collagen Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Sodium PCA, Urea, Uric Acid, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Magnesium Chloride, Ceramide NP, Oligopeptide-29, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Arbutin, Butylene Glycol, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Water, Methylpropanediol, Chondrus Crispus Powder, Caprylyl Glycol, Glutamic acid, Threonine, Serine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Lactic acid, Citric Acid, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Valine, Isoleucine,Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Cysteine, Xanthan Gum, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Aspartic acid \n\nYou've got ceramides, collagen, glycerin, arbutin, allantoin, urea, panthenol, amino acids, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, and plant extracts. It's a win in my book. I would bet this could help repair a damaged moisture barrier (the name says as much anyway)\n\n**Packaging**\n\nIt comes in a 250 mL bottle with a flip cap. I haven't experienced any issues with pouring out too much. I think the packaging is great, and would probably be good for traveling (obviously not on an airplane because it's too big for the liquid regulations)\n\n**Repurchase?**\n\nAbsolutely! My mom is using it too, and we both love it. It definitely makes a difference in my skin and leaves it feeling hydrated. I would recommend this to anyone needing a hydrating toner. It also layers well if you wanted to do the 7 skin method with it. I haven't done 7 layers, but have done 2 or 3 without issue. It also works well when I use it alongside the Pyunkang Yul Essence toner.",

    "body": "Hello! So beplain initially caught my attention as I’ve heard the brand was made based on customer feedback in Korea. The ingredients list for these products are relatively simple so there was little worry for breakouts. It definitely did not disappoint!\n\nA little background: I live in a humid country with dehydrated, combination, acne-prone skin. My main concerns with my skin right now is CCs, calming and hydrating.\n\n-\n**Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam** ***4.5/5 MRP***\n\n*Glycerin, Mung Bean Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Lauryl Betaine, Betaine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Powder, Dextrin, Allantoin, Water, Ceramide NP, Green Tea Powder, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nCompared to all cleansers I’ve used so far, this was probably one of the best. It’s a pretty light green with a thick paste texture, and has small bits of what seems to be mung bean. In my opinion, you can smell mung bean, just slightly, but I didn’t mind it at all as it reminds me of those asian dessert places haha. The cleanser itself foams, but for me it wasn’t stripping at all. The cleanser contains lots of extracts which could be good for the skin, but honestly since it’s a wash-off product, I couldnt feel any of the benefits :”) The downside would be the price. In my country, it is sold for $12 for 80ml, which is more expensive than any other cleansers I’ve ever used :(\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Toner** ***3.5/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract (80.65%), Propanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Cellulose Gum, Disodium EDTA, Ceramide-NP, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nOkay so this was a 3.5 for me, just because of my skin type and the weather in my country. For oily-combo skin in humid weather, this toner felt slightly too moisturizing, so it felt kind of heavy for me. This would definitely be amazing for dry skin in the summer or oily skin in the winter. It’s a runny toner with a slight slip if you rub it against your hands. I could smell a bit of the chamomile as I apply it to my face but it wasn’t overpowering at all. It was soothing, but the main thing it did for my skin was honestly the moisturizing/hydrating component. If that was what you’re looking for in a runny toner, I’d definitely recommend this!\n\n-\n**Cicaful ampoule** ***4.5/5 WRP***\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract (81.44%), Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone*\n\nI understand you probably are sick with all the cica products dominating the market, but this ampoule was *really good* for me. This ampoule is clear and very viscous, almost like a gel but still relatively runny. As you rub it on your skin it becomes like water, and sinks in reaaally quick. I’ve heard people say this was hydrating for them, but it wasn’t *that* hydrating for me. The calming effect was *amazing* though—redness in my face can minimize as soon as a few hours after application. It felt cooling and very soothing to the skin. Though I would say I run out of the bottle relatively quicker than other serums haha. If you need a calming, no fuss ampoule with minimal ingredients and low breakout risk, this is definitely one to try out!\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Lotion** ***3/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Kelp Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Purified Water, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Squalane (Plant-derived), Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide-NP, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pentylene Glycol*\n\nCompared to other lotions/emulsions I’ve tried, I don’t think I prefer this one. This lotion was a bit thick and holds it’s shape better when you try making it run down. It has the chamomile smell similar to the toner, but far more minimal that you really can’t smell it unless you’re trying to. It’s very moisturizing, probably enough if you use this as a moisturizer in the summer. It spreads well and you don’t need a lot to cover your entire face, but it sinks in less quick, so after using it, it feels like you’ve put a legit cream moisturizer on your face. This was *not* a bad product, but it’s probably better geared towards those with dry skin.\n\n-\n**Hyaluronic Aqua Moisturizer** ***4/5 WRP***\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Methyl Trimethicone, Methylpropanediol, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP, Copolymer, Raffinose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate (100ppm), Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (100ppm), Allantoin, Madecassoide, Beta-glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ethylcellulose, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-51*\n\nRight off the bat, the texture surprised me. This came out as a translucent balm-like gel with no scent, like a less strong vaseline, so for those with dehydrated skin, this one is for you! I was kinda scared using it thinking it was going to be heavy, but I have been using it at night and it’s done wonders for my skin the next morning. Perhaps because my skin is dehydrated, but with this product, my skin texture really improved. As this also was not like a very emollient moisturizer, it felt like it was a layer sealing in all the serum and toner I used before and did not feel clogging at all. Honestly, this product turned out faaaaaar better than I expected!\n\n-\n\nOverall I am really impressed with the brand. None of their products broke me out, which is incredible! All in all I’d say I recommend the cleanser and the cica ampoule for all skin types, the chamomile line for dry skin types (or combo/oily in the winter) and the aqua moisturizer for dehydrated skin. I hope this review was helpful for you and have a great day!",

Angry zits calm down and get smaller a lot faster.\n\nThe chamomile toner is moisturizing just enough for my oily skin this winter, but I can see how it can feel heavy and too moisturizing in humid climates. Still not sure about repurchasing, though.",

I know there are some options from Sidmool, Nature Republic, Cosrx and Purito.\n\nAnd now there are two more! 2sol came up with two serums recently with 10&#37; of it:\n\n1. [**2Sol Facial Recovery Booster**](http://www.2sol.co.kr/shop/item.php?gid=1804240003) **10% Niacinamide +  Vitamin C derivative and Panthenol 10% in total.** 30ml drop bottle\n\n\\*Purified water, niacinamide (10&#37;), 2-O-ethyl ascorbic acid, panthenol, butylene glycol, ascorbyl glucoside, dipropylene glycol, 1,2-hexanediol, glycerin, glycereth-26, palmitoyldipeptide-7, palmitoyltripeptide-1, palmitoyltetrapeptide-7, palmitoylhexapeptide-12, , Mictricaria extract, chestnut tree extract, saccharide isomerate, acetylglucosamine, tromethamine, glyceryl acrylate / acrylic acid copolymer, xanthan gum, allantoin, sodium hyaluronate, PVEM / EEE polymer, ethylhexyl glycerin, disodium dipentaerythritol\n\n\\**Unfortunately 2sol states their ingredients as a pic on Korean, so this list I took from one of the ebay sellers*\n\n2. [**2Sol Niacinamide 10% Treatment** ](http://www.2sol.co.kr/shop/item.php?gid=1804240002)**10% Niacinamide + 1% of D-panthenol. 30ml drop bottle**\n\n*I could not find the full ingredient list so far*\n\nAnd as always, these products from 2sol are fairly priced: 8900 won and 5900 won (around $8 and $5). But of course there will be some extra charges.\n\nI'll try to find or translate the full ingredients lists over the next few days.",

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me.

A little background about my skin: I have combination skin, leaning towards oily (especially during these summer months). I've been using this sub as a guide in my quest to \"perfect\" my routine. While the journey was quite expensive, I've learned that my skin tends to react that a number of common ingredients (most AHAs and BHAs are too harsh for me, coconut oil and most of derivatives, niacinamide, essential oils, high concentrations of hyaluronic acid). I was getting frustrated as I just needed a perfectly effective and safe toner for my nitpicky skin. Lo and behold--\n\n**TONER**: **ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner**\n\nWhile this might not be popular on this sub, it seems to be well loved in Korea (EXO's Suho is known to use this toner, I've also come across a few youtubers who swore by it). Heartleaf or Houttuynia Cordata Extract has been a rising ingredient lately. It's known to soothe sensitive skin, protect the skin from external irritations, and maintain oil-moisture balance.\n\n***Does it live up to its claims?*** Yes. After using this toner for 2.5 weeks, I've noticed that my skin texture is smoother after weeks of mask acne. I've been developing constant ccs due to the trapped humidity and heat of the mask around my jaw, but this toner has calmed down a lot of my irritation and texture. The consistency is very watery, so I often put 2-3 layers and I've found that my skin has been generally more resilient throughout the day (less redness, less oil). Most youtubers seem to use it for toner masking, which I will soon try! It does seem to be more soothing than hydrating, but hydrating nonetheless. I find myself waking up to completely replenished skin when I pair it with my SIDMOOL Royal Honey Peptide Deep Moisture Pack. This toner has reached HG status.\n\n***Any cons?*** It is quite pricey at $26.00 for 250 ml, some sites even have it listed as $30-45. I personally find it worth it, as I've tried too many to count that did not work for me (PKY, soonjung, cezanne, hada labo, kiku). It is also less accessible, but I know yesstyle recently started carrying their whole line and for the cheapest available price!\n\n*Full List of Ingredients:*\n\n*Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Panthenol, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract,* ***Butylene Glycol***\\*, Vitex Agnus-Castus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Malus Domestica Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Isopentyldiol, Methylpropanediol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA\\*\n\nThe ingredients are very clean-- as reiterated throughout their branding. Unless you have an allergy to any of the extracts, or an extreme sensitivity to butylene glycol (which I sometimes do have, but this toner seems to work as butylene is farther down the list), I can't see it wreaking havoc on most skin. Perhaps, the worst case is it does nothing. YMMV of course (!!), but I've never been so impressed with a product that I've been compelled to post about it. Sensitive skin girls, unite! Thank you for reaching the bottom of this page. <3",

It feels like a thick moisturising layer of petroleum jelly on the lips. \n\n**Colour** This variant has a pinkish tint but it’s not that visible when applied on the lips. It has a slight rosy fragrance. \n\nAfter application it looks a little shiny on the lips. Not over the top glossy. It leaves a beautiful sheen on the lips. \n\n**Thoughts** ~ The staying power is pretty good. I rarely need to reapply anything throughout the day. It keeps the lips moisturised\nthroughout the day. My lips don’t dry up easily so that’s a factor too. I didn’t notice my lips flaking or cracking up after a few hours of usage which I’ve experienced with some lip balms in order to keep reapplying them. It’s great to use this under lipstick as well. \nIf you use this at nighttime, you’ll wake up with the most beautiful and hydrated lips in the morning. 💋\nAbsolutely love this. 💕\n\nThe only drawback is the tin packaging. Looks quite aesthetic but it is a pain to open the lid. 😭 \n\n\n**Final thoughts** ~ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ \nHG will definitely repurchase. 🛍️",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

It absorbs faster and doesn’t leave any noticeable residue, making it a good option for daytime use.",

    "body": "I've had scalp sebderm (SD) since 2019, but I was only diagnosed with it at the end of 2022. My symptoms were as follows:\n\n1. Dry scalp with minor flaking\n2. Inflammed scalp, to the point where it would hurt to move my hair\n3. Extreme hair loss (Telogen effluvium)\n4. Itchy scalp\n\nIn addition to this, I was deficient in Vitamin D and Iron. This was the first thing I fixed! The second was eating like shit. I was constantly spiking my insulin by eating carbs and sugar. I cut these down by ALOT. I still enjoy carbs and sugar occasionally because otherwise what is the point of even living lol.\n\nAfter getting diagnosed, my Derm prescribed Ketoconazole 2% and Ciclopirox lotion. These did not work long term. I scoured this sub for hours and came across many recommendations. This [Post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how_i_got_severe_sebderm_and_hair_loss_under/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) was tremendously helpful and I followed this user's recommendations somewhat. Primarily the 3 step solution of:\n\n1. **Destroy the biofilm -** I used white vinegar. I did not have any open wounds on my scalp so I just used full strength vinegar. I would spray it on my scalp and let it sit for about 10 mins after working it in with a silicone scalp massager and would jump in the shower after.\n2. **Kill Malassezia -** I used selenium sulphide shampoo in the shower after step 1. I let the shampoo sit in my scalp for 5 mins while I worked it in with the silicone scalp massager. After showering, I used butenafine hcl cream in my scalp (follow the frequency of application directions on the label, twice a day for 1 week (morning and night), or once a day for 4 weeks ), along with MCT oil for moisture. I followed step 1 and step 2 religiously for about 2 months. Edit: one month is probably enough TBH. A word of caution, antifungals are not meant for long term use. Long term use can cause more problems down the road!\n3. **Heal the skin barrier -** After following step 1 and 2, I switched to using a gentler shampoo that is pH balanced. I used Aveeno fresh greens blend (Aveeno has other scents in this line that will also work) which has a pH of 4-5. Maintaining the pH of the skin is extremely important, I will explain this later. I lather it up using a scalp scrubber and let it sit in my hair for 5 mins then rise. After showering, while my hair is damp, I spray into my scalp a DIY scalp spray that has aloe vera gel, green tea extract, Panthenol (vitamin B5), and Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) . I also spray into my scalp [Cerave toner](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Non-Alcoholic-Niacinamide-Fragrance-Free-Comedogenic/dp/B09LKXR62L/ref=asc_df_B09LKXR62L/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=563553100281&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6424457079212929978&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1022698&hvtargid=pla-1569188073041&psc=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS09kwvqxV5zyv1b2xGgv5AJOf9TWWPmHuoXSN9QGQyYg3YJqxa6XSMaApzKEALw_wcB) because it has ceramides. Edit: I use the DIY spray and cerave toner as leave-ins after my shower. About once a week, I will also do an overnight scalp treatment using glycolic acid toner from The Ordinary and will wash out in the morning using method described earlier in step 3. The key players to healing your scalp/skin here are: *pH balance using acids and pH balanced products, niacinamide, panthenol,* and *ceramides*. Step 3 is now my full routine, I wash my hair about 2-3 times a week.\n\nThis is my contribution to this sub!!\n\n**Maintaining pH balance**\n\nThis is extremely important! You can do this by using acids such as vinegar or glycolic acid (I prefer glycolic since it doesn't smell and not as harsh as vinegar) and using pH balanced shampoos. Most shampoos have a pH of 6 or higher, but I'm going to stick to shampoo with pH that is closer to what my skin prefers, which is pH of 4-5. Research shows that the skin likes to be at a more acidic pH and the ideal is around 4-5. Research also shows that skin with pH below 5 is in a healthier state than skin with pH above 5. Additionally, skin which tends to be acidic is better for the good microflora that help your skin, and is not ideal for Malassezia. Malassezia prefers a more alkaline environment to thrive.\n\nHere are some sources to back up what I'm saying:\n\n1. [Natural skin surface pH is on average below 5, which is beneficial for its resident flora](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18489300/)\n2. [Higher pH level, corresponding to that on the skin of patients with atopic eczema, stimulates the release of Malassezia sympodialis allergens](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2006.01108.x)\n3. [pH-Dependent Expression, Stability, and Activity of Malassezia restricta MrLip5 Lipase](https://anndermatol.org/pdf/10.5021/ad.2020.32.6.473)\n\nI'm sure there are a ton more sources, these are just a few.\n\nAdditional things to note:\n\n* I stopped using products that contain ingredients that feed the fungus. I use [https://sezia.co/](https://sezia.co/) to help me. the only exception I make is the Aveeno shampoo I use, which only has one ingredient.\n* my hair is thick and curly (3b)!\n* I am extremely active, gym 4-5 days a week, and eat many fruits and veggies, lots of protein and complex carbs (sometimes yummy carbs too)\n* I take vitamins! Vitamin D, Iron, Omega 3s, B complex, magnesium, K2, Vitamin C, Zinc + copper\n* I take probiotics! Kimchi, Kefir, yogurt, and sometimes in [pill form](https://www.gardenoflife.com/raw-probiotics-ultimate-care-vegetarian-capsules?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_5unBhCMARIsACZyzS38cUzlAtzqFM8SuYnwJPt3W1TRWdnrI-pUdcIGBeIDXZ0jL0azgkQaApOtEALw_wcB)\n\n**The results from following the 3 step protocol:**\n\nMy symptoms are pretty much gone! No itch, no inflammation, my hair doesn't hurt when I move it, my scalp isn't dry and I have no flakes. My hair is growing back from all that hairloss!\n\nIt has been about a month and I haven't needed to use antifungals. My scalp hasn't felt this good in a LONG time.\n\nI hope this post helps!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: DIY scalp spray recipe\n\nI measured out about 4-6g of [niacinamide](https://www.amazon.com/Talsen-Chemicals-Niacinamide-Vitamin-Cosmetic/dp/B08RRLPM4Y/ref=sr_1_9?crid=EQ9RVNFBR11F&keywords=niacinamide+powder&qid=1692927230&sprefix=niaci%2Caps%2C163&sr=8-9) and 4-6 g [Panthenol](https://www.amazon.com/Provitamin-dl-Panthenol-Moisturizer-Talsen-Chemicals/dp/B08VRX75NW/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=panthenol&qid=1692927191&sr=8-14) and add it to a spray bottle, then add in however much [aloe vera gel](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Aloe-Vera-Gel-Skin/dp/B098BFY517/ref=sr_1_15?crid=1R9XYMG37XDP6&keywords=aloe+vera+gel&qid=1692927704&sprefix=aloe+v%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-15) you want, up to 50% of the volume even. then add in [witch hazel](https://www.amazon.com/Dickinsons-Witch-Hazel-Astringent-Ounce/dp/B000VV0E90/ref=sr_1_35?crid=GTUL2Z4EUMGA&keywords=witch+hazel+toner&qid=1692927568&sprefix=witch+hazel%2Caps%2C175&sr=8-35) so the total volume comes to 100 ml. give it a good shake to dissolve the solids and its ready! cerave toner works in a pinch too. I use these as a leave-in after showering FYI\n\nUpdate (11/13/2023):\n\nI went to another derm today for another issue and asked her to take a look at my scalp to determine if the sebderm is getting better and she said she didn’t see any signs of it! This indicates to me that this treatment is working at controlling it :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

How I didn't go crazy suffering through the itchiness and burning I DO NOT KNOW lol. My derm also prescribed  Ketoconazole 2% and I believe a steroid cream for when there is a flare up. I haven't used the cream yet because I hadn't needed it.\n\nBefore the prescription I was using T-Sal and Nizoral after trying Briogeo which only helped severe flare ups (because of it's cooling ingredients) but then the problems were still there. Before that it was Head & Shoulders in combination with my regular shampoos and conditioners. That didn't seem like it helped much either but I just thought that's what I had to use. The T-Sal and Nizoral seemed to work well except the T-Sal which I think dried out my hair. Nizoral was convenient because I could get it at the store and it does have 1% Ketoconazole. As I got low on my 2% I opted for Nizoral and it had been working well although I think I do need that extra 1%.\n\nWith winter starting to hit I am noticing more itchiness and flakes which I'm honestly real sad about because I feel like I was just improving. I've been on this regimen I think for a year or so.  I have moved a few cities over and am in a home with possibly more dust although we have air purifiers running. I have lost weight and am trying to eat better. I can't tell what my triggers are really for my SD but I'm trying to take note.\n\nI just have a few questions. Did you use conditioner before your treatment? Also, do you use leave in creams, dry shampoo, gels, oils, etc. I have curly hair and definitely need some product which is a shame because I'm sure it effects my SD. I can tell certain gel/creams will add a lot of build up and cause flakes so I use them less often or ditch them. Would be great to hear everyone else's experience too. Thanks again for this amazing post! I hope my long ass notes help someone else too.",

HG and have already repurchased, 5/5\n\n**haruharu wonder - Unscented Black Rice Moisture 5.5 Soft Cleansing Gel**\n*ferments, rice extracts, ginseng, beta glucan*\nanother absolutely lovely product, in a similar vein to the radiance balm with the ferments and nice clean but non-stripping feel. foams up well but i do give it a good long massage onto my face so sometimes i dash a little extra water onto my face to keep it foamy. it's unscented but does still have a smell - just a clean skincare product smell, which i imagine is the surfactants, so it's very very subtle and inoffensive. would be another instant repurchase except unblemish was out of stock and stylevana wouldn't have it in stock for 30! days so i ordered a couple of different 2nd step cleansers to try. so still a HG, the only problem here is my own inpatience (and like, a need for some sort of cleanser for when this runs out) 5/5\n\nnote on the cleansers: i really think with the research i did and general luck that i ended up with a great combination of cleansers here. i think the ferments do play a good part in conditioning my skin, i was worried that they'd leave me with a negative reaction as they don't appear to work well for everyone but i'm glad i took the risk!\n\n**SKIN1004 - Madagascar Centella Poremizing Clear Toner**\n*centella, 'pink himalayan' salt, panthenol, 3x hyaluronic acids, salicylic acid, glycolic acid*\na semi-confusing one for me. it's a very good spot treatment - i have a horrible habit of picking spots when i get anxious, and if i hold a cotton pad with this toner on on top of the popped/squeezed spot, by the next morning the actual spot is gone and dried up and only little scabs and redness remain. but as a full face toner, it's just not hydrating enough, even with my oily skin, and honestly it's a bit stripping because i do use a LOT of toner (my bottle is almost empty after a month). looking at the ingredients and description it seems to want to do everything all at once, which is a tough goal to set yourself when you're only a toner. i also don't enjoy salt as a 'star' ingredient, i believe that's what leads to the stripping feeling, and it's a shame because there's SO many nice ingredients at lesser volumes than the salt in this and i feel like they don't stand a chance of working. i've brought some other toners to try, however i might repurchase this as i've never used anything so effective at nerfing a spot. MRP, 3.5/5\n\n**Dr. Ceuracle - Vegan Kombucha Tea Essence**\n*ferments, green tea, centella*\nso i went through a patch this month where the skin around my eyes was SO dry and sensitive, and this was the only thing that calmed it down and didn't sting. it feels like it calms my skin down almost instantly, especially in inflamed patches around spots. it's very rich, in both product and packaging, and the smallest amount goes a very long way. i've barely even made a dent in my bottle, but then i can only use it at night. why? it leaves a 'film' on my skin, like it's never truly soaked in, and this is something my oily self definitely does not need in the mornings. this is such a shame as everything else about it is so nice, and i wonder if maybe it's just not the best product for someone with oily skin. there isn't anything that controls oil in it, after all. it's also expensive LMAO but it's going to last me a ridiculous amount of time so it kind of evens out. MRP, 4/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Glow Serum**\n*propolis, niacinamide, centella, tea tree, betaine salicylate*\ni was expecting to love this one as it has niacinamide, but the main ingredient here is the 60% propolis and the niacinamide is formulated at only 2%. i use and reap the benefits of using a stronger niacinamide serum in the morning, and i enjoy a 2% boost in the evening, but the main component propolis here just does nothing for me. there's also 0.5% betaine salicylate which is a nice bonus but just isn't enough for an effect on my pores. the texture is fine, it's nice and i'll finish it, but i wouldn't repurchase as the main ingredient just doesn't seem to work or do anything for me WNRP, 2.5/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Revive Serum**\n*ginseng, snail mucin, niacinamide, licorice, 3x hyaluronic acids*\nmy first introduction to snail, it's only in a small amount here (3%) but i wanted to make sure my skin didn't react badly to snail before i went a brought a high% snail treatment. and it doesn't! my skin absolutely loved this serum and it's made me want to look at not on snail, but ginseng as well as main ingredients in my routine. it made my skin feel moist without being... oily lmao, and i also noticed texture improvements around my spots/scars/pores on my cheeks where my skin texture is the worst. It's also very non-sticky and thin and soaks in well! MRP but i'm going to buy seperate snail and ginseng products to try them more in depth first, 5/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Calming Serum**\n*green tea, mugwort, panthenol, centella, sodium hyaluronate*\ni've only used this a few times when my skin has been particularly angry, and it does what it says on the tin - overall calms inflammation and takes any sting out. i do need to use it more before i can post a conclusion and rating for it though! \n\n**Beauty of Joseon** - Glow Deep Serum**\n*rice extracts, alpha-arbutin, niacinamide, panthenol*\nhave not used this one yet! more rice extracts though which seem to work lovely on my skin, so i'm hopeful!\n\n**AXIS-Y - Dark Spot Correcting Serum**\n*niacinamide, squalane^, sodium hyaluronate, rice extracts, sea buckthorn*\nit doesn't do anything for me, atall, and something in it doesn't agree with my skin as i found that when i put it on my patches of acne, it not only didn't bring down an inflammation, but it brought up CCs around those areas. 5% niacinamide is not enough for me when my skin laps up and loves 10% on the daily. i applied this to areas where i have light scarring, dark spots etc. as well as patches where i had a spot developing and patches where spots were 'going away' and it did absolutely 0. glad i just brought the mini, WNRP 0/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Red Bean Water Gel**\n*red bean extracts, panthenol, beta glucan, 3x peptides*\nthis is really, really good at controlling sebum/oil throughout the day, and i can get very oily. it is a gel texture and doesn't feel like a moisturiser which i have mixed opinions about - like, i know it's a gel and not a cream, but i want my moisturiser to feel moisturising if that makes sense. i don't feel that it /adds/ any benefit to my skin, the benefit is in the oil control itself. definitely a gel for oily people and not those who are dry, 100%. i think it's great as a standalone moisturiser in my morning routine, but for my night routine i do want to add (and have ordered) a more hydrating and enriching (but NOT TOO RICH) cream. MRP, 4.5/5\n\n**Beauty of Joseon - Dynasty Cream**\n*rice extracts, ginseng, niacinamide, squalane^, 3x hyaluronic acids*\nthis is a beautiful product but i'm not sure what tree i was barking up when i thought it was remotely for me and my skin. this is thick, rich and super hydrating and it's way way too much for my oily skin. it sits on my skin and in my pores - truthfully, if i look at my nose an hour or two after using this i can actually see the oil sitting in my pores - and it just doesn't seem to soak in all the way. i think it also worsened the spots on my cheeks when i used it, much like the axis-y serum. lovely around my eyes though and i have been putting the tiniest amount under them when the skin is sore and dry, and it actually cleared up the dry/red/damaged skin i had in the very far corners of my eyes in a couple of days, which is a testament to it not being a bad product, just the wrong product for me and my skin type. i'm never going to get through the pot if i use it as an eye cream though so i'm going to pass it on to my mum who will probably benefit from it. WNRP, 1/5 for my skin (type), not bad just not for me\n\n^ i'll be avoiding squalane in skincare for the foreseeable. process of deduction, it seems to be something that does not agree with my skin, especially acne/spot wise.\n\n2nd picture!\n**COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner**\n*glycolic acid, betaine salicylate, panthenol*\nthis was something on my list-to-by, even at full price. i've tried one AHA/BHA product before, the non-AB infamous 30% AHA 2% BHA peeling solution, and hated it because it just stung like crap and did nothing for my skin - now after researching, i know why! with oily, acne-prone skin i knew it was worth giving a more mild AHA/BHA product a go, and this came up as top choice. i love it, i use it 3x a week and even then it's already making a big difference. the first time i used it it seemed to make the pores on my forehead vanish, i've never looked so so smooth!! i really think this is helping to prevent my breakouts at the moment, even on my cheeks which are my main problem areas. it smells like it has alcohol in it which freaked me out a bit at first, but double-checking the ingredients, it doesn't! WRP 5/5, but might also look at different AB AHA/BHA products too\n\n**Mary & May Niacinamide + Chaenomeles Sinesis Serum**\n*chaenomeles sinesis (chinese quince), niacinamide*\nhaven't tried this yet, so no rating! i brought it to replace my non-AB morning 10% niacinmide before i realised it's only 2% niacinamide. i should read things before i buy them, but still it sounds like a great serum and i'll cycle it into my night routine at some point. it was £7, which is a bargain.\n\n**Mary & May CICA Tea Tree Soothing Wash Off Pack**\n*centella, tea tree, calamine*\nclay masks scare me - all of the western ones i've tried are stripping and drying as all hell. i saw this reduced at £6 and saw the centella in it and thought that if any clay mask is for me, it would be one like this. it is really, really nice, it has a fresh smell from the tea tree, it spreads on nicely and dries pretty quickly, and most importantly when i wash it off, i don't feel like i've sucked all of the moisture out of my skin. i'm only using it twice a week, not on AHA/BHA nights, and would probably not use it much more than that, but it's a nice way to get a boost of my much loved centella in my routine whilst still being a really good antidote for all of my oil and blocked pores with the tea tree. MRP if i find for a great price again, it's just not something i NEED in my routine, but it is a nice extra! also i want to try M&Ms other wash off packs lmao 4/5",

I had to test the products adequately before making my mind about them. Other than the products in the picture, I purchased the Milk Protein Shampoo Bar as well. Overall I am very angry at myself for trying these products out.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **0.5% FERULIC ACID, 15% VITAMIN C, 1% VITAMIN E MULTIVITAMIN AGE DEFENSE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C, Alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, D Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate)\n\n***My experience:***  This is the product I was the most excited about. Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum. It was clear when it arrived but has turned slightly yellow now.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Took a picture of the vitamin C serum. It turned slightly yellow now. It was clear when it arrived.](https://preview.redd.it/a5ikili8bjg51.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd81bcb46e515122c37d2f0c79d1440712e1a2f0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **COPPER TRIPEPTIDE + PHYTO CERAMIDE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phospholipids (and Sphingolipids, Copper tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.))\n\n***My experience:*** I wanted to include copper-peptides in my routine after Gothamista raved about them. I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

It seems like most of them aren’t even hiring proper chemists and cosmetic formulators but rather reading up on what’s popular abroad and DIYing in their kitchen because they believe the Indian consumer isn’t educated enough to check PH. so thanks for doing that. Also if one batches PH went wrong I hope they weren’t being cheap and informed the other people who purchased from that batch and refunded them. Or else they’re literally endangering those customers skin",

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

    "body": "Review Day 1/7\nI recently purchased most of the new acne line by Pyunkang yul and I'm pleasantly surprised.\nUnlike the minimal ingredients the other lines have has these products contain a whole list of beneficial ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Licorice Root extract, Niacinamide, a peptide complex as well as many more. The star ingredients for this line is white willow Extract and Forsythia fruit extract. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Toner:\nIt's very watery so great for those with oily skin. It absorbs pretty quickly and has a sweet scent despite it not having any essential oils. After two weeks of using it I prefer the essence toner to it but it did help with the breakout I had and helped with clearing out my pores but it's not hydrating enough for me to see using in the long term. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser:\nMade with almost the exact same stuff but includes Citric acid and other agents for cleansing the skin. I'm not going to lie I love the cleanser it's so gentle and uses micro bubble technology. You might be disappointed that it doesn't lather well but I don't really care abut that aspect. It's a thicker consistency than their ato cleanser and 500ml cleanser but thinner than the foaming cleanser and has a pH of 5.5-6. My friend tested the pH on her one and she got a pH of almost 5.8. It also doesn't strip me of any moisture i feel more hydrated after cleansing. I'll definitely repurchase when I run out i prefer it over the Cosrx salicylic acid cleanser or my cereve hydrating cleanser. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Spot Cream:\nI got this for my sister but tried some myself I didn't really notice any difference on my skin but my sister who has sensitive acne prone skin saw improvements on her acne. I prefer to my a'pieu pimple patches over it. \n\nThis line is perfect for acne prone sensitive skin while people like me that has combo- dry skin might not like it as much it. \n\nEdit (I think their listed on cosdna if you want to check what is what) : Ingredients for the cleanser\nWater Cocamidopropyl Betaine Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate PEG-75 Acrylates Copolymer Glycerin Disodium cocoamphodipropionate PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Sodium Chloride Copper Tripeptide-1 Allantoin Citric acid Potassium Hydroxide Sodium Benzoate Phenoxyethanol Disodium EDTA\n\nIngredients for the toner:\nWater Butylene Glycol Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Niacinamide Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Glycerin Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\nSpot cream ingredients \n\nWater Pentylene Glycol Glycerin Behenyl Alcohol Cetearyl Alcohol Niacinamide Glyceryl Stearate Dimethyl Sulfone Silica Polyacrylate-13 Polyisobutene Polysorbate 20 Allantoin Madecassoside Asiaticoside Panthenol Pyridoxine HCl Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Xanthan Gum Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\n*For the cleanser and toner everything has an EWG rating lower than 3 these are all available in sale on style korean for $10 USD and under (shipping was dreadful to Canada its probably good if you live in the US) \n\nEdit x2? I just saw it on yesstyle too and they are doing a sale on the products as well . To clarify i broke out by using the moisture cream from this brand I added those products plus olivarrier products to sooth my skin. I'm planning on reviewing that brand later this week \n",

With this in mind I wonder why TO and the other brands listed double-dosed its Niacinamide to sensitive levels when 5% is really the amount you need in terms of the scientific studies conducted. More isn't always better! Same goes to retinol/tret, vit C, AHA/BHA, and basically any active you can find... lol",
