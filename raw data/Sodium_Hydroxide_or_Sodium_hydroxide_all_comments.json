    "body": "So with the new year, there are probably a lot of people resolving to cook more, cook healthier stuff, or just generally step up their kitchen game. \n\nPart of this might involve new cookware. If you're in the market, you may want to consider cast iron. Cast iron is fairly inexpensive, and is good because properly maintained, it will last forever (no really, like \"pass down to your great-grandkids in perfect condition\" forever) and is about 80-90% as nonstick as \"real\" nonstick pans. Because cast iron retains a lot of heat, it also makes cooking certain things a lot better / easier. It can also go in the oven, on a grill, or even a campfire, so it's versatile. \n\nCast iron is great, but pretty much every time it comes up on Reddit, and ESPECIALLY on other websites, a lot of misinformation about cast iron and how difficult it is to use / maintain gets thrown around. \n\nThis article gets it pretty much right, however: https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/the-truth-about-cast-iron.html\n\nStill, the myths and misinformation persist.  Even fans of cast iron seem to be putting in too much effort, if you ask me. \n\nPeople say: Cast iron is hard to clean, you need a chainmail thing, or you have to scrub it with salt, or you can't use soap, etc.  None of this is true. (don't use steel wool, though.)\n\nPeople say: Can't cook acidic things like tomato sauce in cast iron.  Not even remotely true. I make tomato sauce like, weekly in mine. \n\nPeople say: You have to keep oil in it or re-season it every time you clean it.  Nope. Maybe every few months.\n\nPeople say: you can't use metal utensils with it, it will damage the seasoning.  WRONG. \n\nRather than go through each one and try to debunk it in detail, I'll just describe how I use cast iron.  I've been doing most of my cooking in a cast iron pan for about 8 years now and I'm still a huge fan of it, even though I have a handful of \"nonstick\" pans at my disposal. \n\nHow to be good at cast iron: \n\n1. Get the biggest pan you feel works for your arm strength.  One bad (?) thing that IS true about cast iron is it's heavier.  Some places today are making nicer, thinner pans - worth a look.  \n\n2. Read this: http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/ - it's mostly right about how to season the pan.  One thing not covered in there is how to avoid getting bits of lint from paper towels, cloths, etc stuck in the seasoning.  If you figure it out, please let me know.  It doesn't ruin it but it bugs me. \n\n3. Add one or two layers of seasoning to the new pan.  (NOTE: one thing Cantor's article doesn't cover is 'breaking in' the pan after seasoning.  I don't understand the chemistry very well, but for whatever reason, trying to fry an egg on a freshly seasoned pan goes HORRIBLY for me every time.  Like it bonds to the seasoning and just wrecks it.  Sticks worse than if you just tried to cook on bare metal. Cook a few not-very-sticky things with lots of oil before going back to eggs.)\n\n4. Cook some stuff. As long as you use a decent amount of oil or other fat to cook (which you should do anyway) you won't have problems with sticking, even fish can be cooked in cast iron if you're careful.  If your food is sticking there is something wrong with your seasoning, or the pan is dirty. \n\n5. Using a flat-edged metal spatula, scrape off as much stuck-on food as you can while you're cooking. (This should only be a little bit here and there depending on what you cooked.)\n\n6. After you're done cooking (you can do this any time, doesn't have to be right away) heat up the pan on the stove, pretty hot but not smoking or burning the remaining food.  While it's still hot, spray the pan with water in the sink or run water over it in the sink.  This steams off stuck-on food.  While it's still hot, use a scrubbing brush to remove any remaining stuck-on food.  Should take about 30 seconds.  About 2/3 of the time, this is enough to get the pan clean enough to use again. If any stuck-on food remains, just scrub the pan with a sponge and soap like you would anything else. \n\n7. Dry the pan off thoroughly. (another thing that's true about cast iron - it's a bad idea to leave it wet). \n\n8. Go back to step 4. \n\n9. If you find that the pan is starting to stick more, make sure it's *thoroughly* clean and go back to step 3.  For an extra clean, I use a magic eraser after the coarse scrubber, and lots of soap.  (NB: You can kind of cheat by seasoning on the stove for a few minutes.  What I do for a half-assed seasoning layer is put on a nice thin coat of oil, heat until it starts smoking, wipe it AGAIN to remove excess, then turn off the heat and put a lid on the pan. I do this maybe once every 2-3 months. )\n\n10. If the pan is well and truly fucked for some reason, soak it in lye (pure potassium or sodium hydroxide) overnight to remove all of the seasoning, and start over at step 3, except do 5-6 layers intead of 1-2. If it has major rust you may also need to soak in a vinegar solution.  (Note: lye is dangerous, don't fuck with it without goggles and shit)\n\nThis is the general SOP I've come up with to make use of cast iron with a minimum of effort.  If you think about it, the only thing that varies from a 'nonstick' or steel pan is that you have to fix up the seasoning once in a while. The fact that you CAN do this is really the whole advantage of cast iron.  Rather than replace the pan when the nonstick properties fade, you can fix it yourself using regular-ass vegetable oil and a paper towel. (they say flaxseed oil is the best, but I haven't found that it matters very much.  Just use a very pure / refined oil, olive oil with lots of bits of olive floating in it is not good, for example)  Not exactly rocket science. \n\nI find that this is an easy trade-off for a pan that doesn't involve PTFE or similar crap, and isn't going in the trash if the nonstick coating gets scratched.  Cast iron seasoning is actually a lot tougher than teflon or similar coatings. \n\nI've cooked most of my food in cast iron for years.  My $20 pan from Aldi has outlasted the fancy Scanpan nonstick I got as a gift by several years and shows no sign of slowing down. \n\nAnyway, hope this is helpful if anyone is planning to upgrade their kitchen gear this year. \n\n",

After washing I wipe it dry and throw it back on the stove to heat up and evaporate any lingering water. I then quickly wipe a thin sheen of cooking oil over it while hot and leave it. That‚Äôs it. It stays perfectly seasoned, I can cook eggs or fish without any sticking and it doesn‚Äôt rust. All of the funky instructions for maintaining these things are silly.

One myth that I keep trying to break on r/castiron is that simply cooking bacon or other fatty foods in the pan is the same as seasoning.  It is not.  Seasoning requires a very thin layer of fat to be heated at a high enough temperature, and for long enough, to polymerize and carbonize.  Once that happens, it is extremely durable (try to scrub off the baked on oils inside your oven with just soap and water).\n\nBut my experience also concurs with yours that a freshly seasoned surface is not as non-stick as one that has been used for a while.  \n\nI'd also urge people with the time and inclination to check flea markets, antique stores (often overpriced, though) and even garage sales (estate sales at older homes can be great) for the older iron with the machined cooking surfaces.  Take a look at any Griswolds you find, but unless you see a ridiculously low price, pass them by and wait for a Wagner or even an unnamed pan.",

    "body": "\nNgayong araw i-rereview ko ang Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Bago pa na-i-launch yung tinted sunscreen ng same brand, sobrang hype nito sa Tiktok, at marami na ding mga content creators sa Tiktok ang nakapagreview dito. Magbabahagi lamang ako dito ng point of view ko bilang isang cosmetic chemist at titingnan at magkukumento ako sa mga technical na detalye na nakapaloob dito sa produkto na ito. \n\nBago ang lahat, binili ko itong product sa legitimate na distributor ng brand sa Tiktok. Marami na kasi akong napanuod na videos nung CEO ng brand na kung saan sinabi nya na pinepeke daw ang product na ito. Gusto ko lang na lehitimong product ang gagawan ko ng review. Saktong sakto din na fresh batch yung dumating kong order, dahil kita naman sa batch code nito na nitong April 2025 lang ito na-produce. \n\nPagkabukas ko pa lamang ng product, ang unang bumungad sa akin ay ang fragrance nito. May kalakasan ang fragrance nito na may floral at milky scent. Maaring di akma ang produkto na ito sa mga end user na may sensitivity sa mga fragrance. \n\nSunod kong napansin ay yung kulay nito. Makikita nyo sa pic na kulay pink itong product. Mahalaga itong property na ito ng sunscreen kaya balikan ko ito mamaya. \n\nKapag inilagay na sa daliri yung product para sukatin ito bago ipahid sa balat, napansin ko na medyo nagtutubig or nagiging runny. Babalikan ko din ito mamaya pagdating natin sa analysis ng ingredient list nitong product. \n\nKapag ipinahid na ito sa balat, lightweight naman ang texture nito. Madaling ma-blend at walang white cast, na ok para sa moreno kong balat. Wala din akong napansin na pilling o paglilibag during application nitong sunscreen. So far, so good. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list:\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root Extract), Phenoxyethanol, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nKung nabasa nyo na yung previous review ko sa Hikari Premium Sun Perfect Tinted Sunscreen Broad Spectrum, lahat ng typographic errors  at maling INCI name ng ingredient na nasa ingredient list ay nandito din sa Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Ang kinaibahan lang, yung tinted, may Niacinamide at Vitamin E. \n\nNgayon, balikan natin yung kulay nitong sunscreen na ito. Sa ingredient list, wala akong makita na ingredient na naging dahilan kung bakit naging kulay pink itong sunscreen. Walang colorant na ginamit. Sa mga nakalistang ingredients, walang isa jan ang kulay pink. So kung ano man ang nakakapagpa-pink jan ay hindi nakadeclare. Bakit kaya? \n\nBalikan naman natin yung napansin ko na nagtutubig yung product kapag in-contact na sa daliri. Marami akong nakitang users na sa Tiktok na nagtataka bakit daw watery or nagtutubig yung sunscreen. Dahil yan sa carbomer (ito ang tamang INCI names hindi  Carbomer 940). Ano ba itong carbomer na ito? Itong ingredient na ito, kapag ihinalo sa tubig at inadjust ang pH sa 5-7, pinalalapot nito ang tubig at nagiging gel. Ito gel na ito ay inherently na nagbe-break kapag ito ay napadikit o nalagyan ng ions. And since sagana ang ating balat sa ions (mula sa pawis, at naiiwan sa balat kahit natuyuan na ng pawis), expected talaga na magbe-break yung gel at magtutubig. \n\nNabanggit ko na din lamang na kailangang i-adjust ang pH ng tubig na may carbomer para lumapot, bakit kaya hindi nakalista sa ingredient list yung mga neutralizing agents (halimbawa: sodium hydroxide, triethanolamine) na normal namang ginagamit kapag may carbomer sa formulation? Napansin  ko din ito dun sa tinted version ng sunscreen ng Hikari. \n\nIsa pang napansin ko sa magkaparehong sunscreen ng Hikari, bakit hindi nakalista yung emulsifier na ginamit? Papaanong nabuo itong gel cream na ito kung walang emulsifier? Kasi kung walang emulsifier sa mga sunscreen na binanggit ko, hindi mabubuo at maghihiwalay lang yung water at oil phase ng mga unscreen na yan. Baka naman meron, pero di lang inilista? Kung meron man, dapat nakadeklara yan, alinsunod sa Cosmetic Labelling Requirements ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. This applies din dun sa mga nauna kong binanggit (yung nagpapapink dito sa sunscreen, at yung neutralizing agent na ginamit para sa carbomer). Paano kaya to nakalusot sa FDA? \n\nNgayon punta naman tayo sa mga product claims nito na may concern ako:\n\n* UVA/UVB SPF 50 PA++++\n* Non-comodogenic\n* Repairs sun damage\n\nItong sunscreen na ito ay gumagamit ng tatlong UV filters:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (ganito ang tamang INCI name) \n* Zinc Oxide\n* Titanium Dioxide\n\nAng Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide ay parehong UVB filters, samantalang ang Zinc Oxide naman ay UVA/UVB filter. Ang tanong ko lang, papaanong pumalo ng SPF 50 ang rating nito at may PA++++ rating pa, samantalang mas mababa pa ang concentration ng zinc oxide at titanium dioxide sa phenoxyethanol? Assuming na isinagad sa 1% yung phenoxyethanol, ibig sabihin nito, mababa pa sa 1% yung zinc oxide at titanium dioxide. Papaanong papalo yan ng SPF 50 at magkakaroon ng PA++++ sa ganyang kababang amount? Napapaisip tuloy ako kung SPF tested ba talaga to. May pinakita na bang SPF test result para sa sunscreen na ito, pati na din dun sa tinted? Kasi diba ganun ang uso sa mga local brand owner ng sunscreen, kanya kanyang lapag ng SPF test report as part of their marketing? \n\nDoon naman sa NON-COMODOGENIC, please lang, uso ang mag proof-read bago mag-approve ng packaging layout ha. Kasimple-simple e. \n\nSa claim na \"Repairs sun damage\", bawal yang claim na yan dahil ini-imply na may physiological effect (repair sun damage) ang sunscreen na yan, na dapat wala, dahil iyan ay isang cosmetic product. Yung mga claims na ganyan na may physiological effect e papasok na sa drug category, at hindi na sa cosmetics. Paano kaya nakalusot to sa FDA? \n\nFinal words:\nMula sa formulation, claims, at ingredient list, napansin ko na ang daming problema nitong product na ito (maging yung tinted version nito). Sana naman e ma-review ito ng brand owner para ma-address yung mga punto na nabanggit ko dito. \n\nSa FDA naman, wag naman sana basta-basta approve ng approve ng CPN ng mga cosmetic products ng hindi na-a-assess ng maayos. Kaya bumababa ang kumpiyansa ng mga tao sa locally produced cosmetics e.\n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. ",

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

People who love Analytical/PChem, and people who like Organics/Inorganics.\n\nIt has to do with how your brain processes information and what you're good at. Physical Chemistry is basically Quantum Mechanics (lots of math) with extra steps, so if you're good with numbers and equations, it'll come to you easy.\n\nIf you are more skilled with abstract concepts, models, visualizations, etc., Organic and Inorganic will be your bread and butter. Biochemistry also mostly falls into here as well since its mostly organic chemistry with a wider focus. If you enjoy puzzles, Organic will be something you enjoy greatly, as most of organic chemistry is building complex molocules from common blocks and understanding why certain blocks \"fit\" a certain way with others.\n\nI personally didnt mind Physical Chem and loathed Organic because I am terrible with the abstract side of Chemistry. Analytical is sort of in-between since theres a fair bit of math, but some abstract components too (think Titration, NMR, FT/IR and Raman Spec, UV/VIS spec, and such).\n\nIn terms of overall enjoyment, it really depends what you make of it. As a concept, I enjoy all aspects of the field and I enjoyed learning about them. Having to use that information on an exam? Different story.",

That block is then immersed in a heated blend of lithium chloride salt and a solvent known as dimethylacetamide. This causes the cellulose (and remaining lignin) to swell, expanding inwards to fill the lumen.\n\nIn a final step, the processed wood is left to air-dry at room temperature for 10 hours. As it does so, it uniformly shrinks inwards from all sides, but maintains its original length.\"\n\n",

    "body": "It was third year of college when I switched from living in a dorm to a place off campus.  The past year I had spent as a residential advisor to earn some spare cash,but two weeks before the start of the semester my boss was fired and a new supervisor hired.  My old boss had lost much of the documentation, including the papers that stated I had worked for the past year, and in the transition I found myself without income or living space for the coming year.  After a few unsuccessful calls, I determined none of them had a vacancy available, cursed myself for not moving off campus the year prior, and reluctantly logged into craigslist.\n\nMy college is in a city, and it is an expensive city.  The exorbitant prices at bars had already given my some first hand experience to the cost of living, but it did little to dull the shock of rent prices.  Rooms half the size of my dorm were double the cost, and a personal bathroom quickly became a luxury my wallet could not support.\n\nI spent an hour pouring over listings, checking different combinations of keywords, locations, and price ranges, before I finally found a property worth looking in to.  I stared at the page, trying to see if the landlord had forgotten to tack on an extra zero.\n\nThe description was for an entire three story house, only four hundred per month, and even included a pool in the back.  After a minute, I read the last few lines, and realized the reason why it was so cheap.\n\n*Tenant must be willing to perform regular chores around the house, including pool maintenance, lawn maintenance, and maid services.  I work night shift, so tenant must be willing to perform these actions during the day, to be completed by each night.*\n\nI smiled.  Compared to the students I had to handle as a residential advisor, a little work around the house would be a small task.  Plus my family had owned a small pool growing up and I had kept it clean throughout high school.  With a few keystrokes, I replied to the add, and by the next morning I had an email in my inbox inviting me to view the property.\n\nIt was a fifteen minute bike ride from campus, located deep in the back of a middle class neighborhood with more speedbumps than houses.  A cluster of massive oak trees stood on either side of the drive, and a concrete pathway led to the door, which was answered by a man in jeans who looked to be in his fifties.\n\n‚ÄúHello there,‚Äù Said the man, opening the door wide with a gloved hand.  His gaze lingered on me, seeming to spend time in areas it shouldn‚Äôt, as if he were seeing a human for the first time and was not sure what traits to look for.  \n\n‚ÄúHere to answer the craigslist ad,‚Äù  I said, peering past him.  The house looked clean enough from where I was standing, and behind me there was not much yard to maintain besides raking the leaves.  \n\n‚ÄúAh, yes.‚Äù  He said, ‚ÄúCome in, come in.  My name is Jefferson, but I prefer to be called Jack.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLuke,‚Äù I said, stepping inside.  The floors were wooden, and the frame of the door had been scratched and dented from years of use.  The interior looked aged, but kept in well condition.  Such well condition that I wondered why he inquired for a housekeeper.\n\nHe led me down a hallway and to the kitchen, gesturing for me to sit at the table.  He took the chair opposite me, and when he moved it seemed stiff, an odd mechanical movement that I attributed to old joints.\n\n‚ÄúBefore I go over the terms of the lease we have to go over some ground rules.  I assume you read I expect housework to be performed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs not a problem.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGood.  Second rule is that since I work night shift, I may have some visitors in the late hours of the night before you wake up.  It would be‚Ä¶‚Äù  He paused, choosing his words, ‚ÄúQuite embarrassing for my acquaintances to see that I can no longer adequately care for myself, and they may go as far as to doubt the state of my finances.  I ask that if we awaken you, that you stay in your room until morning, as to allow me to save face.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot a problem.  I‚Äôm typically a deep sleeper.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAh yes.  Good, that‚Äôs splendid.‚Äù  He said, nodding his head vigorously, then continued, ‚ÄúOne more thing.  Due to tax purposes, it would be highly beneficial if you were to have already lived here for the past two years.  I‚Äôd be willing to refund you an extra hundred and fifty dollars a month if you could back date these forms, and sign as if you actually have been living here for some time.  I would prefer not to be caught by the IRS though, so do you know if others have documentation stating you have lived elsewhere?‚Äù\n\nTypically, I would choose to follow the law, but a hundred and fifty dollars extra a month meant my diet of ramen could be expanded into subsistence not resembling processed cardboard.  Additionally, this put a positive spin on my boss having lost my records.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm in.  Where do I have to sign?‚Äù\n\nHe pulled a stack of papers, previously prepared, and I signed and dated each.  Two weeks later I added a few scrapes to those present on the door frame when I moved my furniture inside, and placed two hundred and fifty dollars in assorted bills into Jack‚Äôs gloved hand.\n\nThat afternoon, he showed me how to maintain the pool, and I learned of the significance of the gloves.\n\n‚ÄúThis pool was build by my father for my mother back in the sixties.  She loved it very much, and I do say I have more memories of her in the pool than out of it.  It‚Äôs sentimental, and as so I want it kept in prime condition.  The size of my father‚Äôs heart starkly contrasts his skills in construction, so the levels of chemicals have to be kept quite stable.  They are controlled by this box,‚Äù  He gestured to an aluminum box with a pipe that led into the ground, ‚ÄúAnd must be manually filled daily.‚Äù \n\nHe then showed me where to dump powder into slots in the box, then showed me a sign off list where I should note the levels of powder available in storage.  The lids would have to be closed tight, or they would attract moisture from the air and become useless.  It was unlike any setup I had ever seen, archaic in its design, but seemed simple enough.  \n\n‚ÄúUnfortunately, I have a condition where I cannot handle these chemicals, and the slightest change in PH affects my skin.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve noticed my gloves, and that is why I keep them on, as my skin will crack otherwise.‚Äù\n\nWe retreated back into the house, and he gave me instructions on the other household chores, before leaving me to unpack my belongings.  I explored the house sometimes while he was gone, including the extensive basement where I washed my clothes with a small exercise rack in the corner.  There was a portrait on the wall of Jack with his mother and father, both deceased.  His father resembled Jack, and his mother looked plain and dressed plain, besides a golden necklace that ended in a heart at her throat.\n\nNext to the exercise rack there was an open doorway that led down into a single roomed second basement, with moist floors and no working light bulbs.  An enormous atlas spanned an entire wall, but besides the map the room was empty besides a small buzzing.  I never spent more that five minutes in the atlas room.  It was too desolate.  Too dark, accompanied by a feeling that I simply did not belong.\n\nThe school semester then started, and I saw little of Jack as the days turned to weeks.\n\nBut as little that I saw him, the eccentricities of his lifestyle appeared everywhere.\n\nFirst there was the cleaning.  Unlike normal housework, jack had me scrub the walls, wipe down tables, and even dust individual objects several times over when there was no residue.  He claimed this was due to a severe allergy to dust mites, but never had I seen him exhibit these symptoms.  Twice I forgot to refill the pool chemicals, and each time the pool changed from clear to a dark murk in the span of hours, and I changed the chemicals before Jack could notice.\n\nThen there were the visitors.  Nearly always I could hear the voice of a woman, or women,  her voice tinkling down the hallway.  I never saw her, but I cleaned up after them in the morning, moving cups to the sink and capping the expensive expensive bottle that was Jack‚Äôs favorite drink.  Sometimes I‚Äôd see undergarments, and I would move these to the door of Jack‚Äôs bedroom, where he would remove them by the next morning.\n\nOnce I joked about how much more often he had female companions than I, but he cracked an odd smile, and said in a low voice, ‚ÄúOne day, Luke, I‚Äôll teach you to have women swimming all around you.‚Äù\n\nBut these were mere oddities, strange doings that were Jack‚Äôs business and not mine, until one night.  One night that I will never forget, that sends chills up my spine to this day, and causes me to double check the functionality of my dead bolt.\n\nTat night I was awakened by a tornado siren at one in the morning, a howling that matched the sound of the wind as it buffeted the sides of the house.  I stayed in bed, trying to outlast the siren, but my window shattered in a sharp gust and sprayed me with a mixture of water and glass.\n\nI shouted in surprise, then threw off my blankets and headed to the basement, where it would be safest in the storm.  Jack did not usually arrive home until at least three, and the storm should blow over by then. I shivered as I ran down the steps, and sat on the work out equipment near the atlas room.  Above me, rain sploshed against a high window, and after a few minutes I moved down the steps into the atlas room for fear this window would break.  \n\nMy eyes adjusted to the atlas room, and for the first time I noticed just how old the atlas was.  Itself must have been from the sixties, and countries that no longer existed as well as borders that had long fallen crossed it‚Äôs surface.  In one corner, the atlas was damp where a leak had sprouted in the wall, and I tried to smooth it out with the palm of my hand.  But as careful as I was, the corner ripped away from the pin that held it in place, and the side of the atlas fell away from the concrete wall.\n\nBehind the atlas, there was nothing darkness and a buzzing that had grown slightly louder.\n\nMy hand reached inside, and found a light switch, which revealed the source of the buzzing.\n\nOff to the right, near the wall, there was a pool pump with piping.  Above it there was a chute leading from the ceiling, where I recognized the remnants of some of the pool cleaning powder I had been using the past few weeks.\n\nThe pool and the chute led to a glass tank, larger than any aquarium I had ever seen. The water was eye level, and the same color as the murk that had filled the pool when I forgot to add powder.  The murk was dark but transparent, and at the bottom I could baarely see several oblong objects.\n\nI stepped over the atlas and into the room.  Next to me, there was a desk, along with several pictures.  With trembling hands, I lifted one, and recognized my own face.\n\nNext to the pictures there were ten cups, each dusted to reveal fingerprints.  A sharpie circled the clearest prints of each finger, and I recognized them as my own.  Beside the cups there was a tuft of hair, the same color and length as mine.  \n\nAnd behind the desk, there was a pile of clothes taller than two months worth of laundry.  They were all women‚Äôs clothing, containing skirts and dresses, and I swallowed as I saw several undergarment pieces I had cleaned up and left for Jack.  \n\nI turned back to the tank, and squatted to see the bottom. My stomach clenched when I recognized the oblong objects.\n\nThey were bones.  Hundreds of bones, some worn away more than others, and getting smaller as they neared them bottom.  In a corner of the tank, I saw something glinting in the light of the single light bulb overhead, and recognized a golden heart among the remains.\n\nMy feet moved without any further prompt, and I ran, ripping the atlas in half.  Out through the basement door, weaving through the trees, and knowing that the tornado was far less danger than the one I left behind.\n\nWhen I recounted my story to the police three hours later, after spending the worst of the storm under a bridge near the highway, they launched an immediate investigation.  They arrived to an open door and a woman asleep on the couch.  Jack was nowhere to be found, but his footprints led down to the atlas room.\n\nAfter examination, they determined that the woman had been drugged from a chemical in Jack‚Äôs whiskey bottle.\n\nEven after searching for hours, they could find none of his fingerprints.  The house had been scrubbed too carefully for that, and I had done the cleaning.  The only ones they could find were mine.\n\nStrands of my hair were found in the pile of women‚Äôs clothing, as well as on the couch where they found the sleeping woman, and throughout Jack‚Äôs room.\n\nThe oldest bones they could find still intact were from two years ago, and they identified the powder as a powerful cleaning agent, sodium hydroxide, that had dissolved the bodies.  When checking records, the police found the owner of the house had died some years before, and was registered as Jack‚Äôs father.  No one had been living in it since then, except myself, and the records showed I had been living there for two years, as old as the oldest bone.  My own handwriting detailed the daily use of the powder in storage by the pool, as Jack had instructed.\n\nHad it not been for the testimony of the woman when she awakened, the police would have arrested me then, for the evidence against me.\n\n***\nBy Leo [Mailing List](http://weebly.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f9c3aa1eab88931af50168685&id=98f6142ea5)",

Have fun guys and gals!\n\n-----\n\nVeera slowly lost track of time as she focused on Winters‚Äô breathing.  She was vaguely aware of a steady loss of ambient light, but it was of little consequence to her.  There was nowhere she‚Äôd rather be, nowhere more important.  The two‚Ä¶or was it three‚Ä¶of them remained silent and the moments simply drifted by.  Veera closed her eyes and allowed the barest of smiles to grace her lips as she felt the human‚Äôs breathing steady out.  He had long since run out of tears, so Veera remained to provide comfort as he re-discovered his center and to remind him that he was not alone.  After a time she began to feel pins and needles along her calves, but paid it no mind.  Her top half was quite comfortable, draped across cool armor and warm skin.  When Winters finally stirred beneath her she withdrew her arms, but remained at his side.  She smiled as he looked at her.\n\n‚ÄúVeera‚Ä¶‚Äù  His voice was dry and strained.  His eyes retained a slightly bloodshot look, but they were at least dry.  ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù  \n\n‚ÄúShhh.  Yes I did.‚Äù  She insisted, bringing a finger to his lips as he made to protest.  ‚ÄúBefore you get all noble on me, remember what I told you.  It‚Äôs improper for males to touch females, not the other way around.  I couldn‚Äôt let you go through this alone.  And for the record I enjoyed that little ear scratching incident this morning, so don‚Äôt you dare apologize. ‚Äù  Her tone was gentle, but firm.  Too tired to fight, he simply nodded.  She had felt soft and warm.  He already missed it.  \n\n‚ÄúThank you then.‚Äù  He looked around the room but said nothing more.  He still seemed lost, adrift as he acknowledged the memories of that harrowing day in detail for the first time.\n\n‚ÄúShall we have another bite to eat?‚Äù  Veera suggested, rising to her feet and stretching.  She winced as the blood rushed back through her legs.  Looking up, she saw a dark sky without light through the vent in her roof.  Winters nodded to her.  ‚ÄúWould you tend to the fire then, please?‚Äù  She requested, thinking assigning him a task might help.  With another nod, he began arranging a few pieces of wood around the pit and the dying embers.  The remains of the stew were soon hot.  After Veera distributed the spoons, the two ate their meal in silence.  While she was certainly happy to see Winters come out of his torpor and engage in the necessary actions to keep his body alive, she wasn‚Äôt sure what to do next.  Surely there were no more secrets to pry for, at least none immediately relevant to their situation.  And she certainly didn‚Äôt want to press that issue further.  She knew everything, thanks to Io, and she knew that Winters knew.  Looking over at him, she felt a peace settle within her.  *When he‚Äôs ready, I know he‚Äôll talk to me.*  As if reading her thoughts, Winters caught her eye and after a moment gave her a brief nod.  When they concluded their meal, Winters stood.\n\n‚ÄúWould you like to stay here tonight?‚Äù  Veera asked.  Knowing what that offer sounded like, she elaborated.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine on the floor for a night.  I know you don‚Äôt have a bed in that pod.‚Äù  He simply looked at her for a long moment, something shining behind his eyes, before shaking his head.\n\n‚ÄúNo, but thank you Veera.  You‚Äôve already done enough tonight.‚Äù  Winters told her as he gathered his helmet.  She walked past the fire to stand before him.  \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre leaving then?‚Äù  She asked softly, placing a hand on his chest.  With a pained grin, he brought his own up to cover it, nestling it in place against his heart. \n\n‚ÄúI am.  I know it may not seem like it now, but I will get better Veera.  That‚Äôs in part thanks to you.  I need some time alone tonight, and maybe tomorrow as well.  This was‚Ä¶even harder than I thought it might be.  I miss them all very much.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring you some food tomorrow.‚Äù  She offered.  ‚ÄúNo sense in you coming all the way back here.‚Äù  She wanted to say something about his comrades, something to provide him a last measure of comfort before he left, but felt uneasy speaking of the dead.\n\n‚ÄúThat would be great, thanks.‚Äù  He released Veera and stepped back, pausing as he raised the leather flap covering her door.  ‚ÄúCould you do me a favor Veera?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOf course, what is it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you see Thantis, can you tell him that I appreciate his guidance and that he was right?‚Äù  Veera nodded in fierce affirmation, elated that Winters might be finding a place in her world.\n\n‚ÄúI will.  I‚Äôll seek him out first thing tomorrow.‚Äù  She promised.\n\n‚ÄúThank you Veera.  And truly, after tonight, you don‚Äôt owe me a thing.  Selah, my friend.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSelah‚Ä¶my friend.‚Äù  Veera bid him farewell with a tearful whisper, feeling the weight in her chest grow hotter as a rush of emotion flowed through her veins.  To hear those words from his mouth after everything that had just happened meant something she couldn‚Äôt quite put into words.  *My friend‚Ä¶*\n\n-----\n\n‚ÄúI owe you thanks as well Io.‚Äù  Winters told the VI as they entered the forest.  The sound of rain pattering against his helmet faded as they gained cover.  ‚ÄúIo?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôm here sir.‚Äô  A small voice called to him and the image of Io‚Äôs ‚Äòface‚Äô appeared on his HUD.  She wasn‚Äôt looking him in the eye.  ‚ÄòIs this‚Ä¶is this what sorrow feels like?‚Äô  She asked him.\n\n‚ÄúIt might be.  What do you feel?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòEmptiness and a‚Ä¶tightness almost?  It‚Äôs worst when I think about you there, at the end, when the Captain spoke.  My subroutines were at war with one another.  I hurt you.‚Äô  Io cried.\n\n‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt you that hurt me Io.‚Äù  Winters tried to reassure her, feeling hollow himself.  ‚ÄúThe truth is that one day this had to happen.  One day, I would have to acknowledge that Jess died aboard the Lancer and that recording was our last conversation, the last time I would see her.‚Äù  He took in a shuddering breath and looked up at the black canopy of leaves and starless sky.  ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt ready for that.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòThen why thank me sir?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúBecause sometimes you need to do things you aren‚Äôt ready for.  Sometimes you find yourself in a hole that you just can‚Äôt find a way out of.  Without you I‚Äôd still be down there at the bottom.  Right now I feel like I‚Äôve begun to climb.  I‚Äôm very lucky to have you as a partner.‚Äù  He glanced over at Io as her projection vanished.\n\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want you to see me cry sir, but I am happy that I was able to help you.  Tonight has been difficult on all of us I think, even your scrawny girl.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúEven Veera?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòOf course sir.  We know that Veera has also suffered the loss of family, in her case a biological one.  I am sure tonight brought back some of those memories for her, though I cannot be certain.  Beyond that‚Ä¶I do think she‚Äôs formed an attachment to you.  I am sure it is nice for Veera to meet someone who looks at her and sees only her, as opposed to her mother‚Äôs stripes or her poverty.  To see someone you care about grieve cannot be an easy task.  I believe it was beneficial that we addressed the memory of the Captain in her presence.‚Äô  Io left out the plea she‚Äôd made to the young Cauthan.  \n\n‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶you just called her Veera.‚Äù  Winters remarked with disbelief.\n\n‚ÄòYou see sir?  Tonight has been trying on all of us.‚Äô  Io sighed\n\n‚ÄúIt has.  Thank you for sticking with me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòI would not rather be anywhere else sir.‚Äô\n\nBy the time Winters returned to his pod, both he and Io were more than ready to embrace the respite of sleep.  Their quest to survive would beckon anew in the morning.\n\n-----\n\n‚ÄúAh, my child, please enter.  Be welcome in the presence of Kel.‚Äù  Thantis greeted Veera the next morning, surprised to see her at such an hour.  She was no stranger, given her visitations to her father‚Äôs shrine, but dropping by at dawn was unusual.\n\n‚ÄúThank you Thantis.‚Äù  She gave the elderly Cauthan a slight bow.  He had always been kind to her, doing what he could to ease the passing of her parents.  In the time since, she would often stop by for tea or light conversation, primarily in the winter months when the days were short and there was nothing to do but remain warm and hope her food didn‚Äôt run out.  ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù  She asked.\n\n‚ÄúI must admit it is a bit more difficult getting out of bed these days, but my joints have served me well for a very long time.  I do not mind.  Tea helps.  What brings you here so early young one?  Have you need of my assistance?‚Äù  He asked kindly.\n\n‚ÄúNo Thantis, today I‚Äôm here as a messenger.‚Äù  She smiled at him\n\n‚ÄúOh, that is most interesting.  A messenger on whose behalf?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe human, Winters.‚Äù  She remembered Russell‚Äôs conversation with Antoth, how he‚Äôd said only his friends could use his first name.  She was unsure where Thantis stood in that regard, and so she stuck with his surname.  ‚ÄúHe wanted to thank you.  He said your guidance was of help to him, and that you were correct.‚Äù  A genuine smile lit the old one‚Äôs face as he understood Veera‚Äôs meaning.  He nodded to her.\n\n‚ÄúI am happy to hear it.  Thank you for delivering this message.  He is a polite young man I must say, indulged me in the most interesting conversation the other day.  Did you know that certain humans used to preserve their dead in tombs made of stone?!‚Äù  He asked animatedly.  Veera could not help but giggle at his enthusiasm at such a macabre topic.  \n\n‚ÄúI did not Thantis.  Perhaps some other time you can tell me of it.  But now I must be going, the fields won‚Äôt water themselves you know.‚Äù  \n\n‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôll not be wanting to stay for tea.  Very well dear, off you go then.  Thank you for the message and say hello to Winters for me.‚Äù  He bid her farewell.\n\n‚ÄúI shall.  And uh‚Ä¶Thantis‚Ä¶‚Äù  Veera paused at the entryway.\n\n‚ÄúYes child?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat guidance did you give to Winters exactly?‚Äù  She knew such matters were private, but her curiosity would not be denied.  Thantis didn‚Äôt seem to mind though as a twinkle graced his eye.\n\n‚ÄúI merely told him the truth.‚Äù  He replied cryptically.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what might that be?‚Äù  \n\n‚ÄúThat you would listen.‚Äù  Thantis said with importance.  ‚ÄúI am glad that he found someone to confide in.  The burden of loss is always heavy, but never moreso than when one is alone.  He did not share his tale with me and I will not ask.  Just know that either of you can come to see me should the weight become too much.  To take the first step is often the hardest.  It is good you were there with him.‚Äù  He smiled warmly at her.  ‚ÄúNow go child, I am sure we will speak again soon.‚Äù  \n\nVeera nodded in departure and began the long walk to her field, wondering how Thantis had become so good at reading situations like this one.  She felt that increasingly familiar warmth radiating from her chest, from the place that she had stored Russell‚Äôs secret.  *He chose me, chose to share the story with me and me alone.*  Veera hugged herself tightly in happiness and resolved to be patient, to temper her innate curiosity.  She knew that Winters would have to process things at his own pace, and that the task of survival would likely get in the way.  The harvest would be soon, a couple weeks from now if she measured by Winters‚Äô convention.  That would be her mission now.  With a smile, she thought of all they could do with a full harvest of dato supplemented by meat or fish.  Her stomach rumbled, not from hunger, but anticipation.  She brought her fingers to her lips and let out a delighted peal of laughter.  It had been ages since she‚Äôd faced a long day of work with such purpose.  She fingered the smooth metal of Winters‚Äô‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶her canteen as it rested at the bottom of her satchel.  *We do make a pretty good team‚Ä¶*\n\n-----\n\nWithout the rapping of soft fur on metal, Winters awoke instead to Io‚Äôs alarm.  With a grunt, he kicked the door of the pod away much harder than necessary.  \n\n‚ÄòQuite the performance sir.‚Äô  Io supplied.  ‚ÄòHow are you feeling?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúLike hell, but at least now it‚Äôs something along the lines of anger, instead of whatever last night was.‚Äù  He trailed off as he remembered the salt of tears and the comfort of fur around the back of his neck.  ‚ÄúHonestly Io, I‚Äôm an emotional wreck right now.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòI understand sir.  Shall we begin with the next project?‚Äô  She asked.\n\n‚ÄúNo, not yet.  We have a few more pieces to go and I wouldn‚Äôt want to disturb Veera.  And before you say something snarky about the ‚Äòscrawny girl‚Äô, no, I‚Äôm not ready to face her yet either.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòThen what shall we do sir?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve no intention of idling around.  We need to design some clothing.‚Äù  A vast array of models and fabrics began playing across his HUD, with material needs, warmth rating, flexibility and other statistics listed beneath.  Io appeared with a satisfied grin as she curled a finger around her dangling lock of hair.\n\n‚ÄòNext task please.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt let me finish Io.‚Äù  The VI gave him a look of displeasure.\n\n‚ÄòWhat else did you have in mind sir?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúYou.  Even if I leave my armor behind you‚Äôre far too valuable.  I need to make something that will allow you to come along with me.‚Äù  Her expression immediately brightened before she winked out of view.\n\n‚ÄòAnalyzing possible solutions sir.  Why don‚Äôt you freshen yourself up and we will reconvene afterward?‚Äô  Io asked, hoping to encourage her partner to maintain his routines.\n\n‚ÄúRight.  Be back in a minute.‚Äù\n\nWhen Winters returned he grabbed his helmet and sat atop the pod.  He‚Äôd not been there in a couple days and missed the small but noticeable change in perspective.  Turning himself to the west so as not to be distracted by a certain fuzzy someone going about her business in the distance, he ran through a couple of the designs Io had come up with.\n\n‚ÄòThey all revolve around the auxiliary computing hardware you had installed in your suit sir.  That decision turned out to be exceptionally provident.‚Äô  Io began.  Winters let himself think back to how Jess had supported his ‚Äòunorthodox‚Äô loadout before he proved it successful in the simulators.  He shook his head and refocused on the HUD.  ‚ÄòAny pants will need to be capable of supporting the hardware currently in your armor as well as an external power source.  It will be possible to connect the two like so.‚Äô  Io highlighted thin wiring moving from one leg of his hypothetical lower garment up to the waistline and down again.  ‚ÄòThe battery that will give us the most equivalent weight distribution is capable of supplying three Maran days of power.  We will be able to use wiring already available to us.  Should you prefer a slimmer design I believe we can recycle the metal of the main thrusters, though that process would consume two day‚Äôs worth of solar draw at peak efficiency.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt we think of this when we were talking about repairing the long distance communications array?‚Äù  Winters could have slapped himself.\n\n‚ÄòDifferent metal sir, though I would certainly keep those around.  If we need to forge weapons or armor it would be of great use to us.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúNo arguments there Io.  What‚Äôs our reserve power status?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòTopped off sir.  Spending time in the abode of the scrawny one has proven advantageous from a conservation perspective.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúWell alright then.  I guess we can live a little, right?  We‚Äôll go with the streamlined wiring.  I like the idea of cargo pants.‚Äù  Winters remembered his mother throwing away his favorite pair of baggy pants when he was fifteen.  *Oh mom if you could see me now.*  A genuine smile took form on his face as he looked up at the star of the system, accented by a few fluffy clouds.  ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt go wrong with more pockets right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòIn a place like this, I would think not sir.  Though you get no points for fashion.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúThat, I can live with.  Io, can you make sure the waist can hold a holster for both a pistol and knife as well as my canteen?‚Äù  He pointed with his eyes at where he envisioned the gear might rest on his belt line.  Io seamlessly added in a reinforcement of weave and stitching.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the material here Io?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòRayon sir.  The compound consists entirely of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, though older refining processes required various other chemical reagents such as carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúWhat is it refined from?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòCellulose sir, plant fibers.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúBooyah.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòTo think you‚Äôd be so excited about clothing‚Ä¶‚Äô  Io replied with just a hint of sass.  ‚ÄòThough I suppose the microweave structure is quite inventive.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúElaborate?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòDesigned correctly, clothing made of this material can generate heat in the process of wicking moisture from the body.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúDouble booyah.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòYou‚Äôre incorrigible sir, but I am glad that you‚Äôre feeling a bit better.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúNo reason not to be excited if the situation calls for it, even if I could barely sleep last night.‚Äù  He made to rub his eyes before he remembered he had his helmet on.  Rectifying the situation, he asked Io to continue with her ideas.\n\n‚ÄòFor your upper body I believe it would be useful to employ a multi-layered approach.  This way we can achieve an outer layer of Kevlar over a base layer of rayon, like so.‚Äô  A new set of images crowded his field of view, showing a skin tight rayon garment with a few basic sensors as well as the necessary connections for his helmet‚Äôs detachable visor.  \n\n‚ÄúI was wondering if I‚Äôd ever get a chance to use this thing.  Was never really in a situation before when I needed the HUD but could remove my helmet.  Well, first time for everything right?  I like what I‚Äôm seeing.  What about the outer layer?‚Äù  A second prototype hovered before him, a snug fitting vest with pockets for just about everything.  Winters noticed a sheath for a secondary knife, a place to store extra pistol or rifle magazines, watertight pockets for food, a clip for his shield and even a built in quiver that would rest diagonally across his back.  ‚ÄúDamn Io, that‚Äôs looking mighty fine.  I appreciate the work.  We can do this with what we have?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòYes sir.  The Kevlar will require some nitrogen in addition to the usual, but even if we cannot reclaim any from the grasses surrounding the pod there is plenty in the atmosphere.  Additionally, the power draw for these items will be smaller than refining the metal of the main thrusters.  If we do not wish to dip below five days of reserves, the entire process will take two days assuming weather like this holds.  I would recommend two pairs each of the pants and the under layer, as well as one vest.  Anything else while I‚Äôm queueing up these items?‚Äô  She asked professionally.  Winters blew out a long breath.  Io cottoned on immediately.  ‚ÄòSomething for your scrawny girl, perhaps?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that I should‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòHer dress is falling apart sir.  We can spare the power.  You already gifted her your canteen, so there‚Äôs plenty of precedent.  Besides, it would cause quite the stir in the village, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äô  Io seemed to get a kick out of the idea.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know where to begin; something capable of carrying a four inch blade in its sheath as well as a canteen at least?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòLooks like it was a good thing I took all her measurements then.‚Äô  Io said with satisfaction.  ‚ÄòHow does this look sir?‚Äô  She showed him a simple dress with sleeves, made of a coarser fiber, more like wool, that had multiple loops at the waist for the necessary accessories.  Winters nodded at her.  ‚ÄòI believe this would be appropriate.‚Äô  She brought up a color palette and highlighted black and a dusky gold to match Veera‚Äôs coat.  The collar, cuffs, and hem were off white.  Winters was content to let Io have her fun until she began drawing in gold on the black background.\n\n‚ÄúIo what are you‚Ä¶‚Äù  His eyes went large as the pattern clicked.  On the left side of the dress a perfect replica of the triangular fractals on his armor came to life.  On the right shoulder was a HEL Omega branch insignia.  ‚ÄúAre you serious Io?!  Is that even allowed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòWe are a team Russell.‚Äô  Io insisted, applying a white and blue coloration to his shirts and vest.  The pants were a dark grey.  ‚ÄòYou should always remember who you are and why you‚Äôre here.‚Äô  She told him, applying the Omega patch to his gear.  ‚ÄòIf she is to be with us, I think it‚Äôs only proper.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶will definitely cause a scene.‚Äù  Winters smirked, wondering how the less agreeable villagers would take to the idea of the town ‚Äòmutt‚Äô walking around with well-made clothes bearing an insignia of the human military.  The thought excited him; not quite like jumping out of a ship did, but close enough.  It tapped into that common desire that all HEL Jumpers possessed, the desire to cause at least a modicum of havoc wherever they went.  ‚ÄúI like it Io, please queue it all up.  Feel free to extend the manufacturing time to minimize power draw.  One last item to address I‚Äôm thinking.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòWhat would that be sir?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúWinter gear, a coat at a minimum.‚Äù  A large block of text displayed on the screen.  Winters squinted to read it all.  ‚ÄúOperation put that snarky bitch Ratha in her place‚Ä¶‚Äù  He stared at Io off to his right, she stared right back, a look of complete and utter seriousness on her face.\n\n‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúI appreciate the sentiment.  What does it entail though?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòBeating her at her own game.  While I would never suggest an ursae hunt, I have identified a suitable target that would not only allow for the construction of warm outer clothing but would also convey a certain amount of status.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúWell you had my curiosity Io, now you have my attention.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòExcellent sir.‚Äô  She flipped her head slightly, accentuating her digitally perfect features.  ‚ÄòIf you recall, Ratha mentioned another predatory species, the hyrven.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúI do, but how do you know what they are?‚Äù  Winters asked, picking his brain for any possible mention of the animal.  He came up blank.\n\n‚ÄòYou never ordered me to stop compilation of the Cauthan translation program.  As such I have been actively recording and processing all ambient conversation in public that is within range.  While I do not know what exactly the animal looks like, I do know that they are pack hunters that likely share territory with the ursae, especially in the north and west.  Their fur is regarded as something of a luxury, as you can see here.‚Äô  Io showed him a few images, one of Antoth, one of Ratha, and one of Vash.  All of them bore at least some ornamentation consisting of a snowy grey fur.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, now that I think about it, you‚Äôre right.  I‚Äôve only seen that fur in a few places.  Most of them are wearing the brown stuff, or leather.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòIndeed sir, I believe the brown fur is from the chesko.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúBad fur.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòRatha did say as much.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm inclined to believe her on that point.  Very well, so you‚Äôre saying we should hunt down a few hyrven and make a cloak or two?  I like it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòExactly sir.  Oh I can‚Äôt wait to see Ratha‚Äôs face when we show up dragging a few of those beasts by the tail, to say nothing of your scrawny girl walking around with such a cloak.‚Äô  Her projection now sported a feral grin that Winters was sure would even give his commanding officers pause.  He mirrored it.\n\n‚ÄúI really like where you‚Äôre going with this Io.  Once we‚Äôre set with irrigation and the other clothing we‚Äôll revisit this plan.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòAbsolutely sir.  Ah, is it lunch time already?‚Äô  She noted idly.  Winters looked over his shoulder to see Veera approaching the pod.  She was walking without hurry, but looked up at him with a worried expression.  The night before came crashing back and slammed into the front of his skull.  He brought a hand to his head and breathed in heavily.\n\n‚ÄúI guess I can‚Äôt hide forever, can I?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòNo sir.‚Äô\n\n-----\n\n[p]: https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/81l7jp/oc_the_hel_jumper_chapter_18/\n[f]: https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7oulr8/oc_the_hel_jumper_chapter_1/\n\n[Previous] [p] | [First] [f] | [Next] [n]\n\n-----\n\nOwn The HEL Jumper in the Format of your Choice: [hardcover] (http://www.lulu.com/shop/sabatonbabylon/the-hel-jumper-survive/hardcover/product-23914997.html) | [paperback] (http://www.lulu.com/shop/sabatonbabylon/the-hel-jumper-survive/paperback/product-23916511.html) | [epub] (http://www.lulu.com/shop/sabatonbabylon/the-hel-jumper-survive/ebook/product-23909951.html) | [Amazon Kindle] (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M5HJ4YP?pf_rd_p=c2945051-950f-485c-b4df-15aac5223b10&pf_rd_r=1QRG8X6MYTE9EZP9BYC7)",

According to the sheriff, the hacker spent up to five minutes in the system and adjusted the amount of sodium hydroxide in the water from 100 parts per million to 11,100.\n\n‚ÄúThis is obviously a significant and potentially dangerous increase. Sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, is the main ingredient in liquid drain cleaners,\" Gualtieri added.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: As \\\\u\\\\[uzupocky](https://www.reddit.com/user/uzupocky) pointed out.

Can also use Lye, as main ingredient you need is Sodium Hydroxide. Just be careful and wear gloves. The product was left on for about 40 minutes total, and I reapplied once half way through. After rinsing everything at the end, I got an acidwash effect. If you want to completely remove the anodizing, leaving everything on for an extra hour or so would.probanly so the trick. Just be careful leaving it on too long as you can \"burn\" the metal if you leave product on for too long. \n\nWith some bare metal now exposed, using a satin clear coat would be my recommendation. I kinda like how this project turned out, but maybe that's just me :).",

        "body": "Oven cleaner is just lye. Lye dissolves aluminum. Anodizing is pretty simple, you take aluminum, put it in a chemical bath, and use electricity to purposely grow a layer of aluminum oxide (aluminum rust) that is thick and porous, like a sponge. Then you dip it in a dye bath, which traps pigments in the oxide layer, then seal it. There are several different types of anodizing but that's the basics.\n\nLye dissolves aluminum oxide, which takes with it the dye used to color. But it will dissolve aluminum even FASTER than the oxide coating.\n\nIf it gets through a section with slightly thinner anodizing than another area, the lye starts attacking the aluminum, but you won't be able to tell, because other areas might still have anodizing, and you will be left with pock marks / craters, into the aluminum. It's a surface area thing, once you get a crater, it has more surface area than smooth flat metal, which means it reacts faster, increasing the size of the pit and it's surface area, which causes the reaction to go faster.. \n\n\nAnd then you're left with deep craters or even holes, while other areas still have some black (or whatever) anodizing that hasn't fully dissolved yet. Which is visible in the pictures above, extremely deep craters.\n\nI would strongly recommend anyone who tries this to either stop the removal before you get all the anodizing off, and finish up with a wire wheel, or sandpaper, or whatever. If you want the 'attacked by chemicals' look, once you've cleaned it down to bare aluminum, you can put more degreaser on, for just a handful of minutes, to get the look you want, with no chance of deep pitting.",

I'm just guessing since I have no idea what crazy new age magic they put in that device. Ultra pure water won't read back an accurate pH. There's not sufficient dissolved ions in the water to react quickly with the test strip. You can add a neutral salt such as KCl to get around this. Due to the fact that pH can not be accurately measured, it is meaningless with regard to purified water. Kangen, as we all suspect, are talking TOTAL horseshit. Source: I'm an analytical chemist.",

It takes out the nasty particulates in the water. You can search the quality of the tap water in your area by searching ‚ÄúEWG Tap Water Database‚Äù and inputting your zip code - you‚Äôll probably be disgusted so you‚Äôre warns. Reverse osmosis filters are the real deal BUT you can get very high quality ones for about 1/10th the price of Kangen. Mine personally cost $500. It does work, has been tested by 3rd parties and confirmed to remove almost all cancer causing particulates, as well as my own testing with strips to confirm a reduction in PPM. It significantly reduced the PPM in my water and it tastes noticeably better now, even better than what a Brita does. In this case the goal is no taste and Brita does leave more taste behind than a reverse osmosis filter which gets it to almost no taste.\n\nThat said reverse osmosis filters are indiscriminate, they don‚Äôt only remove the bad particulates in the water but good ones to. So if you use a reverse osmosis filter it‚Äôs important to re-add the good minerals which there are tons of packets for. I personally use sea water packets which repopulate the water with sodium and 84 other valuable minerals. Also the difference between a reverse osmosis filter and something like a charcoal filter is night and day in terms of the actual water quality you get. A standard charcoal filter is not going to remove many, if any, of the cancer causing particulates like a reverse osmosis filter will.\n\nIn case you didn‚Äôt catch on, I am obsessed with water quality.",

    "body": "MY NEW VERSION OF THIS PROCESS IS LOCATED HERE: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/avme9u/how_to_make_salt_and_vinegar_seasoning_updated/\n\nI am a huge fan of salt and vinegar chips. It has been my favorite go to snack every sense I was a kid. But yet I always wondered how the seasoning was made so when I dug down and did a little research I found out how industry produces the seasoning and modified the process to replicate at home. This seasoning produced in this recipe is very vinegary and worth the time involved making it!\n\nBefore we get started I just want to make clear that this process is still experimental and I am still playing around with it. Once I figure out a better way of producing it I will post it. \n\nSo to start we all know the main chemical used as the flavoring agent in Salt and Vinegar seasoning is Sodium Diacetate and industrially it is made by combing Sodium Hydroxide (Lye) with Glacial Acetic Acid (99% Pure Vinegar) to form Sodium Acetate. Then more Glacial Acidic acid is added to lock in the acidic flavor and convert the chemical over to Sodium Diacetate.\n\nBut for my process we will be using Vinegar instead of Glacial Acetic Acid, Baking Soda instead of Lye, and Citric Acid in replacement of the acetic acid. The addition of the citric acid will be explained later in the recipe.\n\nThis home version (in theory) produces Sodium Diacetate along with a small amount of Sodium Citrate without using dangerous industrial chemicals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW MAKE SALT AND VINEGAR SEASONING**\n\n1. Add **2.4L** of White Distilled Vinegar to a large pot.\n2. Add **100g** of Baking Soda to the vinegar **IN SMALL AMOUNTS!** After the solution has finished bubbling, heat the solution to 160F for 1 hour to ensure the reaction has completed.\n3. Evaporate the solution by boiling it down to about **1/10** of its original volume (or more) until you see crystals start to form at the top of the liquid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *During the evaporation process you will begin to see crystals forming on the side of the pot as well. Collect a small portion of these from the pot and set them aside to use as seed crystals for the crystallization process.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*4.* After boiling down the liquid transfer it to a clean beaker and cool the liquid in an ice bath. When the solution has cooled down to room temperature take a seed crystal and drop it into the solution. (You should immediately see the liquid start to crystallize).\n\n5. Transfer the newly formed Sodium Acetate crystals to some coffee filters and Allow it to dry. After drying the Sodium Acetate grind it into a fine powder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This recipe can be scaled up or down to meet requirements.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***(PART 2)*** **Making Salt and Vinegar Seasoning:**\n\n1. Add **140g** of Sodium Acetate to a beaker.\n2. Add **21g** of Sea Salt to the mixture along with **12g** of Corn Starch and combine well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The Corn Starch is added to prevent the seasoning from clumping after drying.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Next add **24-27g** of Citric Acid ***(This step converts (some) of the sodium acetate back to acetic acid)***. Stir the powders until the powder starts to clump up and becomes a wet slimy paste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The powder will clump together and become wet due to acetic acid forming thus combining with the left over unconverted sodium acetate. The powder is now comprised of both Sodium Acetate and Acetic Acid and possibly a little harmless sodium citrate. Which in theory is our desired sodium diacetate product. I have come up with this hypothesis because sodium diacetate is a combination of sodium acetate and acetic acid which is just what we have created.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Transfer the wet powder to a coffee filter and allow it to dry. Then grind the seasoning into a fine powder.\n\n5. Place the seasoning inside a clean container with a lid and store in a cool dry place and enjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This recipe can be scaled up or down to meet requirements.***",

It looks to me like you'd get a mix of mostly sodium diacetate with some sodium acetate in your initial reaction.  Adding the sea salt and corn starch aren't relevant to the reaction.  Adding the citric acid won't participate in the reaction either since the baking soda will be used up in the initial reaction.  If the citric acid were to be neutralized, you'd get sodium citrate, not another acetate.\n\nYou're spot on with the distilled vinegar though.  I've tried making sodium diacetate using baking soda and 12% industrial vinegar before.  The residual alcohols make the pre-crystalized blob brown and gave the powder an off flavor.",

The precise nature of lobsters, specifically whether they are fish, has been a contested issue in international law for more than one hundred years. There are [30 species](http://www.mesa.edu.au/crustaceans/crustaceans05b.asp) of clawed lobsters, but the most important is the *Homarus americanus* or American lobster, which is found in the Atlantic. More than half of all lobster products are produced in Canada and the United States while the top three lobster-importing countries are Japan, China, and the U.S. There are 45 species of *Panulirus spp.* or spiny lobsters and *Jasus spp.* or [rock lobsters](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/200/m200p241.pdf), which are found near the coasts of Florida, Brazil, Cuba, and Australia, and are grouped together. Australia and New Zealand are the biggest producers of spiny lobster products. *Homarus gammarus*, the [European lobster](https://www.imr.no/genimpact/filarkiv/2007/07/european_lobster.pdf/en), can be found from the Norwegian Sea to the Aegean Sea. Lobsters are not stationary: they migrate an average of 30 kilometres (19 miles) a year, though some migrate more than [900 miles](https://mlcalliance.org/all-about-lobster/lobster-101-habitat/), making lobster management and ownership difficult and contentious. Lobsters have existed for at least [120 million years](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-lobster/mexico-finds-worlds-oldest-lobster-fossil-idUSN0242811320070503) and live as long as [140](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/4213315/George-the-140-year-old-lobster-to-be-released-by-New-York-restaurant.html) years, showing little cell degradation as they age. They are also capable of [reflex amputation](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/outreach-and-education/fun-facts-about-luscious-lobsters), regrowing lost limbs.\n\n##Why lobsters are so valuable\n\nThe [global lobster market](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4775667/lobster-market-global-industry-trends-share?utm_source=BW&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_code=xs7x4l&utm_campaign=1271187+-+Global+Lobster+Market+Overview+%26+Outlook+2019-2024+-+Leading+Players+are+East+Cost+Seafood%2c+Garbo+Lobster%2c+High+Liner+Foods%2c+Escanaba%2c+and+Thai+Union&utm_exec=joca220prd) is worth ‚Ç¨6.7 billion/$5.7 billion USD (2018). Market researchers project the lobster trade will reach ‚Ç¨12.51 billion/$13.9 billion USD in value in 2024. The current value of lobsters is based almost solely as seafood, but that may change. There are [more than 200](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/) known applications for lobsters and lobster by-products. Chitin, a biopolymer derived from lobster shells, can be extracted easily and cheaply by grinding up the shells, which traditionally have been trashed. Adding sodium hydroxide to chitin produces [chitosan](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/af57/fa5a2b237174301b9b2740adbbe531a4a527.pdf), a carbohydrate with biomedical applications. The U.S. Army has used more than 400,000 [field bandages](https://www.wired.com/2007/02/shrimp-bandages-save-soldiers/) from shrimp chitosan and now a company has created [lobster-based](https://www.timesrecord.com/articles/front-page/maine-firm-creating-bandages-made-with-lobster-shells/) chitosan bandages. MIT and Harvard University researchers are turning lobster chitin into a flexible, more maneuverable, [body armor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/19/mit-scientists-are-using-lobsters-develop-new-form-flexible-body-armor/). Researchers at [McGill University](https://www.ellsworthamerican.com/maine-news/waterfront/scientists-find-better-way-to-make-use-of-lobster-shells/), the Royal College of Art, and Imperial College London have made lobster chitin into a recyclable, biodegradable [alternative](https://www.businessinsider.com/lobster-shells-plastic-biodegradable-recycle-single-use-waste-2019-5) to single use plastic products like straws and plastic bags. Researchers at the University of Havana have developed [surgical threads](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070713131300.htm) and stitches from lobsters. Lobster chitin can also act as a [surgical implant](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/12/08/researchers-find-new-way-to-convert-lobster-shells-into-durable-plastic/). [Lobster blood](https://bangordailynews.com/2017/01/20/business/lobster-blood-could-be-the-next-best-thing-to-help-treat-warts-shingles/) treats warts and shingles and other skin issues. [Chitin](https://www.joc.com/crabs-lobsters-claw-their-way-uses-medicine-and-food_19880608.html) is a food preservative. It treats itching from burn wounds. It is used in [nutraceuticals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336979/), nutritional, medicinal products, and [pharmaceuticals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/), medicinal drugs. Chitin acts as chickenfeed and can be made into [dog biscuits](https://archive.bangordailynews.com/2006/03/09/making-it-in-maine-lobster-bisque-its-let-canine-companions-enjoy-seafood/) and compost. It is used in food packaging, bio-stimulant wheat [seed coating](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070713131300.htm), sonar technology, [self-healing car paint](https://newatlas.com/self-healing-car-paint/11254/), [flu decontaminants](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/bm200970x), and [antiviral drugs](https://newatlas.com/chitin-cheaper-antiviral-drugs/21457/).\n\nHumans have eaten lobsters for thousands of years. Lobsters are typically boiled alive to prevent transmission of Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria found in lots of seafood, which spreads through lobsters within hours of their deaths. Untreated vibrio infections have a [30-50%](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/seafood-lovers-dangers-vibrio-bacteria/story?id=56688448) mortality rate. Lobsters are also difficult to transport for long periods as they tend to get sick and die or resort to cannibalism in confined spaces. Lobsters are a [high protein, low fat](https://www.seafoodworld.net/nutritional-value-of-lobsters/) food and are arguably superior to red meat. As researchers from the University of Adelaide [explain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/), \"The amino acid profile of crustacean protein such as lobster is comparable to that of red meat protein, but it contains more nonprotein nitrogen (amino acids, small peptides, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), trimethylamine, creatine, creatinine, and nucleotides) ranging from 10‚Äì40%. Thus, crustacean protein is more palatable than meat proteins.\"\n\n##Lobster conflicts\n\n###China, the U.S., and Canada\n\n####U.S. regulations\n\nAmerican lobstermen have been subjected to tremendous economic pressure, first from government regulation, then hurricanes, competition from Canada, and now the U.S.-China trade war. The North Atlantic right whale, a critically endangered species, tends to get tangled in the ropes lobstermen use in their lobster traps. The population has been in a decade-long decline, mostly dying after getting tangled or struck by boats. In [2009](https://bangordailynews.com/2009/11/15/news/lobster-fishermen-shed-floating-rope/), the U.S. government forced lobstermen to switch from floating rope to sinking rope, and 1.6 million pounds of rope had to be discarded and replaced. In 2015, the government limited trap lines and lobstermen switched to stronger lines, which [actually killed more whales](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected/whaletrp/trt/meetings/September%202018/tm247__2_.pdf). The federal government is [now](https://www.wsj.com/articles/noaas-plan-to-save-the-whales-has-maine-lobstermen-boiling-11567809249) pressuring the industry to come up with more regulations to address the issue. In 2018 and again in [2019](https://www.mainepublic.org/post/maines-lobster-industry-braces-catastrophic-cuts-bait-fish-catch), the U.S. government imposed stringent herring quotas. Lobstermen, who relied on herring as lobster bait, [switched](https://www.wbur.org/earthwhile/2019/05/28/lobster-bait-herring-shortage-fisheries) to pig hides and other species of fish from outside local areas. American lobstermen are regulated at five levels of government: local, state, federal, international, and by the [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission](http://www.asmfc.org/about-us/program-overview), an inter-state compact created by the federal government in 1942. Competitors outside the U.S. face less regulation and lax enforcement of existing rules.\n\n####Canadian competition\n\nCanada has [only recently](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/canada-boosts-protection-of-north-atlantic-right-whales) moved to protect the whales and has far fewer restrictions on lobster fishing. For example, Canadian lobstermen do not have a lobster maximum [size limit](https://www.savingseafood.org/news/washington/sen-susan-collins-questions-lobster-tariffs-and-grey-zone-dispute/) while American lobstermen are [limited](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/species/lobster/guide/index.html) to catching lobster's with a body shell length of five inches. The bigger the lobster shell, the more meat it has and the greater the lobster's value. In [September 2017](https://bangordailynews.com/2019/08/26/news/hancock/its-lost-much-of-its-overseas-business-but-a-lobster-firm-is-starting-up-in-bucksport/), the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement went into affect, eliminating 98% of EU tariffs on Canadian goods. It allowed Canada to export lobsters to the EU, replacing American lobster exports. That same month Florida lobstermen [lost 100,000 lobster traps](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article228822799.html) to Hurricane Irma.\n\n####U.S.-China trade war\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war has turned Maine - and Senator Susan Collins - into a target for retaliatory tariffs. Maine lobster exports to China increased by [169%](https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/maine-delegation-urges-aid-for-members-of-lobster-industry-affected-by-trade-war) from 2017 to 2018. In July 2018, the U.S. government placed a 25% tariff on Chinese goods. China retaliated with a 25% tariff on American goods, including live lobsters. On September 1, 2019, China retaliated again, raising the tariff to 35%. U.S. lobster exports to China have [declined by 80%](https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2019/08/26/how-chinas-tariffs-are-affecting-u-s-lobster-exports) while Canadian lobster exports doubled. The U.S. government instituted a 25% tariff on raw steel imported from Canada and Mexico from 2018-2019. The tariff only covered *raw* steel not finished products made from steel, inadvertently making imported [lobster traps](https://www.kvcrnews.org/post/got-lobster-trumps-steel-tariffs-threaten-trap-industry#stream/0) price competitive with American-welded traps. The U.S. Commerce Department is now weighing whether China and Mexico have [dumped](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-imposes-new-tariff-chinese-mexican-steel) steel, which could result in another round of anti-dumping tariffs.\n\nSome of the shift from 'American' to 'Canadian' lobster exports to China is contrived. Lobsters can grow to up to [four](https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2011/0616/How-large-can-lobsters-grow-Big!-But-no-one-knows-how-big) feet long, but lobster eggs are 1/16\". Lobster smuggling is a multi-million dollar enterprise in southeast Asia. Smugglers are now [trafficking American lobsters](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/supply-trade/us-companies-accused-of-dumping-lobster-in-asia) and [Australian rock lobsters](https://www.scmp.com/article/732369/rock-lobster-row-confirms-hk-asia-smuggling-hub) into China.\n\n####Climate change\n\nClimate change has been great for Maine lobstermen. The Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than 99% of the ocean, resulting in a [515% increase](https://www.gmri.org/news/news-archive/new-study-industry-conservation-ethic-proves-critical-gulf-maine-lobster-fishery) in Maine's lobster population over the last thirty years while other lobster populations elsewhere - like nearby Massachusetts - completely collapsed. However, warming waters also encouraged a growth in the [black sea bass](https://www.mvtimes.com/2019/03/12/black-sea-bass-gobbling-lobsters/) population, which gorge on baby lobsters.\n\nClimate change may make the Maine lobster population [fall as hard](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/1831) over the next thirty years as it rose over the last thirty years as lobsters permanently migrate north, avoiding the uncomfortably hot water in the Gulf of Maine. Our understanding of lobster biology is incomplete. For example, scientists did not know how to precisely determine a lobster's age until 2012, when the University of New Brunswick in Saint John found that [dissecting the eyestalks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/rings-on-a-lobster-can-tell-its-age-1.1235997) of decapod crustaceans reveals rings that grow once per year. Scientists still debate whether lobsters are capable of feeling pain. We know [American](https://www.boem.gov/espis/5/5659.pdf) and spiny lobsters are magnetoreceptive and that magnetic fields play a role in determining lobster migration (like birds), but we do not know *[why](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Lohmann/publication/299648639_Effect_of_magnetic_pulses_on_Caribbean_spiny_lobsters_Implications_for_magnetoreception/links/5762b58608ae17328926f4ad/Effect-of-magnetic-pulses-on-Caribbean-spiny-lobsters-Implications-for-magnetoreception.pdf?origin=publication_detail)* they are magnetoreceptive or how this influences their movements. Studies have repeatedly found that electromagnetic fields generated by [undersea power cables](https://www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Pacific-Region/Studies/2011-09-EMF-Effects.aspx) [influence](https://www.ecori.org/narragansett-bay/2019/9/11/sharks-lobsters-impacted-by-electric-cables-from-offshore-wind) lobster migration.\n\n####Temperature\n\nIn the 1920s, studies concluded the ideal temperature for lobster breeding is 15 ¬∞C (59 ¬∞F) or higher (Huntsman, 1923, 1924). From the 1960s to the 1980s, the scientific consensus placed ideal temperatures at a mean annual sea temperature of 8 to 11 ¬∞C (48 to 52 ¬∞F) (Dow, 1969: 1062-1063). Today, the scientific consensus is that lobsters cannot handle temperatures above [20¬∞C](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-lobsters) (68¬∞F). A [2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783616303150) study found that lobster larvae are negatively affected at 20-24 ¬∞C (68-75 ¬∞F), but die off at 24-36 ¬∞C (75-97 ¬∞F), and recommended further examination of the effect of temperature on lobster survival. In 1999, scientists first [identified](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/23/nyregion/deaths-of-lobsters-in-long-island-sound-tied-to-tiny-parasite.html) a parasite, paramoebiasis, which seemed to kill lobsters weakened by high temperatures during a mass die-off. Paramoebiasis passes between infected and healthy lobsters within weeks of cohabitation. There is no guarantee that water temperatures will continue to rise in the Gulf of Maine as we may be at or near the crest of the [Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-lobsters). The [American Lobster Settlement Index](https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2019/05/31/from-coast-to-coast-companies-team-up-to-fund-umaine-lobster-research/), first established in 1989, began surveying deep water lobster populations in 2016. ALSI is exploring the theory that lobsters are moving east into deeper (colder) water.\n\n####Mortality\n\nLobster catches and landings have always fluctuated over multi-year periods with several past scares of unexplained mass die-offs, leading to premature fears of lobster extinction. The average female lobster has 10,000 eggs and females can have up to [100,000](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/faq/faq-archive/fishfaq7.html) eggs, but the survival rate for baby lobsters in the wild is one tenth of one percent. In 2012, Norwegian aquarists [doubled](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/12/121204081144.htm) the survival rate by altering lobster feed in a controlled setting. Experimental aquarists lowered Caribbean spiny lobster mortality in captivity to 3-70% through repeated experimentation, altering lobster feed and sterilizing seawater. The [National Lobster Hatchery](https://www.nationallobsterhatchery.co.uk/) in Cornwall, England has raised and released more than [100,000](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-27499270) healthy lobsters in captivity. This suggests that aquaculture may mitigate the historically high mortality rate in lobster larvae.\n\n####Machias Seal Island\n\nThe U.S. and Canada both [claim](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2018/07/22/machias-seal-island-dispute) ownership of Machias Seal Island, a dispute that revolves around a 400-year old legal question. Canada argues that a 1621 land grant made Machias Seal Island part of Nova Scotia and that the 1783 Treaty of Paris exempted Nova Scotian islands from the islands Canada agreed belonged to the United States. The U.S. argues the grant did not make the island part of Nova Scotia and thus the Treaty of Paris recognized American sovereignty over the island. Canada controls the island itself and has had a lighthouse there since 1832. In [1984](https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/67), the International Court of Justice delimited boundaries for the U.S. and Canada, but did not consider the issue of Machias Seal Island. In 2002, Canada legalized lobster fishing in the Grey Zone, the waters around the island where American lobstermen had previously enjoyed exclusive access. Enhanced immigration enforcement in the Trump administration has seen U.S. Border Patrol authorities detain Canadians in the Grey Zone while American lobstermen have begun [arming](https://www.wgbh.org/news/arts/2019/01/29/theres-a-quiet-war-over-lobsters-near-the-canadian-border) themselves, threatening Canadian lobstermen, and there has been mutual lobster trap sabotage. In 2009, disputes between the residents of Matinicus Island, an American island slightly west of Machias Seal Island, and the mainland U.S. also led to [armed confrontations](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32054066/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/police-maine-lobster-turf-war-led-shooting/#.XYPyDCV7l0s), and in 1998, Monhegan Island residents successfully lobbied for exclusive rights to lobstering near their island.\n\n###Miskito, Nicaragua, and Honduras\n\nThe Miskito are a pre-Columbian, largely [Moravian](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009182968701500204?legid=spmis%3B15%2F2%2F49&patientinform-links=yes) Protestant people of 300,000. Their native land occupies eastern Honduras and Nicaragua. While Nicaragua and Honduras have a small share of the international lobster market, the lobster industry generates ‚Ç¨133 million/$100 million USD (2014) in revenue. They export most of their catch to the United States, particularly the Florida-based restaurant chain [Red Lobster](http://www.ipsnews.net/2004/02/honduras-death-looms-over-miskito-lobster-divers/). The Miskito [overwhelmingly](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/cag.1999.21.3.10) make up Nicaragua's lobster divers, but do not own the actual lobster boats, earning only a pittance for their lobster catch. While North American lobstermen trap their lobsters, most Miskito lobstermen dive, a practice that is illegal in most countries because of the danger to divers who decompress too quickly. While North American lobsters are shipped alive, Miskito lobstermen sell frozen lobsters, a far less valuable product. While some American lobstermen [earn six figure salaries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oceans-tide-lobster-specialreport/ocean-shock-lobsters-great-migration-sets-up-boom-and-bust-idUSKCN1N420I), the poverty and desperation of Miskito lobstermen have led them to dive farther out to sea at greater depths and out of season, taking younger, smaller catch, inflicting permanent ecological damage to the lobster population and physical damage to themselves.\n\n####Historical background\n\nThe Miskito nation became a British protectorate in 1638, an alliance that endured until 1860, when the British transferred sovereignty of the Miskito kingdom to Nicaragua (through the Treaty of Managua) while maintaining its self-governing autonomy. In 1894, the Nicaraguans annexed the Miskito's territory, violating the Treaty of Managua and triggering a brief British occupation. In the 1970s, the Miskito, Sumo, and Rama nations pressed Nicaragua's Somoza regime for land concessions and legally recognized self-rule, which they had had from 1860 to 1894. Somoza never gave in to their requests. In 1979, the Sandinista revolutionaries (FSLN) took control of Nicaragua and nationalized the seafood industry. Representatives of the three pre-Columbian nations presented Plan 81, defining formal borders for their lands. Instead of land reform and economic assistance, the Sandinistas [burned down and bombed](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/29/movies/on-13-sandinistas-vs-miskitos.html) Miskito villages, forcibly relocating the population they had economically disenfranchized. In 1985, the U.S. cut off all trade with Nicaragua, an embargo that lasted for four years. Nicaragua bypassed the order by presenting [millions of pounds of lobsters](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/19/world/us-gets-taste-of-managua-embargo.html) caught in Nicaragua as 'Honduran lobsters'. Japanese and Honduran lobstermen purchased lobster licenses, working in what Miskito considered their territory without their permission while the government [banned](https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1206/120652.html) lobster diving, which effectively shut out the Miskito from the industry because Miskito fishermen did not own lobster boats. In 1985, the American Indian Movement, which had been part of the international indigenous rights movement since the 1970s, threatened to [invade](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/11/world/us-indians-enlist-in-the-miskito-cause.html) Nicaragua. In 1988, they were finally granted autonomy (effective in 1990), and in 1990, the lobster ban was lifted.\n\nIn 2002 and 2006, the right-wing government of Enrique Bola√±os provoked threats of secession from the Miskito (in Nicaragua and Honduras) when he pushed for a transnational dry canal. The canal was never built, but in 2009, the Miskito, partly motivated by [declining lobster profits](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/world/americas/10nicaragua.html), declared independence and have since been in a decade-long low level war with the Nicaraguan government with accusations of violent attacks (including beheadings), land seizures, arson, kidnapping, and rape. In 2013, President Ortega, hated by the Miskito for the original lobster ban, granted a concession to a Hong Kong-based company to build a full, transnational canal through Miskito territory. The Miskito conflict is largely confined to Nicaragua as Honduras now [recognizes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/12/honduras-miskito-indians-title-coastal-lands/2807695/) Miskito sovereignty over a territory of 1.86 million acres (920,000 hectares), the land the Miskito had been guaranteed control over in 1860.\n\n####Lobsters and Cocaine\n\nCocaine traffickers have filled the void left by the Honduran government's withdrawal from Miskito lands. Honduras and Nicaragua do not have the mountains necessary to grow coca, but their location in between cocaine producing countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, and cocaine consuming countries, namely the U.S., has made the ungoverned Miskito space a natural transshipment point for Colombian and Mexican drug cartels since about 2007. Some Miskito lobstermen, unable to make a steady living fishing, have collaborated with traffickers. USAID recognized the lobster-cocaine link and since 2008 has spent [almost a million dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/world/americas/in-remote-honduras-area-drug-raid-stirs-anger.html) to beef up the lobster industry as part of its counter-narcotics strategy. Traffickers travel using planes and boats from Colombia to Bluefields, the capital of Nicaragua's Miskito territory. If traffickers think they have been spotted and risk arrest, they will dump their contraband into the ocean. The cocaine that is dumped and washes ashore is known as '[white lobster](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Nicaraguan-town-rides-high-on-cast-off-cocaine-3168753.php)'. Finding and selling dumped cocaine has become its own profession as the average cocaine package is worth more than ‚Ç¨91,000/$100,000 USD in a region with per capita incomes below ‚Ç¨5,400/$6,000 USD. Some Miskito nationalists in Nicaragua have [openly suggested](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13210289) collaborating with drug cartels and accepting that the Miskito economy is now a narco-economy.\n\n###Canada, France, and the UK\n\nThe Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 ended the War of Spanish Succession. It also recognized France's right to fish off the northern coast of Newfoundland, fishing rights that had survived the Seven Years War. In the late nineteenth century, Canadian lobstermen moved into French territory, setting up lobster processing factories and violating what the French saw as their exclusive right to fish off the coast. The French lodged official protests, worried about the impact of lobster traps on caplin, which the French used as fishing bait, and cod, which ate lobsters, the potential extinction of the local lobster population, and the seeming disinterest of the British Colonial Office in resolving the issue. The British argued that French fishing rights were concurrent with Canadian fishing rights, that the right to fish did not extend to lobsters because they are crustaceans not fish, and that France needed to negotiate with the Canadians. At the time however, many in England used the word *fish* to mean any animal that lives in the ocean. In 1886, a French warship destroyed a Canadian lobster factory at Port Saunders, and another lobster factory nearby in 1889. The Newfoundlanders responded with the Bait Acts, a series of laws that cut off French access to Canadian bait. The French and British maintained the dispute from 1881 until they reached a compromise, modifying French rights when they signed the Anglo-French Convention in 1904.\n\n###Japan and the U.S.\n\nIn 1964, the [Continental Shelf Convention](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXI-4&chapter=21&clang=_en) (CSC), an international treaty, recognized the exclusive right of nations to the territorial waters, sea beds, and natural resources therein that extends [200 nautical miles](https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/continental_shelf_description.htm) from a nation's continental shelf, known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The CSC includes *[sedentary species](https://www.oceansatlas.org/subtopic/en/c/20/)* in its definition of natural resources exclusively owned by adjacent coastal states. Fish are not included in this definition because they freely pass in and out of an EEZ. Lobsters (and crabs) defy easy categorization because while they are not embedded in sea soil like oysters or clams, they also do not swim through the ocean, they walk on the seafloor. Japanese fishermen had fished for crabs and lobsters in Alaska's continental shelf near the Aleutian Islands, so in 1964, the Japanese argued neither qualified as sedentary species. While the U.S. refrained from formally accepting that either are sedentary species, they compromised, allowing the Japanese to continue fishing in the continental shelf with annual quotas.\n\n###France and Brazil\n\nIn the 1960s, France and Brazil had a bloodless military confrontation known as the Lobster War over whether French fishermen had the right to fish for lobsters in Brazil's continental shelf. Mauritania gained its independence from France in 1960. French lobstermen worried they would lose access to Mauritanian fisheries, which had been in a twenty year decline, and began looking elsewhere for lobsters. In 1961, four French ships crossed the Atlantic to Brazil, catching 85,000 lobsters in one month. Brazil initially granted three ships the right to fish off their coast, but dozens of ships followed, so Brazil banned foreign lobster fishing altogether. Fishermen ignored the ban, and in 1962, a massive haul of lobster prompted the Brazilian navy to start boarding French boats. The Brazilian government argued that lobsters traverse the sea floor and therefore were part of the continental shelf, which Brazil exclusively held sway over. France argued lobsters swim like fish and are therefore not part of the continental shelf. The Brazilians [suggested](https://www.vice.com/fr/article/qvg3vp/quand-le-bresil-et-la-france-declenchaient-une-guerre-pour-quelques-langoustes) that if lobsters are fish because they live in water, then kangaroos are birds because they jump in the air.\n\nOn January 30, 1963, the Brazilian government boarded and seized three French fishing boats. The French navy sent warships, including a destroyer and an aircraft carrier, to Brazil, and Brazil deployed its navy. France took the issue to the International Court of Justice, but before a decision could be rendered, in 1964, the Brazilian military overthrew President Goulart in a coup d'√©tat. His successor, Castelo Branco, signed a deal accommodating French interests in December 1964, allowing some French lobstermen to fish for five years. In 1966, Brazil took another group of French fishermen when they illegally fished off Fortaleza. In 1969, the Brazilians expanded their designated territorial seas to 12 miles out, and in 1970, they expanded it to 200 miles from their coast.\n\n###Further reading\n\n*The Lobster Gangs of Maine* by James M.

The catch was that shortly after being found guilty Honduras ruled the laws were invalid in Honduras, including retroactively. The Honduran government sent officials to testify that they could never have been convicted in Honduras.

    "body": "I used to post on GOMI analyzing the ingredients of different Glossier formulations and would generally comment on their product releases, but I thought I'd move to reddit for this one since I think it's more helpful here.\n\nMe: I work in the beauty industry on the product development side and because of that I'm constantly testing new products from competitors either just to keep up with the industry or when clients bring them in as comparisons. Recently I came across a product that I thought omg, I need to post this on reddit bc there are a ton of people who would probably want to know this.\n\nThis post will cover the first [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) dupe which is a 99.999% match, is half the price (or usually less) - and the sole difference is that it has a different fragrance.\n\nIf you look up ‚ÄúGlossier Milky Jelly Dupes‚Äù the one that is always coming up is the Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser. That one is annoying because is not a real dupe at all; it‚Äôs just vaguely texturally similar and has a similar bottle, but the formulation has nearly nothing in common with Milky Jelly in any way. Kind of pointless.\n\nPresenting the last word in Milky Jelly dupes, the [ELF Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9). It is \\*nearly identical in every way\\* to Milky Jelly and is usually on sale for $3. Srsly.\n\nIngredients comparison:\n\nE.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser Ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 184, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, Isohexadecane, Xylitylglucoside, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Vb5), Hydroxyacetophenone, Isopropyl Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Xylitol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThese formulations are nearly identical. They have the same cleansing agents in almost exactly the same order, and even the same textural ingredients. E.L.F. was definitely duplicating the formula exactly when they were formulating.\n\nAs I've said, I've tested the E.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser and the Milky Jelly face wash and they are nearly identical. The texture is bang-on and the use experience is the same. There is just one real difference - the Glossier cleanser uses rosewater as the scent ingredient, and the Bounce Back uses a coconut fragrance. I‚Äôm sensitive to fragrances and it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, it‚Äôs pretty light.\n\nThe best part? The E.L.F. Bounce Back Milky Jelly dupe is $6.00 for 100ml.\n\n$6.\n\nAnd when I ordered it for testing, it was actually $3 because E.L.F. always has sales.\n\nTo compare, Glossier Milky Jelly is $18.00 for 177ml + shipping.\n\nWhere to buy the Bounce Back: it‚Äôs is a little annoying, since they don‚Äôt have it in Target, or on Amazon it seems, but you can get it on the ELF website. Here‚Äôs the link:\n\n[https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9)\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I don't work for ELF, and never have, and think most of their products are very mediocre. But this one is clearly a copy of something already tested and popular (and I don't feel bad about sharing it because the Glossier Milky Jelly was a total rip-off/copy of the LaRoche Posay Physiological Gel, soooo)",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>‚ÄúI live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I‚Äôm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I‚Äôll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.‚Äù\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don‚Äôt object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a ‚Äútrue‚Äù hydroxy acid ‚Äî it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned ‚Äúrules‚Äù of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn‚Äôt the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0.

[Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. ‚ÄúPCA SKIN‚Äù also has another product with AzA called ‚ÄúACNE GEL‚Äù. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the ‚Äúpigment bar‚Äù it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There‚Äôs also ‚Äú*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*‚Äù you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion‚Äù\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There‚Äôs 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description‚Äôs wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low ‚Äî meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time?

Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6.

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin‚Äôs outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin‚Äôs water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin‚Äôs barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates‚Äîaspirin‚Äôs technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics.

Baking soda gets you quite good results, but it‚Äôs not the real thing. However, I have a background in chemistry lab work and respect the danger involved - I quarantine the kitchen for this stage and use PPE accordingly. I‚Äôd never recommend this method to anyone that doesn‚Äôt understand the risk involved. The risk-to-reward just isn‚Äôt there. So when food scientist/perfectionist Alton Brown recommends baking soda for his pretzel recipe, he‚Äôs making the right choice.\n\nIt got me thinking, what are some dangerous recipes that require full attention to do properly?",

[\\[S\\]](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions)\n* As CO2 concentrations build in the atmosphere, infrared light radiated from earth's surface is absorbed by the CO2. Thus trapping heat in earth's atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. [\\[S\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)\n* 38% of global CO2 emissions have dissolved in the oceans. When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid. This is known as ocean acidification.

[\\[S\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub)\n* As the ocean becomes more acidic, less CO2 is able to be stored in the water. This leads to CO2 being released from the ocean and sent to the atmosphere. The same goes for ocean temperature. As water temperature rises, less CO2 is able to stay dissolved (e.g. leave a carbonated drink out on a warm day). [\\[S\\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000533)\n* As temperatures rise, soil begins to increase the release of carbon in a process known as soil respiration. Researchers estimate soil carbon loss over the 21st century will be equivalent to two decades of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. [\\[S\\]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874)\n\n# Solutions:\n\n* **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Use mafic and ultramafic rocks (olivine, peridotite, etc.) to bind to CO2 and form carbonates. Thus converting CO2 into an alkaline carbonate mineral. These carbonates could then be placed in the ocean to raise the pH and bring it back to normal levels, and increase CO2 storage capacity in the ocean.

The CO2 can be converted into a long term storage medium such as a carbonate or left as vapor CO2. In the case of vapor CO2 there is some commercial value or it can be pumped into geological wells for storage.

This would free up billions of acres globally, democratize access to protein sources, and eliminate CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with factory farming. In the United States 41% of land use goes towards grazing and animal feed crops. These areas of land are usually high in sunlight and could be used for solar, wind, afforestation, or DAC.

[\\[S\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber)\n* **Afforestation:** Afforestation is the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Tree-planting campaigns are sometimes criticized for targeting areas where forests would not naturally occur, such as grassland and savanna biomes. Afforestation can negatively affect ecosystems through increasing fragmentation, edge effects, and making the surface albedo darker (especially in northern regions).

    "body": "It's a really common misconception which I'm seeing in this subreddit a fair bit. Bamboo trees themselves are a sustainable renewable material (although there's the caveat that bamboo mono plantations aren't the best idea either). But the way bamboo material is manufactured, the vast majority of bamboo clothing that you find on the market is bamboo viscose or rayon - semi-synthetic fibres which are created using highly toxic chemicals which are then deposited into the environment. Most of this is made in countries like China, Vietnam and India where it's hard to trace what's really happening (source - SBS). Tencel textiles are certified for their sustainable practices (conservation of water, less toxic chemicals, FSC-certified forests only, closed loop processes, organic), but most bamboo products on the market are not like this. Even Tencel, the most sustainable form of bamboo material, is [not as sustainable as recycled cotton.](https://www.treehugger.com/what-is-tencel-5198098)\n\nSome more reading:\n\n[**The difference between Tencel and lyocell**](https://cariki.co.uk/blogs/the-green-road/difference-between-tencel-and-lyocell)\n\n**From SBS News:** [**Have we had the bamboo pulled over our eyes when it comes to this 'natural' fibre?**](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/have-we-had-the-bamboo-pulled-over-our-eyes-when-it-comes-to-this-natural-fibre/p46tchnsr)\n\n* Material labelled as 'bamboo' in Australia may be better described as 'bamboo-derived.'\n* Chemicals are used to break down bamboo fibres, which go through a process to make viscose.\n* When broken down, bamboo fibres no longer offer UV protection or anti-microbial properties.\n* Textiles experts, including two who have spoken to SBS News, describe the marketing of bamboo fabric in recent years as an exercise in ‚Äò[greenwashing](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/greta-thunberg-coca-cola-and-cop27-why-greenwashing-is-overshadowing-the-un-climate-summit/sq6vv0bjl)‚Äô and one that has proven lucrative for those who've run with it.\n\n**From The Green Hub Online:** [**How sustainable is bamboo and is it really all that eco-friendly?** ](https://thegreenhubonline.com/how-sustainable-is-bamboo-and-is-it-really-eco-friendly/)\n\n\"For bamboo to be turned into bamboo viscose, cellulose is extracted from the plant through the use of harsh chemicals. It is then fed through a spinneret so the strands can solidify to make a fibre. Among the chemicals used in this process are sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid,  and carbon disulfide.\n\nThese chemicals are incredibly harmful to living creatures and the environment. The use of chemicals in factories affects factory workers, pollutes the air, and infects nearby water systems...\n\nTo make things worse, depending on the factory, chemicals such as carbon di-sulphate and zinc sulphate are released as bi-products during the viscose process. Both these chemicals are highly toxic to water-based organisms. If the chemicals are not disposed of as hazardous waste, they‚Äôre washed away into water systems.\"",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "**TL;DR: Skip to second half. ^^Fake ^^toyo! ^^Sad!**\n\nWhat do you picture whenever you think of how soy sauce is made? If you‚Äôre like me, you imagined big clay pots containing a mishmash of soybeans, wheat, and salt. With time, refining, and a lot of help from fungi and bacteria, out comes a product that we all know and love, toyo or soy sauce. It‚Äôs a simple production method that‚Äôs been around for millenia. To my surprise, this isn‚Äôt how all soy sauces are made.\n \nBack then, soy sauce was made at home by cooking soybeans, adding wheat to it, putting it on bamboo trays, and letting it ferment for a few days. After it became moldy, it‚Äôs put  in a jar with brine then filtered through cloth. Tada! Soy sauce is born.\n \nToday, there are two main methods that we use to produce soy. The first one is **traditional fermentation** based on what the Japanese do. A special type of mold (*Aspergillus oryzae*), one that we also use for making *tausi*, is allowed to grow in cooked rice. The rice is then dried and ground. What results is something called *koji*. The *koji* is then added to cooked soybeans and roasted wheat flour. That concoction is then allowed to ferment on its own. It‚Äôs put in a brine solution and more microorganisms are added for additional fermentation and the development of flavor. They‚Äôre left to party for up to a year. The delicious mixture is then filtered, pasteurized, mixed with a preservative, then bottled. There are differences between the Chinese style and the Japanese style, but similar processes occur.\n \nThe second one is **chemical hydrolysis**. It sounds yummy, doesn‚Äôt it? It involves soybeans and wheat flour too, but that mixture is hydrolysed by boiling it in *hydrochloric acid*, neutralization with *sodium hydroxide*, and mixing it with brine. The whole process takes only a few days. The result doesn‚Äôt taste or smell like your regular soy sauce. To make it taste better, this method was modified by adding the microorganisms from the traditional method and allowing it to ferment for 3 months. Enhancers like MSG and caramel are added to make the product more appealing. It‚Äôs way faster (and usually cheaper) than fermentation. \n \nIt‚Äôs a contest between natural and chemical. Quality versus price. Nowadays, instead of using whole soybeans, the product left from making soybean oil is used. \n\n_____\n\n**Why am I telling you this?** Well, that‚Äôs because in the Philippines, the following types of soy sauce are available:\n\n* Fermented soy sauce\n* Hydrolysed soy sauce\n* Blend of both\n* Synthetic soy sauce made with the spent liquor from MSG manufacturing, brine, caramel, and flavoring\n \nThe standards we have for most of those types are practically the same. The types that you'll probably see in the markets are the blended/formulated ones. Soy sauces with caramel, flavor enhancers, dyes etc. They‚Äôre usually cheaper and therefore more popular. With regards to safety, they are generally recognized as safe, as far as I know anyway. But be sure to check any advisories by the FDA. \n\n[Here‚Äôs a partial list by DOH-FDA \\(2011\\) of safe soy sauce products](http://www.doh.gov.ph/sites/default/files/health_advisory/fda202011015.pdf) AND [make sure to avoid the products listed here.](http://www.fda.gov.ph/advisories-2/food-2/425170-fda-advisory-no-2017-096)\n\n**Which soy sauce do you use then? How are you supposed to know whether something comes from fermentation or hydrolysis?** \n \nAccording to our national product standards, manufacturers are required to specify in their labels whether or not their soy sauce comes from fermented soybeans, hydrolysed soybean protein (or plant protein), or if it‚Äôs a mixture of both. That has been a standard since 1993. Unfortunately, it still isn‚Äôt being strictly followed.\n \nWhat we can do is check the ingredients list to at least get some idea of how the product was made. What they exactly mean, I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but I did see these ingredients in the following brands:\n\nIngredient | Product\n---|---\nHydrolyzed soybean/soy protein | Datu Puti Soy Sauce, Knorr Liquid Seasoning\nHydrolyzed Protein Extracted from Wheat Flour | SM Bonus Chinese Soy Sauce\nBiologically Hydrolysed Wheat Protein | Maggi Savor\nSoybean extract | Golden Swan Soy Sauce, Lorins Soy Sauce, Marca Lapu Lapu, Mother‚Äôs Best Soy Sauce, Select Soy Sauce, Silver Swan Soy Sauce\nSoybeans/soya bean | Carp Premium Soy Sauce, Coconut Brand Premium Soy Sauce, Kikkoman, Lee Kum Kee Soy Sauce, Maggi Soy Sauce, Marca Pi√±a Soy Sauce, SM Bonus Premium Soy Sauce, Sure Buy Seasoning, Uncle Tom Soy Sauce\n\nThere are very few soy sauces that indicated that they were brewed or fermented. Here are the few that I found:\n\nLabel | Product\n---|---\nNaturally brewed | Datu Puti Brewed Soy Sauce (the one in a fancy bottle), Golden Swan Soy Sauce, Kikkoman, Lee Kum Kee Soy Sauce\nNaturally fermented | Carp Premium Soy Sauce, Coconut Brand Premium Soy Sauce, Maggi Soy Sauce\nFermented soybeans | Uncle Tom Soy Sauce\nHydrolyzed and fermented | Tentay Soy Sauce\n\nIt‚Äôs not an exhaustive list, but I hope it helps a bit. Had trouble viewing those tables? [Here they are in picture form.](https://imgur.com/a/rFkWg)\n\nTo sum it up, if you want to buy naturally fermented soy sauce, check whether the label actually says it‚Äôs fermented or brewed. If it doesn‚Äôt specify, assume that it isn‚Äôt. If it does, you should still look at the ingredients because it doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't hydrolysed. Look at the labels for any keywords like hydrolyzed/hydrolysed, extract, naturally brewed, fermented etc. that will help you identify how that soy sauce was made. The simpler the ingredients list, the better.\n\nEDIT: Concerned about safety? I talk about it lightly in these comments ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/6h581d/the_toyo_you_use_may_not_be_what_you_think_it_is/diwuj4f/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/6h581d/the_toyo_you_use_may_not_be_what_you_think_it_is/divux9j/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/6h581d/the_toyo_you_use_may_not_be_what_you_think_it_is/divqsxu/)).\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

        "body": "all these people asking what toyo to buy... here are my inputs:\n\nIn my opinion, if you are very health conscious ~~you need to~~ and have a bigger budget, you'd probably want those that are supposedly ***processed *naturally*** (naturally brewed and naturally fermented) and have the **most *organic* sounding** (soybeans/soya beans) ingredients.\n\nIn the brands mentioned above, I have tried *Maggi and Kikkoman*. The difference between the two is that:\n\n* ***Maggi*** has a sweetness to it and the ingredients indicated in the bottle has a bit more \"chemical\" sounding ingredients (ex: MSG and Acetic acid) compared to the latter.\n\n* ***Kikkoman*** is a bit saltier than the former and the only \"chemical\" sounding ingredient indicated in the bottle is sodium benzoate. \n\nBetween the two, healthwise, I'd pick/recommend ***Kikkoman*** but for some dishes I like it when Maggi is used.\n\nBased on the list, the next choice I have tried and recommend is:\n\n* ***Marca Pina*** which is what we buy if we can't afford the first two choices. Based on the list above, it's difference with Silverswan is that Marca Pina uses soybeans/soya beans. I can't really say much because we don't have it in stock (because this is what we always use).\n\nThe next brands, I don't really have differentiation healthwise (before this post), it's more of preferences and more budget-friendly choices:\n\n* ***Silverswan*** has very similar ingredients with *Kikkoman* except that Silverswan uses soybean extract and has caramel. (I have compared the ingredients indicated on the bottle). Based on taste, Kikkoman has a more \"savory\" type of saltiness to it while Silverswan has a more \"fishy\" saltiness or, if I make sense, it's \"salty\" salty.\n\n* ***Datu Puti*** is the what we buy if there is no Silverswan sa tindahan haha but based on the list I guess this is not the most healthiest choice(?). We don't have it in stock now so I can't compare the taste or the other ingredients, but I do remember that I prefer Datu Puti for sawsawan and Silverswan for cooking.\n\n*disclaimer: my mother is the cook and she's health conscious. I'm ~~a picky eater~~ just very aware of food tastes and ~~subconsciously~~ inherited my mom's health consciousness ~~paranoia~~ haha\n\nTLDR: Here's the simplest and most practical ranking: ***Kikkoman, Marca Pina, Silverswan***",

    "body": "I work in the wastewater industry. My previous employment was at water reclamation plant (poo poo plant) for a county. We processed up to 32 million gallons of wastewater a day and I worked midnights Tuesday to Saturday right as the heavy flows came in. The company had 7 wastewater operators retiring in a span of 6 months and the department manager, we will call him \"Warmaster Horus\" as he ruled with an \"iron first\", refused to allow more than 1 person from other departments to train at a time for a period of 9 months so needless to say we were short handed. My plant manager, who we will call \"Little Horace\" was a very arrogant, a bully, and an unpleasent person to be around. He also had a tendency to target one person to blame all the problems of the plant on until that person transferred out to another plant or quit and went somewhere else. My shift partner was the last target and she left to go to another plant. So I pulled 278 hours of OT that year since no one else wanted to work graveyard shift and the guy they hired 4 months later quit after 8 days because of this guy. So I knew how the plant run inside and out, plus having a background in industrial maintenance, I knew when things were not running at optimal and when equipment had went down. Unfortunately for me, I was the new target. \n\nLittle Horus started out by asking how I ran my shift. Over the course of a few weeks he would ask me how I got certain numbers on tests I ran. One day he came at me as I was getting into my vehicle to leave saying that I didnt put enough information about potential problems into the log for the next shift. Tired, angry from being on my 14th day in a row, and having experience in leaving detailed explanations from having to write a 6 page essay on how to drink out of a canteen when I was in the marines, I obliged him. So the next night I made a 1631 word log into the notes for the next shift. I described the weather outside, smells at each station, how the equipment ran and sounded as I checked all 18 stations, each test with color, pH, temperature, consistency, texture, potential issues that might arise from the stages based on what each test showed, etc. I got called into his office the next morning to ask if I was trying to be funny with what i wrote. I told him, \"No, you wanted detailed notes about potential problems in the log for the next shift so thats what I did. You know from our training classes for our state licenses that part of making changes is by visual inspections and odors.  He told me that I was correct but leaving notes like that is considered insorboordination amd that if I left more like that I would be written up. Dead faced, I just said \"okay\" and left.\n\n The next night while making my first sample pulls for process control testing, I noticed the alkalinity of the lower than the SOP limit, so in order to get it to go up, we use Sodium Hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide is very corrosive, it makes pvc brittle and can even disolve certain metals. So I went to go to our chemical room to start up the hydroxide pump. The cpvc piping in the chemical room was a mess of pipes running in and out, crossing over others and all connected to other lines for redundancy incase one pump fails, another can be started. I started the first pump and it immediately starts spewing hydroxide out of the top of it all over the containment area. So I close the 6 valves piped to it and open the 6 other valves to run to the second pump. I start it up and run it in auto so the computer program can adjust according to flow coming in. It immediately starts running at 100% and all the pipes start shaking and pulling on the clamps holding it to the unistrut in the wall. Too much hydroxide is bad as it will kill the bacteria we use to eat the organic wastes. So I switch the pump in manual and do some quick algebra to match pump speed to flow coming into the plant to settle at around 50 pump strokes a minute. In auto it was pumping 160 strokes a minute. I make a note in the computer of what I find and in bold letters, \"Do not run pump in auto, scada is running it at 100% regardless of influent plant flow.\" Next shift comes in and I inform them of what I found and they need to get the PLC programmer on staff in to check scada.\n\n\nThe next day I see a note on the SOP board stating, \" Do not run hydroxide pumps in hand. Only run them in auto.\" I just shake my head in disbelief. So I run the pump in auto and just watch as the pump shakes all of the piping and leave to finish my rounds. After 4 hours I can turn the pump off. I make my notes and eventually leave for a much needed 4 day weekend.\n\nI come in the next Tuesday and feel my blood pressure rise about 20 points as my body crossed the threshold into the main office door. I walk into the control room to the out going shift telling me that we cant run hydroxide as the only other pump we have blew out the cpvc lines and it dumped 10,000 gallons of hydroxide into the containment area. About $16,000 in cost. It blew out on the shift after me as no one check it for 2 hours after they started up the pump. Nearly the whole tank drained intothe contaient area, which the valve was open there and it was going into the raw sewage well. Needless to say it slugged the plant pretty bad for 3 days as it killed a portion of our bacteria. They also said Little Horus was cussing my name for being the one who broke it. So I knew what was coming. Sure enough 7 hours and 45 minutes later I am in Warmaster Horus' office with Little Horus interrogating me as to why I didnt say anything about the piping being broken. I said, \" I didnt break the pipes. Infact, I left a note last week in the logs that the pump needs to be ran in hand as in auto it is running 100% regardless of flow. I evem told day shift we needed the PLC guy. I came in the next night amd you had written on the SOP board to only run the remaining pump in auto.\" Warmaster Horus looked at Little Horus and asked what day so he could review them. So I pointed it out in my notes and I was dismissed from the office while Little Horus had to stay and the door was shut. The next morning Little Horus apologized to me, at the orders of the Warmaster, for saying I am the one who broke the piping. He quickly shifted the subject into how I was still partly responsible for poor communication.. It was a rather enjoyable moment, though little did they know I was in the process of being hired onto another job in the same industry.\n\nTL;DR manager at my old job was an arrogant bully. Bad decision on his part caused a toxic spill into our plant and nearly killed all the bacteria used for processing sewage.\n\nWritten on mobile so excuse the errors.",

This is such an honor, it is an interspecies university where the brightest minds of the whole galaxy gather to share their wisdom and knowledge. There is so much I think I can learn here.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.1** ***‚Äì Entry Dean Hed‚Äôuphis:*** As instructed despite, my protest, I selected a human candidate from the pile of applications. I don‚Äôt know what the board thinks I can do with such a young species. They are too new to bring much to the table. From what we have been told about this race, they are impulsive at best and chaotic at worse. Further, we don‚Äôt know how our students will react to us bringing such a primitive on board as a professor. Some of them will likely know a lot more than this new professor. Best assign this professor to an area where he will have the least negative impact.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.3 ‚Äì Entry Professor Clay Moore:** Reporting in, I met Dean Hed‚Äôuphis today, he seems a nice enough fellow though a bit stuffy. He gave me the standard lecture that I am expected to teach classes while still pursuing my own research grants. Thankfully, I have been assigned to the science and engineering department. He tried to assign me to the Xeno-relations Department, but that would have been a disaster. I have no experience in this field. It looks like the first class I have been assigned to teach is Chemistry. I have also started writing up some grant proposals.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.3** ***‚Äì Entry Dean Hed‚Äôuphis:*** Today I met our new human professor, a male of the species named Clay Moore. This species is more intimidating than I originally expected. Professor Moore initially came across as pleasant until we told him we were assigning him to the Xeno-Relations course. At this, he initially appeared flustered before his face started to turn red and he became louder and more aggressive than I expected of an academic of any species. Truly a primitive race, he insisted on being part of the science and engineering department. Not wishing to have to face the board again over my concerns, I relented, and we are letting him teach Chemistry 101. Being all charts, that should be safe.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.7 ‚Äì Entry Professor Clay Moore:** It was a great day today, I taught three periods of chemistry with great effect. I figured the best way to engage my students in the course was to demonstrate some of what you could do with a working knowledge of chemistry. I started with the classic Electrolysis demonstration to show how knowledge of the elements can be practical. The first period students were politely attentive as I explained that Chemistry was the study of matter and introduced the periodic table to them. But you could feel the very air of the class change as I brought out the water bath and my tools. I explained to them I was able to change the chemical properties of the water by using electricity to strip hydrogen atoms from the O2 in order to collect the hydrogen. Then to prove it to them I lit the small amount of hydrogen I had collected into the beaker to generate a loud woop. You should have seen them jump. Interestingly, my second period class had 10 additions and my third period doubled in size after this. Last universities I taught in people dropped out after the first course, it is so exciting to see so many species willing to learn.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.7** ***‚Äì Entry Dean Hed‚Äôuphis:*** I am in shock I think. Chemistry 101 should be a painfully boring class. The day started off normally, but after the first period of the day, there was a rush on admissions with people requesting to change their professors. While not uncommon on the first day of the cycle, what was surprising was how many were requesting Professor Moore‚Äôs chemistry class. Later I found out that Professor Moore had setup a ‚ÄúPractical demonstration‚Äù of the benefits of basic chemistry. To the shock of everyone there, he produced a tub of Dihydrogen-Monoxide and then proceeded using only an electrical current to make Hydrogen. While, an impressive feat for such a primitive race, what he did next was to light the hydrogen on fire. The explosion was heard throughout much of that floor of the building. From what I have learned, the first period students shared their recordings of the lecture and that drove the current rush. I can only assume his primitive race learned this technique as a way of acquiring Hydrogen because they didn‚Äôt know how to farm gas giants.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.9 ‚Äì Entry Professor Clay Moore:** Today‚Äôs class was amazing. I have never seen students so focused as we started a course on types of Reactions. We discussed the differences between combination reactions, decomposition reactions, single displacement reactions, and double displacement reactions. For the practical demonstration, I used managed to get a hold of some mercury (II) oxide. I showed them how by applying heat I could break the solid mercury(II) Oxide down into liquid mercury and gaseous oxygen. Seeing the liquid mercury seemed to absolutely fascinate the students. They were so excited they even told the Dean who personally came down to see the demonstration. He was speechless at the end, undoubtedly impressed with how much these students are learning in this class. Perhaps I should have a lab where I let the students do some of these projects first hand.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.9** ***‚Äì Entry Dean Hed‚Äôuphis:*** For the sake of the galaxy, I hope Professor Moore is unique and other humans are not like him.\n\nI started my day with a deluge of communications from 6 different races all wanting to offer Professor Moore a grant to help them develop hydrogen farming techniques more cost effective than mining gas planets.  His electrolysis experiment had made its way back to many of the student's home planets and the responses from their governments had downright shocked him..\n\nAdditionally, to my horror, I found out he had smuggled Mercury Oxide into the university to use in another of his ‚Äúpractical demonstrations.‚Äù At first, I didn‚Äôt believe the students, but they insisted I come down and see. I am asking security to review how he even got his hands on such a toxic compound. Even a small amount is fatal to almost every known species, even as absurdly resilient as Humans are it can cause organ failure.\n\nThen to the horror of every species present, he burned it producing Liquid Mercury! Liquid Mercury! This element is extremely toxic and no sane species would ever want to create it. I asked Professor Moore what possible reason his race would have to want to create mercury. He pointed me to the human network site [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)). Humans have used this stuff for everything from cosmetics to medicine. They even tried using it to create new metals at one point.\n\nWe can‚Äôt afford to turn away the grants, and this is the most excitement over Chemistry 101 I have ever seen.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.10** ***‚Äì Entry Dean Hed‚Äôuphis:*** As if endangering himself wasn‚Äôt enough, today I received a request by Professor Moore to hold a chemistry Lab. Reviewing his request, he wants to let students attempt his ‚ÄúPractical Examples‚Äù themselves. I immediately declined it due to lack of safety equipment. I have taken this up with the board, but they seem to think the Human is doing a great job. They just see the numbers from the grants and recent shift of students requesting to transfer here for Chemistry 101.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.11 ‚Äì Entry Professor Clay Moore:** The dean denied my request to conduct a lab due to a lack of safety equipment. As I look around, I realize he is probably right. We don‚Äôt have any eye-wash stations or even an emergency shower installed. I have gotten with maintenance and they have gotten one from earth for me, but apparently many races have no such devices. I guess the students for now will just have to watch my experiments.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.13 ‚Äì Entry Professor Clay Moore:** Today was a disaster, I fear I may lose my job. The classes started off well enough, we were teaching the differences between chemical and physical changes on matter. I completely forgot my audience. I started off by showing the effects of chemical changes using traditional examples like applying heat to an egg when you cook it, then showing how you can cause oxidation on iron, and finally the mixing of Hydrochloric Acid and Sodium Hydroxide to make salt water.\n\nDuring the second period one of the student All‚Äôair, an avian looking species, fainted when I started frying the egg. Only too late did it occur to me this was likely not a good example to show an egg laying species. Realizing my mistake, I quickly tried to dispose of the egg, but accidentally knocked of the small amount of Hydrochloric Acid I had, which mixed with some bleach.\n\nOnly then did I learn that the Norag species are extremely sensitive to chlorine.  All six of the Norag students present immediately passed out. While we got them all out safely and they were only exposed to a trivial amount of the chemical, all the Norag‚Äôs required hospitalization.  I traveled over with them and made sure all we well on their way to recovery. They seemed surprised by this, I made sure to address them all by name as I apologized.\n\nThe All‚Äôair also filed a complaint regarding the lesson. I spoke with Qali, the student who had passed out and gave her my sincere apologies for doing such an action. I couldn‚Äôt hold back my tears as I spoke with her and vowed to be more sensitive in the future.\n\nI feel horrible to have hurt my students. I have a meeting for tomorrow with Dean Hed‚Äôuphis, I may be about to be fired but can‚Äôt say I would fault him.\n\nAs the first human to ever hold this position, I‚Äôm greatly embarrassed for how this appears for both me and my race.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.13** ***‚Äì Entry Dean Hed‚Äôuphis:*** Disaster, that is the only word that describes it. The human‚Äôs practical demonstrations hospitalized six students and has now driven the All‚Äôair to file a formal complaint about the treatment of eggs.\n\nWhat‚Äôs worse, I expected the board to let me fire him and be done with this incredibly dangerous species.\n\nInstead, I was told that 10 more grants had come in after the first six. His grants represent the largest single source of income coming into our university in my tenure. I was also informed that the All‚Äôair had withdrawn their complaint, the student had reached out to her people and told them that Professor Moore apologized for his insensitivity in apparently a very moving way. Even the Norag have refused to lodge a complaint, they show an amazing loyalty to a professor who hospitalized them.\n\nI have been instructed to give him a safer course to teach and to get him working on his grants. This Professor is going to be the end of me.\n\n**Galactic Cycle 153234.14** ***‚Äì Entry Professor Clay Moore:*** Dean Hed‚Äôuphis must have really gone to bat for me. I expected my meeting today to end in my great disgrace and firing. Instead, I am going to be asked to teach a different course and I have been given 16 new projects and my own lab.\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine what Dean Hed‚Äôuphis must have said, but he must really like me to go to bat for me like this. I swear I won‚Äôt let him down, this Physics class he has asked me to teach will be the most engaging one yet!\n\nThe Dean does seem stressed lately, maybe I should get him a cat.",

    "body": "‚ÄúI want to make Maya her favorite food, can you help?‚Äù Limmie looks over the table in the canteen at Peggy, the only other human she knows here.\n\n  \n‚ÄúUh, maybe Lim, what‚Äôs her favorite food? Also, you know that most human foods‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äô\n\n  \n‚ÄúAre toxic to me, yes I know. This one doesn‚Äôt seem to bad though? It‚Äôs mostly wheat. I can eat wheat, though I shouldn‚Äôt eat too much. It‚Äôs just wheat and water, some sugar, yeast and salt.‚Äù\n\n  \nPeggy thinks a moment. ‚ÄúSome kind of bread?‚Äù\n\n  \nLimmie‚Äôs nod is so vigorous her ears flutter. ‚ÄúYeah, something called a pretzel.‚Äù\n\n  \nPeggy‚Äôs eyes widen slightly. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not all that‚Äôs involved in pretzels.‚Äù She stands. ‚ÄúBut, I think we can work something out. Come on, let‚Äôs sign out a kitchenette.‚Äù\n\n  \nA few days later, Limmie comes to the kitchenette that Peggy signed out. They get it for a whole day, which surprised Limmie. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just bread right? Why do we need it for a whole day?‚Äù\n\n  \n‚ÄúWell, we have to give time for the yeast to work.‚Äù Peggy is wearing an apron that says ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Get Baked!‚Äù And has a cartoon of a bread loaf with bloodshot eyes. She‚Äôs getting bowls out and arranging things on the steel table in front of her. ‚ÄúHer favorite is German pretzels?‚Äù\n\n  \n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. She said that she misses them because only her Grandmother makes them right. She sounded so wistful.‚Äù Limmie washes her hands, and as she dries them, Peggy hands her a smaller apron. On the front is written ‚ÄúMade from Scratch!‚Äù And has a cartoon K‚Äôlaxi showing their claws. Limmie looks at Peggy who is trying very hard not to laugh. She puts the apron on and flicks her ears in a grin.\n\n  \nPeggy spend the time showing Limmie what to do to make the dough, but she doesn‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs for Limmie‚Äôs girlfriend, so she does the work. She mixes the flour and the water and the yeast and while is proofs, Peggy explains how the yeast works and what it‚Äôs doing. Limmie leans in close and smells the yeasty smell and is amazed that human foods can get this‚Ä¶ complicated.\n\n  \nSoon enough the bread has risen and been punched down and shaped and‚Ä¶ Peggy is putting on a large rubber apron, heavy gloves and a face shield. Limmie stands back ‚ÄúUh, Peggy, what are you doing?‚Äù\n\n  \n‚ÄúOh, the pretzels aren‚Äôt done yet, they need a Lye bath.‚Äù\n\n  \n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù\n\n  \nPeggy‚Äôs voice is slightly muffled from the shield. ‚ÄúOh, Lye is a human word for Sodium Hydroxide, a very strong alkaline chemical. It is quite caustic to organic tissue, hence the PPE.‚Äù\n\n  \nLimmie takes an unconscious step back. ‚ÄúBut, what are you doing then? You‚Äôre going to ruin our bread!‚Äù\n\n  \n‚ÄúNo no, this is an important step. The pretzels won‚Äôt look or smell or taste right unless we dip them in lye.‚Äù\n\n  \n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to DIP the pretzels into a strong alkaline solution?‚Äù\n\n  \nPeggy turns, holding another rubber apron, gloves, and face shield. ‚ÄúNo. You‚Äôre going to.‚Äù\n\n  \n‚ÄúThis isnt‚Äô a joke? You‚Äôre not trying to make fun of me for not understanding human cookery? You really have to dip the pretzels in that caustic chemical?‚Äù\n\n  \nPeggy lifts up her face shield. Her eyes are kind. ‚ÄúLimmie, I would never do that to you. I promise, this will make the pretzels just like how Maya remembers them.‚Äù\n\n  \nTail flicking, Limmie takes the PPE from Peggy. ‚ÄúHow do I put this on?‚Äù\n\n  \n‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you, come here.‚Äù\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \n‚ÄúOh gosh Limmie, these are perfect! Where did you get them?‚Äù Maya‚Äôs eyes are squeezed shut in bliss as she chews the warm pretzels. ‚ÄúThey taste just like the ones Nana made!‚Äù\n\n  \n‚ÄúPeggy helped me make them. She showed me exactly what to do, but I did the work.‚Äù\n\n  \nMaya swallows and looks at Limmie, eyes wide. ‚ÄúYou made these? You made German Pretzels with the lye bath and everything?‚Äù\n\n  \nLimmie falls into Maya‚Äôs arms and snuggles down into her chest. ‚ÄúOf course I did. I had to wear some personal protective equipment, but Peggy showed me how to be careful and she explained we needed the lye to get it just right. I wanted to make something just for you that I knew you‚Äôd love.‚Äù\n\n  \nMaya squeezes Limmie and strokes her ears. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre wonderful hon. Thank you.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;",

In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today.

NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

Streamers of the light caught on the bundles of herbage the human had hung to dry from the support rafters and refracted through the silicate rich fibers across the far wall. Various old storage containers had been pressed into service as perches, shelving, and work surfaces. In one corner a vat large enough for  a grown Shatar male to climb into bubbled in a rather ominous manner.\n\nThird Cousin inched slightly closer to the open door as the cacophony of smells assaulted her antenna. She had come here to receive a gift given in a wholly friendly spirit. She was not about to offend a First Daughter, human or not, by refusing to accept the gift. Still, she wondered how the safety comity had allowed this combination of health hazards and fire risks to continue. Granted the place was beautiful, as long as you didn‚Äôt think too much about what you were looking at.\n\nA pile of dusty and torn tarps in one corner suddenly shifted and emitted a very mammalian grunt. Third Cousin tilted her head to the side and clicked her mandibles uneasily. She had no idea what the protocol was for greeting a First Daughter under these conditions. Even had they been on a hive world this meeting would have been unorthodox. Out here on the frontier, dealing with a new species it was pure chaos. Why a family would even let a First Daughter out of the gardens, let alone off planet was a mystery that Third Cousin couldn‚Äôt even begin to probe.\n\nFortunately the pile shifted even further and the thick, fleshy arm of First Daughter emerged and shoved the tarps away. The human rolled to the side almost like an Undulate and then arched her body in a series of almost normal looking stretches under the loose overalls she wore. Normal that is if you could ignore the ‚Äòtongue‚Äô that curled and flexed inside of her mouth. The membranous outer coverings of First Daughter‚Äôs eyes blinked open, revealing the beautiful twin rings of her hazel irises. Her near matching hair was pulled up in a tight coil under the hat she wore.\n\nAfter a few more stretches First Daughter caught a glimpse of Third Cousin in the mirror and spun around with a yelp.\n\n‚ÄúYo Cuz!‚Äù she called out. ‚ÄúHow long have you been watching me?‚Äù\n\nThird Cousin tilted her angular head to the side as she tried to understand the purpose of the question.\n\n‚ÄúSince I came through the door?‚Äù She offered.\n\nFirst Daughter stared at her a moment before bursting out laughing.\n\n‚ÄúNo matter,‚Äù the human said. ‚ÄúYou came for the discovery day gift right? It‚Äôs over here.‚Äù\n\nFirst Daughter turned and reached up for one of a stack of packets on the top shelf. There was a waxy disc inside pressed to mimic the hive matrix of one of the primitive insects of the human home-world. The disc was translucent and when the blue sunlight caught it the lipids refracted the light in a rainbow glow. Third Cousin clicked admiration.\n\n‚ÄúIt is beautiful,‚Äù she said, her frill flushing with delight.\n\n‚ÄúThank‚Äôs,‚Äù First Daughter replied her face flushing with pleasure. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs granny‚Äôs own anti-microbial mix. That stuff will keep your hands clean as a whistle. The silica herbs gave it a nice scent too-don‚Äôt open it!‚Äù\n\nThe final phrase was yelped out as Third Cousin was about to slip a talon under the seal of the clear packing. She froze and her antenna curled tight in embarrassment. What social custom had she offended, she wondered?\n\n‚ÄúYou have to wait two more weeks,‚Äù First Daughter hurriedly explained. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt cured yet. I would have left it on the shelf till discovery day proper but you are going to be out in the field for that week and I wanted you to have this before you left tomorrow.‚Äù\n\nThird Cousin relaxed at the reassurance and slipped the soap into her carry pack.\n\n‚ÄúThank you First Daughter,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúCould you tell me more about the curing process? Will the anti-microbial factor not be effective before that date?‚Äù\n\nFirst Daughter gave a bark of laughter as she pulled a coat out of the pile of tarps and put it over her coveralls.\n\n‚ÄúNah,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe germ killers‚Äôll work just fine. It‚Äôs just that the lye‚Äôll be active for awhile and that‚Äôll burn your skin right off it you touch it.‚Äù\n\nThird Cousin flicked her antenna in respectful understanding as they stepped out of the shed and First Daughter closed the door behind them. The Shatar figured that a compliment would be the best way to end the conversation.\n\n‚ÄúIt was very thoughtful of you to research Shatar membrane sensitivity,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI know how little humans have to fear from chemical damage.‚Äù\n\nFirst Daughter glanced at her with a puzzled expression on her face.\n\n‚ÄúWe might be pretty tough,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut that soap would do a dozy of a job on our skin as it is now. Lye‚Äôs sodium hydroxide ya know.‚Äù\n\nThird Cousin couldn‚Äôt keep her frill from darkening in horror but she masterfully held her antenna at a mostly loose curl. One did not insult the intelligence of a First Daughter. Fortunately First Daughter had turned her attention back to the main compound and was chatting away about what she was going to eat for dinner. Third Cousin made a mental note to report the clandestine lab to the safety comity. There was no way they knew what was going on.\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [‚ÄãBook Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes & Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&Ns=P_Series_Number&Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Walmart (Paperback)](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Humans-are-Weird-I-Have-the-Data-Paperback-9798588913683/974793262)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&fcsearchfield=Series&seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&fcshowpointsprice=no&fcmaxprice=5&fcminprice=0&id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# Please Leave Reviews on the Newest Book!\n\n***Hey!

An X-ray revealed numerous radio-dense, oblong, irregular bodies in both kidneys, the largest of which measured 10 mm x 8 mm x 6 mm. The patient was diagnosed with kidney stones. As the largest stone was impacted in the wall of the renal calyx and had likely caused a perforation, it was decided to remove it laparoscopically. The surgery revealed a large and mostly smooth stone, dark brownish-black in color. It was removed without incident and sent to the lab for examination. The perforation in the calyx was sutured.\n\nThere were no postoperative complications. However, the patient began complaining of malaise, muscle pain, and severe joint pain. She was running a fever of 101 F. She was empirically started on ceftriaxone for possible urinary tract or kidney infection.\n\nOn Day 2, she asked to speak with the physician in charge of her case (the author). She admitted to having undergone gene therapy at an unlicensed clinic. She had a family history of motor neuron disease of the ALS type which had affected her mother, one of her mother's two sisters, her maternal grandmother, and all of her maternal grandmother's three sisters. Symptoms generally began between ages 55 and 60, and included weakness and loss of coordination (starting in the legs and progressing upwards), painful spasticity, and eventually, global muscle wasting. Victims of the disease were ventilator-dependent by approximately 3 years after onset. The patient, her mother, and her aunt had all undergone genetic testing, which revealed a homozygous SOD1 mutation at position 113 (isoleucine to methionine). The mother committed suicide at age 59, after the onset of upper-limb symptoms. The aunt began showing symptoms at age 51 and died at age 55. The patient had the same mutation as both her mother and her aunt, and had written several magazine articles about living with the threat of a debilitating genetic disease.\n\nShe said that, as a result of these articles, she had been contacted by an unknown woman who said she ran a private gene therapy clinic. The woman would not identify herself, saying that she was not a licensed physician, and that she faced criminal charges if her clinic was discovered. However, she claimed an intimate knowledge of both genetic disease and gene therapy, and presented credentials to that effect. She invited the patient to visit her facility. \n\nDuring her visit, the woman showed the patient several rooms containing people with neuromuscular disorders. She was also introduced to a man in his 50s who claimed the woman had cured him of his ALS. She spoke to the man, and saw videos and documents regarding his treatment, and was convinced of the efficacy of the treatment. Over the course of three weeks, she underwent six injections of what the woman described as ‚Äúenzyme-bound DNA.‚Äù She suffered from flulike symptoms for approximately one week after the treatment, but when she was re-tested, her body load of 113(I‚ÜíM)-SOD1 had dropped from 100% to 3%, which she considered curative. She paid the woman a large sum of money (she refused to disclose the exact amount). Three weeks later, she developed the kidney pain and hematuria.\n\nRapid PCR showed evidence of infection with Varicella zoster. The patient confirmed that she had been infected with chickenpox as a child. She said she didn't believe the gene therapy had involved the use of live viruses.\n\nBy the end of Day 2, the lab had had an opportunity to examine the kidney stone in detail. Although it appeared on inspection to be a pure calcium oxalate stone, the calcium oxalate comprised only a thin layer on the stone's surface. The interior consisted of an extremely tough and somewhat malleable substance which was silvery, iridescent, and extremely opaque to X-rays. Mass spectrometry only showed evidence of ordinary biomolecules (primarily calcium oxalate, water, and uric acid). Because of concerns about a possible metal-accumulation disorder, the stone was subjected to further testing. X-ray diffraction showed an amorphous solid. It was theorized, in view of the patient's family history of genetic disease, that the material was some sort of refractory ceramic, coincidentally excreted as a result of metabolic disease. A comprehensive metabolic study was initiated.\n\nOn Day 5, the patient complained that the joint pains had become unbearable. She was started on low-dose morphine. X-rays of her right knee, left elbow, and right shoulder showed severe inflammatory arthritis with numerous small (< 2 mm) X-ray opaque bodies in the synovial spaces. Arthrocentesis revealed cloudy, leukocyte-rich synovial fluid containing numerous small round objects which were black and irregular. Washing with sodium hydroxide and sonication with detergents removed the black coating, revealing a silvery, iridescent material identical to that of the stone recovered from the kidney.\n\nBecause of concerns about metal toxicity, the patient was empirically started on chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA and penicillimine along with IV mineral replacement.\n\nIn order to assess the distributions of the patient's metal deposits, an MRI was considered. However, because of concerns that the deposits might be ferromagnetic, the patient was subjected to a pre-MRI metal scan, which she passed, albeit with a small margin of safety. Because of her worsening pain, she elected to go ahead with the MRI. However, when the field in the scanner reached 0.13 Tesla, the patient complained of a burning sensation in her body and extreme exacerbation of the joint pain. The scan was stopped immediately. Following the MRI, her arthritis and fever worsened, and she was listed as ineligible for future MRIs.\n\nOn Day 7, when her fever and pain had improved, a CT scan was performed. This revealed mild edema in almost all joints and severe edema in the joints of the lower extremities below the level of the knee. There were erosive plaques in both femurs. There were small X-ray-dense bodies in nearly all soft tissues (all measuring less than 1 mm). In addition, there were several large objects ( > 1 mm) in the kidneys, the peritoneum, and the liver. These objects caused significant starburst artifacts, making the CT scan difficult to interpret.\n\nAs the largest of these objects were concentrated in the liver (there were 35 objects between 1 mm and 5 mm), a liver biopsy was performed and six of them removed from the left lobe. They were coated with bile salts and clotted blood. Two were flash-frozen and stored. Two were sent to the hospital's lab, one untreated and one cleaned as described above. One treated object and one untreated object were also sent to the local university for examination by their departments of chemistry and physics.\n\nOn Day 9, the patient suddenly began complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. Her ECG showed Q waves in V1 and V2. An echocardiogram revealed a perforated tricuspid valve with significant regurgitation and a possible flail leaflet. The patient developed mild ST-segment depression and runs of atrial tachycardia. Repeat echocardiogram showed worsening of tricuspid regurgitation, sluggishness of the right atrium, and hypokinesis of the basal and septal regions of the right ventricle.\n\nThe patient's cardiac function worsened significantly in spite of inotropic support. She was sent to the OR for emergent valve repair. The repair was conducted by our chief of cardiothoracic surgery and involved a trans-atrial approach with cardiopulmonary bypass but without cardioplegic arrest. The right leaflet was found to be perforated in its center and torn at its junction with the annulus, with significant thrombosis and stiffness of both the affected and unaffected leaflets. Because of thrombosis and inflammation, all leaflets were excised. A small spheroidal object was recovered from the right ventricle and was found to be identical to the previous deposits. A prosthetic tissue valve was implanted and the surgery completed.\n\nThe patient recovered well from the surgery, and was transferred out of the cardiac ICU on Day 16. However, she complained of increasing pain in her groin, kidneys, legs, abdomen, back, and chest. X-rays showed several new deposits scattered throughout the pelvis and abdomen, and embedded in the walls of the large veins of the legs, the inferior vena cava, and the aorta. It was the opinion of our cardiothoracic surgeon that the object found in the right ventricle, which was (like all the other recovered objects) extremely dense, had physically struck the tricuspid valve and caused the perforation. Therefore, the objects in the major arteries were considered life-threatening. The patient was prepared for x-ray-guided removal of the aortic and caval deposits. The surgery was to be performed on hospital Day 20.\n\nOn Day 18, just after standing up, the patient complained of extremely severe pain centered in her groin and radiating to her lower back, her abdomen, and both legs. She rapidly developed tachycardia, hypotension, and mental confusion. Aortic rupture and valve dehiscence wereconsidered. An echocardiogram showed good function of the tricuspid prosthesis. An x-ray angiogram of the abdomen revealed two significant aortic bleeds: a large bleed at the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries, and a smaller bleed just above the level of the hepatic arteries. The patient went into hypovolemic shock and was sent for emergency surgery. The patient was placed under therapeutic hypothermia, cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated, the heart was arrested, and the aorta was cross-clamped to allow repair of the ruptures. The aorta was repaired with gelatin-sealed polyester prosthetics and strips of harvested pericardium. However, during the repair, numerous small dissections were noted along the length of the aorta, as well as significant aortic staining. The dissections were repaired with fibrin sealant and patching as necessary. The patient was warmed and weaned from bypass. Her heart began beating spontaneously, and her hemodynamic shock resolved. However, one hour postoperatively, the patient suddenly developed sinus tachycardia of 130 BPM with low QRS voltage and electrical alternans. Echocardiogram showed a pericardial effusion, and pericardiocentesis produced approximately 210 mL of blood. Angiography showed a 17-mm tear in the free wall of the right ventricle. The patient was rushed back to the OR. During placement of cardiopulmonary bypass cannulae, the patient went into ventricular fibrillation which was electrically cardioverted. The myocardial rupture was closed. Attempts were made to wean the patient from bypass, but she remained asystolic. She was maintained on ECMO for 10 hours, at which point she suddenly went into hypovolemic shock which was unresponsive to pressor or fluid support. She could not be resuscitated, and was pronounced dead.\n\nOn autopsy, numerous small metallic bodies were discovered embedded in the aortic wall. Larger ones were found in the liver, the calices of the kidneys, and the large muscles. A massive intraabdominal hemorrhage was discovered, originating from the site of the smaller aortic bleed. This was determined to be the cause of death.\n\nNo metabolic abnormalities had been found. There was no evidence of viral infection.\n\nThe university reported that they had performed several tests on the objects, but were unable to perform more, as one of their professors of chemistry had suddenly left the university and taken the samples with him. \n\nThey had determined that the objects were made of an unusual substance which they had not been able to identify and had not previously encountered. It produced no identifying signature on mass spectrometry, and they found the same isotropic x-ray diffraction pattern, even at extremely high energies. Gamma spectroscopy showed unusual excitations, but the noise level was too high for a meaningful analysis. Remarkably, they reported that the objects had a variable density of between 50 and 1,000 grams per cubic centimeter. There is no known or theorized chemical element with such a high density. The measurement was considered erroneous, but they were confirmed by three separate technicians using two separate sets of equipment. The university suspected deliberate tampering with results, but as the samples had been stolen, they were unable to confirm this.\n\nThe day of the patient's death, a man presented himself to the hospital, identifying himself as the patient's brother. He showed documentation to that effect, and became extremely angry when he learned that an autopsy had been performed. He said that he and the patient objected to autopsy on religious grounds, and demanded that the patient's remains be turned over to him, as well as any instruments or objects which had made contact with her blood. We were unable to comply with the latter request, and he demanded, under the threat of legal action, that the instruments and objects in question be destroyed and disposed of. After consultation with our legal staff, we complied with his wishes, and allowed the brother to observe while the instruments, bedding, and samples were incinerated.\n\nTwo weeks after the patient's death, a small gold ring was found in the corner of the patient's room. One of the shift nurses recalled seeing the patient wearing it. We attempted to contact the patient's brother, but the telephone number he had provided was out of service, and a courier reported that, when she took the ring to the address listed on his identification, that it was the address of a hardware store.\n\nThe patient's disease has not been identified.

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Here‚Äôs the run-down:\nIngredients:\n\n  ‚Ä¢  DMT-containing plant material ‚Äî you can use Mimosa hostilis, Mimosa pudica, Psychotria viridis, or other plant-sources of DMT\n ‚Ä¢   A nonpolar solvent ‚Äî such as naphtha\n    Distilled water\n    Sodium hydroxide (lye)\n    5% distilled white vinegar ‚Äî can also use ‚Ä¢muriatic acid\n\nEquipment:\n\n    Nitrile gloves\n    Safety goggles\n    A pipette or separation funnel‚Äî to remove the nonpolar layer that contains the DMT (separation funnels work great too)\n    Coffee filters\n    A few glass beakers or jars ‚Äî never use plastic or metal containers to perform these extractions\n    A refrigerator and freezer\n    A coffee grinder or blender\n\nThe Process: Simplified\n\n    Mix plant material with vinegar and water\n    Add sodium hydroxide to increase the pH\n    Add naphtha to separate the DMT portion\n    Place the solution in the fridge to separate the DMT\n    Filter and dry the freebase DMT powder\n\nStep-By-Step Process for Extracting DMT From Plants\n\nThe basic process of isolating DMT from plant sources is simple and can be done using chemicals that are readily accessible without the need for a lab license. There are many different options for the chemicals used, and more advanced methods of purification like short-path vacuum distillation can make the process more efficient but aren‚Äôt entirely necessary.\n\nThe following process outlines the simplest method of DMT extraction anybody can follow at home.\n\nThe most important point to remember here is that despite being readily available, the chemicals used in this process are very dangerous if used incorrectly:\n\n    Lye is caustic and can cause severe chemical burns to the eyes and skin ‚Äî wear gloves and goggles.\n    Naphtha and other solvents are highly flammable ‚Äî ensure the area is well-ventilated and away from sparks or open flames.\n    Some plants are toxic ‚Äî always ensure the raw plant material is sourced from a reputable source to avoid extracting the wrong species of plant.\n\nHere‚Äôs the step-by-step process for extracting DMT from plants ‚Äî the simple method:\nStep 1: Gently Heat the Plant Material in Water & Vinegar\n\nStarting with your dried plant material, grind it into a fine powder using a blender or coffee grinder.\n\nNext, slowly add 5% distilled white vinegar to the powdered herb (ratio 0.4 mL per gram of dried herb). Alternatively, you can use muriatic acid for this step.\n\nAdd near boiling distilled water (90¬∫C) at a ratio of 3.6 mL water to 1 gram of dried root powder.\n\nGently heat the solution for about 3 hours, stirring frequently. You can use a double boiler, hot plate, or slow cooker to achieve this. Keep the heat setting on low ‚Äî it shouldn‚Äôt be boiling.\nStep 2: Strain to Remove the Plant Material\n\nAfter a half-hour or so, you can strain the plant material out of the mixture with a cheesecloth or fine strainer. The liquid you‚Äôre left with is essentially a tincture of the starting herb material. It will be very dark and have a strong aroma.\nStep 3: Basify The Solution\n\nTo basify the solution, mix about 5 g of lye (sodium hydroxide) with 100 mL of distilled water. Test the pH to ensure it‚Äôs around 12 or 13. You know the pH is above 12 when it goes from a deep purple color to a dark black.\n\nAdd the solution to the extraction gradually ‚Äî it will darken and begin to heat up. Allow the mixture to sit for about 48 hours before moving on to the next step.\nStep 4: Filter & Defat The Solution\n\nThe defatting process involves ‚Äúwashing‚Äù the solution with a nonpolar solvent, such as naphtha (found at camping stores in the form of fuel or Zippo fluid).\n\nOnce you add the solvent, give the mixture a stir, a nonpolar phase will gradually start to float to the top of the liquid. Let the mixture sit for 24 hours to allow it to separate completely. Lightly mix the solution together by lightly shaking the jar every few hours. Don‚Äôt shake too vigorously, or the solution will emulsify and become much harder to separate.\n\nOver the course of a few hours, the DMT will diffuse from the bottom water layer to the top naphtha layer.\nStep 5: Separate the Top DMT-Containing Layer & Rechrystalize\n\nUsing a pipette, turkey baster, or separation funnel, separate the clear top layer from the dark bottom layer. The clear top layer is where the DMT is.\n\nPlace the solution in the fridge to cool. Chrystals will form at the bottom of the solution, which consists of nearly pure freebase DMT.\n\nYou can then pour this mixture through a coffee filter to separate the DMT chrystals from the naphtha. Allow the coffee filters to completely dry in a well-ventilated area to remove the naphtha.\nStep 6: Recrystallization & Further Purification\n\nThe product you have at this point can be smoked, but it‚Äôs a good idea to do separate recrystallization of your product to purify the extract further.\n\nThis is done by adding a small amount of naphtha to the powder and gently stirring until everything is dissolved. If it doesn‚Äôt dissolve, you may need to heat the solution gently using a double boiler. Be careful here because the naptha will start to evaporate at around 40¬∫C. Never use an open flame to heat the solution for any reason.\n\nNext, place the solution in the fridge for a few hours, then the freezer for a few more hours.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to allow the solution to cool gradually by cooling to room temperature, fridge temperature, and then freezer ‚Äî rather than just going to the freezer directly. You won‚Äôt get a good yield if you place the jar directly in the freezer.\n\nAfter a few hours, the DMT will form new crystals at the bottom of the jar, which will be purer than the first set of crystals you made in step 4.\n\nFilter the crystals from the naphtha with a coffee filter. Spread the powder out on a plate and allow it to dry entirely. Ensure good ventilation so the naphtha can be removed safely as it evaporates from the powder.\nHow Pure is the Final Extract?\n\nWhat you‚Äôre left with is freebase N,N,DMT, along with some other unknown compounds removed from the plant.\n\nThis method is a reliable way of producing high-concentrations of DMT, but without further lab purification techniques, it‚Äôs never going to be completely pure [1].\n\nThere are other compounds in the plant that will be extracted using the same process. Which compounds are isolated depends on the source of the raw plant material, solvents used, and other factors.",

SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 ü§î causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¬π. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.¬≤\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¬π n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"¬≤ Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease¬≥. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.‚Å¥  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp‚Åµ.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea‚Å∂.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¬π, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¬π.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.‚Å∑ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA‚Äôs approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¬π¬π \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¬π¬≤ It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¬π¬≥ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR‚Å∏, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.‚Åπ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¬π‚Å∞ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "**UPDATE**\nI got a lot of comments saying this is seborrheic dermatitis. **What I had was NOT Seborrheic dermatitis.** SB takes a long time to heal and almost never goes away. It is difficult to treat. What I had went away in ~6 shampoos and has never come back. It was a yeast infection, just as the dermatologist diagnosed. Just wanted to clarify.\n\n---\n\nIf you have dry flaky skin, and maybe some dry flaky scalp, you might actually have the yeast infection known as dandruff! The dermatologist examined my skin (dry and flaky, prone to breakouts) and scalp (slightly flaky, but not that bad: nothing I would have sought treatment for independently). She noted the extra flakes on my forehead (where my hair touches my skin) and in my nose creases, and the fact that no amount of moisturizing has made any difference for me, and prescribed a dandruff shampoo that I would also use as a facewash. Apparently dandruff is actually a type of yeast infection!\n\n**Background:**\n\nI've been a member of this subreddit for about a year, self-identified as having \"dry\" skin with some flakes. My skin generally feels dull and listless, and I struggle with little acne breakouts all the time.\n\nI started with the Beginner's Routine, and slowly added products (patch-testing, of course) until I had this routine:\n\nMorning:\n\n* Splash with water\n* Paula's Choice BHA (~2x a week, waiting 30 mins before proceeding))\n* Moisturizer CeraVe in the tub (sometimes)\n* Elta MD 46 facial sunscreen (everyday)\n\nEvening:\n\n* OCM w/ jojoba oil (most nights)\n* CeraVe foaming cleanser (other nights)\n* If I washed with CeraVe I would use St. Ives' AHA pads, waiting 30 mins before proceeding)\n* Moisturizer CeraVe in the tub\n* Petroleum jelly\n\nNo matter what my routine was, my skin really never changed: it was always dry-feeling, dull, listless, flaky, and prone to breakouts.\n\n\n**Now**:\n\nI've only used the shampoo once (she told me to wash my face with it too), but my skin already feels soft and supple instead of dry and flaky - it feels... almost wet and sticky to me now, but in a good way. Like how the rest of my skin feels - no longer grainy, dry and flaky!\n\nWe'll see how it goes long-term, but thought I'd mention the concept of dandruff as yeast infection for others!\n\n**EDIT:**\nThe active ingredient in the shampoo is 2% ketoconazole. The prescription version of the shampoo cost $7 (it's the generic version, I don't think the price had anything to do with my not-so-great insurance). It's called \"Perrigo\". Here's the full ingredient list:\n\n* ketoconazole 2%\n* coconut fatty acid diethanolamide\n* disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n* FD & C Red No. 40\n* hydrochloric acid\n* imidurea\n* laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen\n* PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate\n* purified water\n* sodium chloride \n* sodium hydroxide\n* sodium lauryl ether sulfate",

It was constantly red, inflamed, itchy, and the mild flaky spots had taken over my entire face. I finally went to see a dermatologist and she diagnosed me with sebhorreic dermatitis and informed me that all of the oil and petroleum I had been smothering on my face every night was actually making my condition worse.

    "body": "The Oreo ones and White Chocolate Salted Peanut stood out as the winners, while the other bars were mostly average or slightly above average. These bars were again ranked according to taste and texture. While the bars were at least two months from their expiration dates, most of the syrup layers were dried up and some coatings were crumbly. I‚Äôve been having these shipped to the province so that could be a factor. I ordered them from Shopee for P130.00 each after discounts. \n\nTheir calories range from 203 (Caramel Chaos) to 242 (Salted Peanut) - higher than Quest‚Äôs, and on average, higher than Mars‚Äô. Each bar has around 20g of protein, low fiber content, and a relatively high amount of sugar alcohols. A couple of these bars were sweet enough to cause some irritation in my throat. I‚Äôve included macros and ingredients for a few bars at the end.\n\n**[9.0] White Chocolate Salted Peanut** - pleasant base that was dense yet soft, thick white chocolate coating, peanut bits that did really well for the texture, caramel syrup. the base had a sort of white chocolate and peanut (but not peanut butter) flavor. on the sweeter side, overall a very enjoyable bar. taste and texture were similar to Snickers White Chocolate\n\n**[9.0] Oreo White** - rich Oreo base, vanilla creme layer, Oreo pieces, thick white chocolate coating. flavor was on point, especially liked the vanilla creme layer that was reminiscent of powdered sugar. Oreo pieces had some crunch to them. dense and a little chewy.\n\n**[8.5] Oreo** - similar to Oreo White above, but with a milk chocolate coating (more delicious vs other Grenade bars) that was unfortunately crumbly. Oreo pieces were not crunchy and the base was a little *too* chewy, hence the lower rating\n\n**[7.0] Fudged Up** - fudge base, milk chocolate coating, caramel (?) syrup, a few chocolate chips (skimped). typical fudge / brownie protein bar flavor, i like that it wasn't too sweet or rich. noticeable protein powder smell opening the wrapper but not in taste. texture was better after i let half sit in room temp\n\n**[6.5] Dark Chocolate Raspberry** - chocolate / raspberry base, dark chocolate coating, chocolate bits, dried up raspberry caramel syrup. a little tart, i liked the unique flavor on this one. would have ranked higher but the texture was dry and crumbly.\n\n**[6.5] Caramel Chaos** -  subtle caramel base, caramel syrup, crispy toppings, milk chocolate coating. standard caramel flavor that was decent, though base was a little chalky. \n\n**[6.0] Choco Chip Salted Caramel** - dense yet soft chocolate base, milk chocolate coating, chocolate chips, and caramel syrup that was almost non-existent along with the salted caramel flavor. maybe it‚Äôs my taste buds? rich and sweet that got too sweet finishing the bar which made my throat kind of itchy. first Grenade bar I tried and this was also the first time I experienced this sensation in my throat. initially a [7.0]\n\n**[6.0] White Chocolate Cookie** - chalky base, caramel (?) syrup, cookie bits, white chocolate coating. hints of vanilla protein powder. got sweeter finishing the bar that felt like my throat was about to be irritated again. bar was alright, nothing that stood out.\n\n**[5.5] Birthday Cake** - vanilla (?) base, sprinkles, white chocolate coating, dried up vanilla creme layer. taste was a miss, lacking flavor compared to Quest's Birthday Cake. wasn't especially sweet but I had that itchy sensation in my throat again, similar to the first Grenade bar I had.\n\n**[4.5] Jaffa Quake** - chocolate / orange base, choco crisps, milk chocolate coating, orange caramel syrup. not a fan of the chocolate and orange combo so my expectations were already low. feels like one of things that you either love or hate. more unpleasant closer to finishing the bar, texture was proper though. initially a [5.5]\n\nMy current favorites from the protein bars I‚Äôve covered are Quest S‚Äômores and Double Chocolate Chunk, the flavoured Snickers Hi Protein bars, and Grenade‚Äôs Oreo, Oreo White, and White Chocolate Salted Peanut. Thank you u/SweetDestination23 for the Grenade protein bar recommendation. \n\nMacros for a few bars:\n\nCaramel Chaos - 203 kcal 7F 21P 21C (2g sugar, 19g polyols)\n\nGrenade Oreo - 233 kcal 10F 21P 20C (1g sugar, 17g polyols)\n\nSalted Peanut - 242 kcal 12F 20P 19C (2g sugar, 17g polyols)\n\nCaramel Chaos ingredients:\nProtein Blend (Milk Protein, Calcium Caseinate (Milk), Whey Protein (Milk)), Milk Chocolate with Sweetener (20%) (Sweetener: Maltitol; Cocoa Butter, Whole Milk Powder, Cocoa Mass, Emulsifier: Soy Lecithin; Natural Flavouring), Sweeteners: Maltitol, Sucralose; Bovine Collagen Hydrolysate, Humectant: Glycerol; Bulking Agent: Polydextrose; Soy Protein, Sunflower Oil, Soy Crisp (Soy Protein, Tapioca Starch, Salt), Flavourings, Potassium Chloride, Emulsifier: Soy Lecithin\n\nGrenade Oreo ingredients:\nProtein Blend (Calcium Caseinate (Milk), Whey Protein Isolate (Milk)), Milk Chocolate with Sweetener (20%) (Sweetener: Maltitol; Cocoa Butter, Whole Milk Powder, Cocoa Mass, Emulsifier: Soy Lecithin; Natural Flavouring), Bovine Collagen Hydrolysate, Humectant: Glycerol; Sweeteners: Maltitol, Sucralose; Palm Oil, Water, Fat- reduced Cocoa Powder (3%), Wheat Flour, Wheat Starch, Rapeseed Oil, Bulking Agent: Polydextrose; Sea Salt, Emulsifier: Soy Lecithin; Raising Agents: Ammonium Carbonates, Sodium Carbonates; Acidity Regulator: Sodium Hydroxide; Flavouring\n\nWhite Chocolate Salted Peanut ingredients:\nWhite Chocolate with Sweetener (31%) (Sweetener: Maltitol; Cocoa Butter, Whole Milk Powder, Emulsifier: Lecithins (Soy); Natural Flavouring), Protein Blend (Calcium Caseinate (Milk), Whey Protein Isolate (Milk)), Humectant: Glycerol; Bovine Collagen Hydrolysate, Roasted Peanut Pieces (7%), Water, Dietary Fibre: Polydextrose; Palm Fat, Peanut Paste (2.3%), Flavouring, Salt, Sweetener: Sucralose.\n",

This was a decade ago and it still gets me riled.\n\nI was working in the same lab I had worked in the previous summer. My PI was mostly a teaching professor so he had no grad students and just two undergrad. He tasked me with teaching my new lab mate James our SOPs. Problem was, James believed he knew better than I did how to do our research because he had dangling genitals and I did not. Some notable issues:\n\n1. Starting our reaction required cutting Mg ribbon into very small pieces. James said this was a \"waste of time\" and roughly jacked up the Mg and then whined when the first step of the reaction took 5 hours instead of one. Doubled down and blamed me for \"letting him do the setup\". üôÑ\n\n2. We would rinse our cleaned glassware with acetone the evening before a reaction and then flame dry it in a separate area before placing in a dessicator to keep as much water out without resorting to Schlink (sp?) lines. James left without doing his dishes so he rinsed with acetone right before flame drying right next to the acetone bottle. The inevitable happened and he screeched and flapped his hands like a little bitch until I placed a large beaker over the flaming container to smother the fire. He blamed me for not cleaning his glassware the night before and being in the bathroom when he moved the Bunsen burner out of the designated area. \n\n3. I showed James multiple times that the needle should be supported when puncturing the GCMS membrane, otherwise it would break. Every time he broke it, he would forge my name on the log and then leave the broken needle next to the machine. Halfway through the summer, they added an electronic sign on to the machine and I could prove I was not the asshole who broke things and left them for other people to clean up. \n\n \nI was so glad when James had to go back to Vermont when the school year started back up.\n\n\nAnd finally an embarrassing story involving me lest I give the impression I can do no wrong. During my first summer of research, I started to feel really lightheaded when working up one of our products. I went to tell my PI that I thought I needed to go home. He silently walked over to my lab bench and put the cap back on the bottle of diethyl either. ü§¶ I'm a goddamn idiot who was old school  anesthetizing herself.",

        "body": "Most might have made a wrong assumption:  That there is a deposit on the glass.  A possibility is that the glass has weathered -- that is that some of the glass as dissolved and left a rough surface.  This bottle is probably made out of a common sodium lime glass.  These glasses are not very resistant to water.  Borosilicate glass (like Pyrex) is typically much more resistant to weathering.\n\nBecause it might not be a residue, it might not cause a problem in your next batch of wine -- although its surface area has probably been increased, which would make it for catalytic.\n\nThe strong KOH solutions might make it look better because it might etch the surface more flatly.  It might not reduce its catalytic activity.  It might even make the surface even more rough.\n\nA rinse with hydrofluoric acid might make it better.  This is very dangerous.  Before I knew better, as an undergraduate, I got a few drops on my skin.  If you don't rinse it off quickly, you don't notice anything for about a hour, then it burns very badly.  HF in contact with larger area of skin, can be fatal if not rinsed off quickly.  I am a chemist at a glass company, so I have some knowledge in these areas.  (Not a full expert.)  Over a period of 5 decades, we have had at least 4 fatalities due to hydrofluoric acid.  HF diffuses though the skin, ties up the calcium in your blood stream, causing the heart to stop.\n\n(Some say a mixture of hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids is a better polishing solution.  You need to be even more careful with that.  The wrong mixture can give off HF vapors which can be fatal more quickly.)\n\nI am not sure if I should have even said all of this because of the dangers.  KOH is hard on the skin.  It makes the skin feel slippery because it converts the fats on your skin to soap.  If you clean them off quickly, both KOH and HF do less damage.  But you better know what you are doing.",

Most products that claim to mend split ends don‚Äôt have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here‚Äôs the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That‚Äôs fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there‚Äôs a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don‚Äôt let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don‚Äôt let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there‚Äôs some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can‚Äôt tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "# Preface:\n\nThis will be a long guide, so lets get some things out of the way:\n\n* This is a guide to Seablock. The mod can be found on the mod page [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SeaBlock), a 'pack' mod can be found [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SeaBlockMetaPack). For the best experience it is **highly** recommended to download it directly as a zip pack with all the correct mods from the homepage [here](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=93136).\n* The basis of Seablock is a modified Bob & Angel pack, so expect around 10x the amount of items, recipes, and buildings as you would in base Factorio. The key difference between a regular B&A playthough and Seablock being that there are no ore patches and even land itself is at a premium - you start on a single block of land that you must expand. Nearly everything comes from water, and that includes the ores. On the positive note, there is very little interaction with biters, exclusively in the form of worms that you must snipe from afar and no actual nests. This make the game more like peaceful mode, where the only worry you have is to expand the factory.\n* Any talk of tiers will most often be about recipe tiers, not building tiers. For example T1 and T2 green algae is for algae from water recipe and algae from mineralized water and carbon dioxide recipe; NOT! about T1 algae farm building and T2 algae farm building.\n* I will specifically not be giving any blueprints or actual in-game screenshots so as to allow for a more interesting game. What I will be providing is a general flow through the technology tree that I recommend, along with some recipe charts that you can use as a basis for your builds.\n* The images were getting a bit big, so I downscaled them so as to keep reddit from crashing (too much). To get the full images plus the original graph file go [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2zJKZKakjxmW5HhXsJsnZyiZbV7Vd7G/view?usp=sharing). You can either have them as an image collection to use as a guide during play, or open up the graph and edit the flow values so as to better design your factory. The graph was made in [Foreman 2.0](https://github.com/DanielKote/Foreman2) (which is what I spent the last 2 months working on instead of doing a seablock run as I originally planned). The app is still in its development phase, so there may (and are) be bugs in it (not of the biter variety - I removed those quite early on).\n\n# First steps\n\nManaging to crash-land on a single block of land takes some skill, diving for the wreckage of your spaceship to recover at least some materials before depositing them on a rock and promptly forgetting how to swim takes a bit more. Or did you know how to swim in the first place? Perhaps it was the adrenaline...\n\nWell - time to get started. Grab the extra resources from the rock, place some land around you, attach some windmills, and think to yourself - what now?\n\n**Step 0**: if you are still not at green science and arent hand-crafting something important (such as buildings), queue up a few hundred cellulose fiber forage crafts. These are your fuel, and until you get some stable power generation going you will effectively be the fuel provider for your factory. If you feel like setting 1k of these to craft and just AFKing until thats done... thats all up to you.\n\nIn terms of starting power, place **all** your windmills! these are basically free power without worrying about providing fuel, so until you are into green science and have automated (with a sufficient safety margin) charcoal power dont even think about removing them.\n\n**Start by following the science tutorial**. It should be pretty simple - open up the research tree and see that your only option is to get your hands on some crushed stiratite. This is done simply by building 1 electrolyser, 2 flare stacks (to get rid of oxygen and hydrogen), 1 water pump, 1 ore crusher, 1 liquefier and 1 crystallizer. Set your electrolyser to dirty water electrolysis, connect the flare stacks to the outputs, water pump to the input, get some power, and watch your first slag be produced.\n\nYou have enough materials to set up 4 electrolysers right from the start, so once you know how to connect your 1st electrolyser just add in 3 more (do remember to connect the outputs together so you can use just the 2 flare stacks for all 4 electrolysers). This should speed things up for the first few hours  of seablock which can get a bit repetitive (as you wait for ores to accumulate).\n\nSlag is one of those pre-pre-ore ores - you start from it (or from crystals, we will get to that), convert it to the 6 pre-ores (stiratite is one of them), which can later be converted to actual ores (such as iron), which will be converted into various metals.\n\nFor now, drop your slag into a crusher to convert it to crushed stone, then put down a liquefier (with water input) and set it to produce mineralized water, which will go into the crystallizer to generate pre-ores like stiratite. Once you get a few of those, you can crush them in the crusher and get your first tech researched!\n\nStep 2 for research (brown algae) is super quick now, as you can just craft an algae farm, connect water, set T1 green algae generation, and you are done.\n\nStep 3... your base T1 (brown) circuits. Not as difficult as it may seem at first - just take it one step at a time. Iron and copper can now be smelted from crushed saphirite and stiratite (the generation of which you have already accomplished), copper coils is just a single step away from copper, and wooden boards can be made through the T1 paper recipe (brown algae => alginic acid => cellulose pulp (with added cellulose fiber) => paper => wooden boards). We will get to full circuit building later on, so if you skip ahead you will find some graphs for it.\n\nFinally Step 4 will require you to build your first lab - once again, take it step by step. Pretty standard iron + copper conversions, just got to have some T1 circuits, which you should have on hand anyway.\n\nAnd finally we get to red science! What to do? Tell you what - lets make a list:\n\n1. get some ores.\n2. get some science.\n3. make a rocket.\n\nFor now, lets focus on the first 2.\n\n# Ore generation\n\n[Direct smelting \\(left\\), sorting \\(middle\\), stiratite only sorting \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/6wulhw2i67x71.png?width=3712&format=png&auto=webp&s=542aab62387a08d9b6326cc52406ac5439a9913c)\n\nYour first ore generation methods will be extremely inefficient, and as such it is highly recommended to get away from them as soon as possible. Dont bother with building a large production facility until you are well into green science territory, and dont go full mega scale until late-game unless you know what you are doing.\n\nThe absolutely first ore generation will be through mineralized water, and as much of the metal production as you can should go towards research. From the three charts above you can see that direct smelting of stiratite and saphirite is the way to go. Sorting them to iron and copper ores will actually produce LESS plates, so should be avoided. The only reason to sort at this stage of the game would be to sort stiratite in order to get just a tiny bit more iron production, since copper isnt quite useful in the early game and you will likely stockpile quite a bit.\n\n**NOTE:** crushers -> you will quite early on be able to upgrade to electrical crushers (instead of burner ones). Make that upgrade and dont look back. I set up the graphs to show how much of your hand-crafting time (30%) will be spent making cellulose fiber for fuel in the beginning (so yea - if you arent crafting anything, craft cellulose fiber), but the moment you can switch to electrical you should.\n\n**NOTE:** pipe options -> you really only have 2; copper pipes or stone pipes. Copper pipes are popular due to the stockpiles of copper you tend to get in the beginning, while stone pipes (my personal preference) are more efficient. In fact based on slag used, stone pipes come out to be around 5x cheaper than copper pipes.\n\n# Advanced Ore generation\n\n[First sulfur \\(1\\), T1 electrolyser mineral sludge \\(2\\), T2 electrolyser mineral sludge \\(3\\), geode mineral sludge \\(4\\).](https://preview.redd.it/gt8i5qjx67x71.png?width=5536&format=png&auto=webp&s=255f5ccdfeddafb8b539563c9c9bd419eb34cb09)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will start by getting some sulfur through washing (see science below for progression), after which your ore production will be sulfur positive as long as you stick to coal filters and crush all geodes (4). As soon as you have the science (and buildings) for it, you should switch from mineralized water (1) to mineral sludge (2), as it will double your production. Then once you have T2 unlocked (green science, see progression), you should switch to the electrode based mineral sludge production (3). This will once again double your production (per electrolyser).\n\n**Key note** here: initial power will most likely depend on mineralized water, which you will struggle with in red science due to having to balance between slag that goes towards metal plates, or slag that goes towards mineralized water (for power). Once you get your first green science, that will be a thing of the past due to excess production of mineralized sludge. As you can see from the chart 4 electrolysers produce enough mineralized water to run almost 6 T2 green algae plants (see power), which produce enough power to power 16 electrolysers + all the extra buildings with some left over.\n\n**Geodes:** Once you are well into green science geodes becomes available and is (at least personally) the preferred way of generating mineral sludge. It is also quite easy to set up generation of crystal sludge which is necessary for later ore production, so at least some geode processing is necessary no matter what. There are many different ways to set this up, though care must be taken to ensure the design can in fact handle the 6 (random) geode outputs of the washing process. My personal recommendation would be to have long inserters & more inserters researched, which would enable you to fit 5 or 6 washing plants around a single warehouse, with enough space to put 6 ore crushers and 2 liquifiers around it as well. With careful placement of inserters you can have all the geodes from washing plants go into the warehouse, out to the crushers, back to the warehouse, and out to the liquefiers without a single belt being necessary. Alternatively you can do the same with 2 warehouses (washing plants into warehouse 1, inserters move from warehouse 1 to warehouse 2, and then the crushers + liquefiers are positioned around warehouse 2).\n\n**Direct ore sorting:** Direct ore sorting is the best (and some say only) option for metallic ore production once past the early stage of seablock. Due to not having to juggle multiple outputs as you would with regular sorting, the minor 'waste' of materials to make catalysts is just not worth thinking about (besides planning where to get said extra materials). Once geodes have been conquered, catalysts (both mineral and crystal) can be made. In the green science phase you are mostly interested in mineral catalysts (as those are necessary to directly sort for the base 4 metals - namely iron, copper, tin and lead), though once aluminum becomes a necessity you will need to produce crystal catalysts. Filtering for crystal slurry requires purified water instead of mineralized, so you will need to place extra hydro plants plants and expect more crushed stone production. Other than that, its quite similar to mineralized sludge filtering you would already be doing.\n\n**Chunks (washing):** aluminum (and higher tier metals) start to require further processing of base ores, such as using flotation cells to turn them from crushed ores to chunks. This produces geodes (though unfortunately not enough to produce the required crystal catalysts) which can be belted back to the geode processing facilities, along with waste water that can be filtered or just voided (for now). The recommendation is to filter them - its really not that difficult (just throw in a hydro plant to process the waste water, use/void the mineralized water/purified water/salt water, and store the resulting items in a chest).\n\n# Science\n\n[Basic red science \\(left\\), and green science \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1bpz0s86a7x71.png?width=1744&format=png&auto=webp&s=9935862ceb891f2e32500b0680a0af637a2ae7a9)\n\nThis isnt pie baking, so your basic red science is rather simple. three assemblers (or 1 player), some iron and copper plates, and we are done. Your goal at this stage is to get some proper power, upgrade ore production, and reach green science (in roughly that order). You can ignore belts for now as your first few hours will likely involve alot of hand-feeding (hint: get even distribution mod). The technology order will look something like this:\n\n1. Automation (electrical ore crushers are very nice, and assemblers are vital in factorio)\n2. Wood processing 2 (any bonuses on fuel are good)\n3. Green algae processing (this is what we were looking for! **Milestone!**)\n4. Washing, Basic chemistry, sulfur processing (you can get your first sulfur prepped at this point)\n5. Fluid control, water treatment, slag processing (this is your actual ore generation. Still just the start, but already 2x better than what you have right now. **Milestone!**)\n6. Fluid control, steel, mechanical refining, coal processing, basic solder casting, electronics, basic logistics, logistics, long inserters (QoL), near inserters (QoL), electrochemics lab, single-use ATMOS set (green science... **Milestone!**)\n7. Basic chemistry 2 (fast dirty water electrolysis means 2x slag production from your electrolysers, AND enough mineralized water production for T2 green algae without having to take slag away from your ore production. **Milestone!**)\n8. After this? you can aim towards geodes, push forward in metallurgy, or expand your factory to at least 20 electrolysers. All up to you!\n\nGreen science (step 7 and above) requires a bit more than red science, including all 4 base metals and the T1 circuits. Mechanical refining (step 6) would have given you the recipes to make the metal plates, and you have already learned to make T1 circuits.\n\n**HINT:** Once you have warehouses (or silos) researched (a bit of a side project in terms of technology), you will be able to set up some really compact direct insertion assembling chains where you can drop the base metals into the silo, and the ring of assemblers around it will pick what they need, craft the intermediates, and pass them on to the next assembler (that uses said intermediate), with the final product being dropped back in the silo. This leads to a compact 0 belt design which works perfectly for those first few hours.\n\n# Power Generation\n\n[T1 green algae to charcoal \\(left\\) and T2 green algae to charcoal \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/sxbtslc9a7x71.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d7f91f8d5b6f2cc0f3339cec6b01ccb7b566740)\n\nIn the beginning, your only power options are 1: the windmills, and 2: foraging for cellulose fiber. You should place all your windmills, and always be foraging for cellulose fiber. Your first few assembler machines can be used to refine the fiber into wood pellets, which can be burned to charcoal as soon as you have researched wood processing 2 (aka: quite early). The only time your buildings should be burning cellulose is in the beginning when you dont have a crafting machine to refine the fiber into pellets (dont bother refining it by hand - you get more energy per second just hand-crafting the fiber).\n\nNow - on to actual fuel production that doesnt involve hand crafting: green algae. You have 2 options:\n\n1. Tier 1 green algae (with brown algae byproducts)\n2. Tier 2 green algae (without brown algae byproducts, but with mineralized water requirement)\n\nInterestingly enough both require roughly the same amount of power, though this includes the 3 electrolysers for crushed stone in case of T2. Once you move into green science and basic chemistry 2 and start producing mineralized water as a byproduct, T2 becomes the uncontested winner (at least within the algae power).\n\nPersonally, I wait a bit and go straight into T2 green algae. It just makes things easier. Plus the fact that T2 green algae requires \\~3x less algae plants (which are huge), means that you spend less time crafting more landfill and more time progressing through the tech tree.\n\nI try to aim for 4 - 6 T2 algae plants for the power generation. This requires 4-6 boilers & 8-12 steam engines, and is enough to power 12-16 electrolysers with necessary overhead.\n\n**NOTE:** in terms of storage and transportation, I recommend storing your fuel and transporting it in wooden blocks (and burning them to charcoal on site). This just makes sense as 1 wooden brick makes 5 charcoal, so you require 5x as much space and belt speed to store/transfer the same amount of fuel power.\n\n# Power Generation (charcoal processing)\n\n[Power production from a single T2 green algae production \\(in T1 algae farm\\)](https://preview.redd.it/uqq3edmaa7x71.png?width=1936&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be0f32bec3f8b59217545bb4ad02618c64f87e4)\n\nJust to clarify on the power production side of things: Everything here starts from the basis of '1 T2 green algae farm' to see how much power is produced (keep in mind that some power is necessary for the assembling machines, but it is typically 0.1MW/assembler).\n\n1. Using the cellulose fiber directly produces 1.26MW of power\n2. Converting to wooden pellets produces 1.71MW of power\n3. Burning to charcoal produces 2.07MW of power\n4. Converting to charcoal pellets produces 2.43MW of power\n5. Processing to solid fuel with hydrogen produces 6.12MW of power (keep in mind that it requires 4.5 electrolysis T2 to keep up with 1 T2 green algae farm, though this does mean that with 20 electrolysers you can get 14.8MW of extra power just from NOT voiding your hydrogen)\n\n**NOTE:** In case you were wondering about the different tiers of boilers & steam engines: you dont actually get more power by using higher tiers, you just require less boilers / steam engines in order to get the same amount of power. So in the end you will still consume the same amount of fuel, just in a smaller footprint.\n\n# Landfill options\n\n[Electrolysers \\(left\\), Washing \\(middle\\), Geodes \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ho3usoefa7x71.png?width=3112&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ae9d911af4e67349a77a079b83f767ee20fd15)\n\nIn the beginning your only option for more landfill is to divert some of the slag away from the ores and into producing landfill. Keep in mind that you end up with 0.2 landfill per second from 4 electrolisers, which is enough to make 0.12 metal plates through mineralized water or 0.24 metal plates from slag slurry. So if you require 1k landfill to expand, that is roughly 270 to 530 red science packs worth of research that you could have done instead. It is for this reason that I recommend expanding only after you have a stable initial base + alternate landfill options available (aka: once you are in green science).\n\nWashing becomes available rather early on, and is much better energy wise (each washing plant requires 1/3 the power that an electrolyser does), while being roughly comparable in terms of space. It should also be relatively simple to set up a few lines of 5 plants with a clarifier shared between every 2 lines and a dedicated landfill assembler per line. Personally I recommend getting at least 4 lines set up somewhere, and just leaving them running. Landfill is something you will be needing more of for quite a while.\n\nFinally you can produce quite insane quantities of landfill once you get to geodes by just converting all crushed stone to landfill and just stockpiling the crystal dust in a warehouse (shooting it once its full), though to be honest just going with washing is a simpler alternative, that although being 2x as slow (based on similar number of buildings & power), doesnt require convoluted planning to handle 6 different outputs as geodes does.\n\n# Circuits\n\n[T1 circuits \\(left\\) and T2 circuits \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/x4mvgfwga7x71.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=7290f877410fb59a91ed81b59060359975ac77bc)\n\nThe basic T1 circuits are so simple that you are required to make them prior to even getting to red science. Still, the crafting chart can be found above. Note that once growing wood is an option transferring to the wood -> wooden board process (and abandoning algae along with any paper recipes) is the superior approach.\n\nThe T2 circuits however up the difficulty by requiring you to have all 4 base metals, along with the T1 circuits. On the positive note however is that you dont really need all that many green circuits until you get further into green science as green science itself only requires basic T1 circuits; so your real sink for T2 circuits is likely to be the various newly researched buildings that you wish to build (filter inserters, T2 assemblers, most T2 buildings).\n\nIf you havent already researched electronic assembly machines, it would be a good idea to do so prior to planning your T2 circuits design as 2x2 sized assemblers are much better to work with that 3x3 size.\n\n**NOTE:** Personally I recommend building just a very temporary T1 / T2 circuits factory to make a few stacks of T1/T2 circuits before getting rid of it. Once you have metallurgy researched further you will have much better options for solder along with the other metals (both plates and cables), so once you have T2 metallurgy for iron, copper and tin (along with T1 solder), then you can plan for a more long-term circuits factory.\n\n# Metallurgy (Red science)\n\n[direct smelting \\(1\\), single sorting \\(2\\), T1 metallurgy \\(3\\), iron-only production \\(4\\)](https://preview.redd.it/sw8pca9ja7x71.png?width=3760&format=png&auto=webp&s=725b14cd2c0c82f67a04f84a22b8a37d265295e3)\n\nAt the very start you will not have many options. As talked about before, there is no point in sorting ores when you are first starting out, with the only 'if-you-must' option being to sort the stiratite so as to get more iron. Once you get to mineral sludge, you get access to a few options.\n\n1. Continue direct smelting. There is nothing particularly wrong with this approach, though you do start loosing out on plates/sec due to the ability to better recycle slag (directly to mineral sludge instead of crushing it for mineralized water).\n2. Begin sorting. Due to the extremely low throughput you can get by with just a single sorter that you manually reconfigure whenever you need a specific type of ore. A single sorter can easily handle 12 electrolysis T1 (or 6 electrolysis T2), so until you get a bit of expansion going you should be alright.\n3. Research into metallurgy T1, and start upon the molten path. This nets you around 40% more plates, and as a bonus doesnt require as much space as you might fear due to the blast furnace & induction furnace being able to handle quite large loads before you need more than 1 (20 electrolysis T2 can still be handled). You just need to add a couple more casting machines (which are small enough that you can easily fit 2 per furnace).\n4. As a final option provided here, you can make use of the ferrous mixing in order to get a full iron output without any copper. Even though it requires three different base ores, you can actually make do with just a single one as long as you are willing to manually change between the three to balance them out (not too bad in the beginning when you are more or less in the the 'pre-automation' zone where any free resources should be spent on tech rather than quality of life).\n\n# Metallurgy (steel)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5tjfuqka7x71.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e409e6daaf317fa6ab8f051b9a6da6524e234a1\n\nMaking steel during the red science phase is something that should be avoided at all costs. The amount of ore required to make a single plate of steel is 2x as much as even the minimal metallurgical process, which is available during the green science phase. A slight step up to T2 iron metallurgy decreases the cost by 1.5x more (for a total of 3x efficiency). Any further upgrades are locked behind blue science though.\n\n# Metallurgy (green science)\n\n[3x iron \\(1\\), 3x copper \\(2\\), 3x tin \\(3\\), 3x lead \\(4\\), 2x tinned wire \\(5\\), 3x solder \\(6\\), 1x aluminum \\(7\\), 1x silicon \\(8\\), 1x silver \\(9\\)](https://preview.redd.it/pesmcl21hnx71.png?width=7096&format=png&auto=webp&s=adcf113fffcc2a601299681b5f8da4c176620c4f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce in green science, your options for metallurgy and getting more for less finally opens up. While T3 is locked far away, T2 for the base 4 metals is rather simple and with little complications. In most cases T1 will offer 33% boost over non-metallurgy alternatives (if any), T2 will offer 50% bonus production, with T3 offering another 50%. Coils add an extra boost as long as you use coolant, but the real reason to use coils over direct casting is the extra productivity modules you can fit in the process. Since green science offers neither coolant nor modules, using coils is not necessary in most cases (#5 being the exception).\n\nLets go over each metallurgy group individually:\n\n1. Iron, as the most basic metal is the simplest. As with most of the others it is recommended to use T1 metallurgy when you have resources available to craft your first metallurgy buildings, and enough space available to place them.\n2. Copper is much like iron, though it does have an additional oxygen requirement at T2. Electrolysers produce enough extra oxygen that this isnt a problem.\n3. Tin is the first metal that cant be directly smelted and must be processed through metallurgy (all the others are much the same). Other than that, it is basically identical to iron.\n4. Lead is your first true byproduct producing metallurgy process with its sulfur dioxide gas production. This could be converted to sulfuric acid, but due to us getting enough sulfur through the base ore production we can easily just void it in a flare stack and ignore it.\n5. Tinned copper wire. This is one of the largest savings by shifting to metallurgy (percent wise - you will likely save more on the slight increase due to iron than here simply due to the amount of iron you will require), and is the only use of the strand casting machine prior to blue science (well, you can make regular copper wire, but it doesnt grant any efficiency bonus, so why bother). As you can see using strand casting will increase the efficiency by 3.6x! That is huge! This is reason #1 why you should hold off on bulk circuit production until metallurgy.\n6. Solder. This is the second reason to hold off on circuit production. Shifting to molten solder is a 1.5x boost, while switching to a full molten solder from ingots (instead of plates) is a 3x (overall) boost while being smaller and simpler (one of the rare few cases of this in seablock).\n7. Aluminum. Assuming you have started direct sorting for metallic ores, this would be the first need for crystal catalysts along with the chunking of the base ores. The actual metallurgy isnt anything too complicated, though it does require sodium hydroxide which is relatively easy to get. You can either use a desalination plant or the standard hydro plant to get the necessary salt water  for the electrolysers, and just void the resultant gases.\n8. Silicon. Your primary use for it at this point would be for T2 circuits, which we wont get into in this part of the guide. Your secondary use for it would be the glass and concrete recipes which require silicon powder and which are used for higher tier buildings. Its a relatively simple production chain, just needs some nitrogen.\n9. Silver. The only use for silver during the green science era is for T2 circuits. It is also a simple metallurgy process, quite unlike the later silver/gold metallurgy lines.\n\n**Liquids/Gases:** I will cover the typical liquids/gases that you should be transporting around at a later date. Most of them arent too difficult to get.\n\n**NOTE:** It is your choice on how to handle coal + carbon. You can deliver it as wooden bricks to be converted on site, you can burn them to coal prior to entry into your dedicated metallurgy area, you can craft the necessary carbon near the furnaces that need them, or once again create them in bulk at the entrance to your dedicated metallurgy area. Keep in mind that most blast furnaces require fuel (charcoal in this case), but while it will be better to use solid fuel or other alternatives (when they become available) instead of charcoal, the amount of fuel actually used makes it not really worth it. Do be aware that carbon is a fuel, so furnaces will happily grab it instead of charcoal which is in fact inefficient and should be avoided. If you have a 1/2 & 1/2 line of both snaking its way, make sure to prime the furnaces with the fuel type (charcoal) you want them to use and make sure there is always fuel available for them on the line.\n\n# Bio-science and bio-fuel\n\nThis part of the guide can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seablock/comments/qmxsay/seablock_bioguide/)\n\n# Liquids & Gasses\n\nThis will be the next part of the guide. I will focus on the various liquids & gasses that are required throughout the seablock run (base ones, not the specialized ones like within oil), along with their methods of production. This will include the common ones like oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, chlorine, etc; and also the acids necessary for ore processing.",

    "body": "I've been evangelizing DIY ECN-2 for quite a while, and realized I'm typing out the same somewhat long-winded explanation over and over for individual people who ask. So I'm making this post primarily to have a destination to refer people to if they ask.\n\nMandatory disclaimers: I am not a chemist. I understand how the chemistry side of things in film development works only at a very layman's level. If I get something wrong here, I hope someone with better chemistry knowledge can help correct me.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\nYou should consider developing your own color film at home using ECN-2 chemistry that you mix yourself instead of from a kit. Why? Here are a few reasons besides the obvious advantages of cost savings, turnaround times, and in-house control of your final results:\n\n1. Developing C-41 film in ECN-2 chemistry, in my opinion, produces better results than developing ECN-2 film (even with remjet removed like Cinestill) in C-41 chemistry. Obviously that's subjective, but having tried both, I strongly prefer the former. For me, it makes sense to keep ECN-2 ingredients on hand, as they can be used to develop ANY type of color film I care to shoot, including slide film. The obvious exception here is if you plan on optically printing your C-41 negs via RA-4 - just use actual CD-4 developer if that's your intended use case. But if you're scanning, any small color casts can be easily corrected in post.\n2. ECN-2 chemistry uses CD-3 as the color developer, while C-41 uses CD-4. As it happens. E-6 slide films also use CD-3. This means you can use your ECN-2 chemistry (including bleach and fix), in combination with a black & white developer (like HC-110) to [develop slide film](https://www.reddit.com/r/Darkroom/comments/197a1cz/test_2_with_ecn2_chems_for_processing_ektachrome/) with [excellent results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Darkroom/comments/19ejulm/its_official_i_dont_need_to_buy_real_e6_chemistry/) and a higher degree of color accuracy than you could achieve using C-41 chemicals.\n3. In the USA (can't speak for anywhere else in the world), the ingredients are easy to source and inexpensive enough that you can mix up 250ml of developer (enough to develop 3 rolls of film before chemical exhaustion) for about $1.50 USD, give or take. This is cheap enough that I don't feel bad mixing it up and using one-shot for a single roll of 24 exposures. I actually keep several pre-mixed quanities of powder on hand in film canisters. Only the CD-3 powder needs to be kept separate from the rest during storage. When it's time to develop, I just dump a canister into 250ml of water, shake it up for a minute, and stick it in the hot water bath to heat up to temp. Gone are the days of saving up 12 exposed rolls of film so I can justify buying a kit. I no longer have to worry about shelf life.\n\nI used [this article](https://grainy.vision/blog/ecn-2-processing) (which I did not write) to get my recipes. The person who wrote it did a lot of the leg work for testing out and adapting Kodak's published formulas for use in a non-industrial setting.\n\nThat said, I have further adapted the recipes on that site to make smaller quantities, and I have found substitutes for (or simply omitted) ingredients that were expensive, difficult to source, or hazardous. So all the proprietary \"Kodak Anti-Fog\" and whatnot are absent from my recipes. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**1. Remjet pre-bath**\n\nI mix this up 500ml at a time and use at the same 105¬∞F as the developer. It has a virtually infinite shelf life, and can probably handle something like 20 rolls of film before losing effectiveness. Handle the lye carefully, use gloves. With actual Vision3 that doesn't have the remjet removed, I get better results and have a much easier time getting the film totally free of remjet when I use this recipe, compared to any of the simpler \"just use baking soda\" type recipes out there. YMMV. Obviously this pre-bath isn't needed for films without remjet.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Borax|10g|\n|Sodium Sulfate|50g|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (lye)|0.5g|\n|Sodium Carbonate monohydrate (washing soda)|7.5g|\n|Distilled Water|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**2. Developer (250mL)**\n\nI use this one-shot. 250mL is enough for up to 3 rolls of 135-36 or 120 film (or sheets of 8x10 film). Even with just one roll of 35mm, 250mL is not enough liquid to cover the roll while at rest, which means you will need to use constant agitation to avoid uneven development. If you don't have a rotary developer or other automated solution, that just means you need to be inverting manually for the full duration of the developer step. The powders can all be pre-mixed and stored in a film canister, with the exception of CD-3, which will degrade if stored in contact with other ingredients. I keep my CD-3 in an airtight jar.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sodium Sulfite|0.5g|\n|Sodium Bromide|0.3g|\n|Sodium Carbonate monohydrate (washing soda)|7.5g|\n|Sodium Bicarbonate (baking soda)|0.675g|\n|CD-3|1g|\n|Distilled Water|Balance to 250mL|\n\n**3. Stop Bath (500mL)**\n\nI am not using the sulfuric acid-based stop bath from the linked article, despite Kodak's insistence that it's necessary. I have not seen any downsides. This amount of stop bath has virtually unlimited shelf life, and a conservative capacity estimate of 10 rolls. I keep it in liquid form and pour back into the bottle (recording the tally marks towards exhaustion) after each use.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Kodak Indicator Stop Bath|4.7mL|\n|Water (distilled not necessary)|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**4. Bleach (500mL)**\n\nAgain, I have simplified the recipe here. The ferricyanide is what's doing the work. I haven't found a need to use sulfuric acid in this recipe either. Shelf life here is basically unlimited; capacity is about 20 rolls of film. I use in the same way as stop bath (track exhaustion and re-use until I hit it).\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Potassium Ferricyanide|20g|\n|Sodium Bromide|12.5g|\n|Borax|0.75g|\n|Water (distilled not necessary)|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**5. Fixer (500mL)**\n\nSame story - keeps long enough that I don't worry about shelf life. Capacity of 10 rolls of film. Re-use until exhaustion.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Ammonium Thiosulfate (60%)|90.65mL|\n|Sodium Sulfite|5g|\n|Sodium Metabisulfite|4.2g|\n|Water (distilled not necessary)|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**6. Stabilizer (500mL)**\n\nColor stabilizer is a controversial topic. You can go read Photrio forums for a lively debate about whether it's needed, what substitutes for formaldehyde are most effective, which manufacturers did what cool tricks to avoid using formaldehyde, etc. As for me, I figure it's easy and inexpensive enough to mix a bit of formalin in with my final PhotoFlo rinse and just not worry about whether my films have been properly stabilized or not. All of my films (C-41, ECN-2, or E-6) get a final minute or two in the stabilizer, so I can be confident that the color dyes are as stable as possible. Do be extremely careful with formaldehyde (or formalin, as it's called when mixed in water). It's very nasty stuff.\n\nThis stabilizer has a shelf life of forever, and a capacity of roughly 20 films, to make a conservative estimate. Once nice benefit of mixing the formalin in with the final rinse is that it seems to kill anything that would otherwise try to grow in the PhotoFlo solution.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|PhotoFlo 200|2.5mL|\n|Formalin (37%)|5mL|\n|Distilled Water (ALWAYS use distilled here)|Balance to 500mL|\n\nThose are the recipes. The process I use is as follows:\n\n|Step|Temp|Time|Comments|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Pre-Bath|105¬∞F|30s|Just use a few fills of 105¬∞F water for C-41 films. The remjet-pre-bath for ECN-2. Vigorous agitation (I literally shake the tank) if handling remjet.|\n|Developer|105¬∞F|3m for ECN-2, 5m for C-41|Constant agitation. Temperature is critical here, more than any other step.|\n|Stop Bath|95¬∞F - 105¬∞F|30s|No water rinse in between developer and stop - the stop much more quickly and effectively kills the developer action. Constant agitation preferred.|\n|Rinse|95¬∞F - 105¬∞F|3x tank fills|Agitate vigorously to get the stop bath off the film.|\n|Bleach|95¬∞F - 105¬∞F|3m|Constant agitation.|\n|Rinse|95¬∞F - 105¬∞F|3x tank fills|Agitatie vigorously to get the bleach off the film.|\n|Fixer|95¬∞F - 105¬∞F|3m|Constant agitation.|\n|Wash|I slowly decrease to room temp|6m|Wash in running water. If developing a film with remjet, use a latex/nitrile-gloved hand to carefully but very thoroughly rub off all traces of remjet under running water here. This can make or break the results - if you miss remjet during your final wash, it looks terrible in the scans.|\n|Stabilizer/Final Rinse|Room temp|1m|Very gentle agitation - you don't want bubbles if you can avoid them.|\n\nDespite the ways I've deviated from Kodak's published formulas and procedures, I have been getting excellent results. Hope you can enjoy the same benefits of doing this DIY! It's not as hard as it sounds.",

Washing soda is not mono, so you‚Äôd use 69 grams per liter or 17.25 grams per 250 mL. \n\n2. acetic acid (Kodak stop) is much weaker than sulfuric acid.  The final solution also has a pH of around 3. Where the final solution of sulfuric acid is around 1. When you use it to stop the very alkaline developer it will raise the pH making it less effective every time. So I would one shot the stop bath if using acetic acid. \n\n3. For the bleach if you‚Äôre adding borax you are 100% raising the pH to way too high of a level without an acid bringing the pH closer to 6.5/7.

Thank you!\n\nSince reading your recommendation, I just came across a series of blog posts on the topic of ECN2 vs C41 film and processing by Koraks (a Photrio moderator and excellent analog photography tinkerer). In addition to techniques and chemistry, he highlights his success in developing ECN2 film (like Vision3 250D) for longer times in ECN2 chemistry to achieve negatives that work for optical RA4 color printing. An interesting outcome that piques my interest, as it addresses one of my main concerns on a potential limitation of ECN2 film (recognizing you‚Äôre doing ECN2 processing in C41 and potentially other film stocks).

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens¬Æ B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens¬Æ B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

    "body": "So in my junior year of highschool, I was in an honors chemistry class.  Pretty much everyone was level headed, hard working, and just wanted a decent grade.  I still talk to a few people from this class to this day, years later.  Then there was Kevin.  He wasn't malicious, and actually pretty outgoing, leading everyone including the teacher to assume his antics were just him being the class clown... Until after a bit of several students having to slowly describe basic subjects to him, having him copy answers, etc.  we all slowly realized he was just that much of a Kevin.   My favorite moments were:\n \n -when the class realized he wasn't joking.  We were in a bunch of large groups studying the basics of atoms.  It took him a bit of convincing that you really couldn't see atoms in a regular microscope, and that those were just bacteria cells he had seen in biology last year.  Kevin then was convinced that the school had a microscope that could see atoms, and thought it was stupid that we couldn't use it.  We had to explain to Kevin that no, our public school did not have the money or space to really have that type of microscope, he probably saw some other one, he was convinced that we all were either joking, or it was some weird school conspiracy.  We just decided to move on. \n \n -when the teacher realized he wasn't joking.  At some point the teacher was describing the formation of dry ice in a lab, and what you would need to make it.  At some point Kevin stands up in the middle of her talking, and asks \"so what's black ice made of?\" The teacher asks him does he mean what he finds on the road in winter, and Keving gives a \"well, yeah!\" Response.  She, with the most dumbfounded look on her face, explains that black ice is just normal ice, and reexplains step-by-step dry ice.  The then asks if dry ice feels dry, and she, shellshocked at this rate, explains that you can't touch it unless you want to lose your skin in a bit more graphic terms, since he didn't seem to understand that some things shouldn't be touched in chemistry \n \n -when we almost let natural selection take it's course.  At some point, we were doing a lab where we were mixing hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide to make salt water.  Considering Kevin's lack of understanding of lab safety, the teacher decided to give us an extensive talk about the dangers of hydrochloric acid (which none of the other non-kevin classes got btw, we all knew why).  At this rate, Kevin was barely passing thanks to the sympathy of classmates, and probably cheating.  His understanding of chemistry was nonexistent, and most knew it was probably a mistake that he was here.  He didn't understand basic reactions, or anything really.  So when the eacher explained that the reaction made saltwater, and probably would be safe to consume if done exactly right.  Wrong word choice, teacher.  Kevin then decided that if could drink salt water, he could drink the hydrochloric acid.  He then was convinced that the eacher was just trying to scare us, and kept getting other kids to dare him to drink the hydrochloric acid (nobody agreed, but nobody really said otherwise either) until the teacher overheard Kevin say \"I'm going to do it!\" And had to pull him aside.\n \n -when he wanted to set the classroom on fire.   At the end of the year, the teacher was showing us something cool with fire, and strted showing us how some powder/liquid could burn on top of a nonflammable object, making it look like it was burning.  Kevin of course has a great idea.  The teacher should pour the powder/liquid all over the floor under the desks so we could look like we were sitting in a classroom on fire, or at least do the rows between the seets to see it go by.  It didn't hurt the rod, so it wouldn't hurt the desks, right? The teacher started telling us it was a bad idea, and Kevin quickly pipes up that we could pull our feet off the floor, so we would be safe anyway.   Luckily, the teacher didn't plan on setting the room on fire, and just told him no.  ",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

I knew the product worked well, I had done suitable testing on a range of applications with favorable feedback, so I created a brand and launched the business.  The need for a this product came about by our family inheriting a relatives cat who peed everywhere inside the house including a fruit bowl‚Ä¶. but that is another story..and yes it had fruit in it and yes we ate it not knowing why it tasted salty. :-)  &nbsp;\n\nI taught myself SEO, promoted hard to get things going and although it was a small business, it was growing steadily and life was good, however things took a major change one day when I received a very unusual phone call.  &nbsp;\n\n**‚ÄúDo you guys clean up dead bodies and can you remove all of the odor‚Äù?**&nbsp;\n\n**I wondered if I had  a serial murderer on the phone**looking for someone to help him with his latest conquest, or maybe Ray Liotta from Good fellas trying to remove the smell from the trunk of his car.  You remember that scene right?  &nbsp;\n\nAfter a pregnant pause mainly caused by me being dumbstruck and lost for words (that is a rare thing)  the next thing I heard myself saying  was\n‚ÄúYes we do Sir, when would you like us to start and where can I collect the keys from‚Äù   &nbsp;\n\nWTF who said that‚Ä¶. Oh that's right it was me. I had no experience in cleaning or removing dead bodies, no idea of what was involved or how bad it could be, but I was willing to give it a try. One thing I had on my side was I knew how chemicals worked on organic matter. Dead bodies are organic matter so the same principles should apply. (I hoped)  &nbsp;\n\n**Lesson 1 - Believe in your abilities and accept work you THINK you can do.**   &nbsp; If  you think about this you really have nothing to lose and everything to gain so taking risks and doing new things in your business can lead to increased opportunities. \nYou will have failures along the way and they are a critical part of growth. Without failure your business won‚Äôt grow. Sensible business involves understanding cost versus risk, or in other words if the trial costs a lot of cold hard cash then make sure you can afford to lose it. In my case is was only my time and a few hundred dollars of equipment.  &nbsp;\n\nAs it turned out it the guy on the phone was a contractor to the coroner who was being let down consistently by a large cleaning franchise (who shall remain nameless)\nThe contractor was receiving complaints that the homes still stunk after the cleaning company treated them, so he was looking for some additional resource and I was it.  &nbsp;\n\n**Lesson No 2: Don‚Äôt show lack of confidence when speaking with people. It will never help you in business and personal life.**  &nbsp; Talk with authority and if you don‚Äôt know something just say I will come back to you on that.  &nbsp;\n\nSo I turned up at the house with overalls, thick chemical resistant gloves, googles, breathing masks, safety boots, some tools and cleaning equipment, plus some brutal chemicals that I had been testing out on meat and other things to simulate dead body residues the night before. I know I know‚Ä¶mad scientist right? I had no idea what removing a body would involve and I also had no idea what cleaning up after them entailed although I could imagine what I thought it would be like.   &nbsp;\nI had also not heard back from the contractor of when I would be met by the vehicle to transport the body to the morgue. I had rung and left messages and emailed 2-3 times.   &nbsp;\n\nI entered the house nervously and the first thing that hit me was the smell. It was a combination of the odor produced when you first put a piece of meat into a hot oven to roast , combined with a bitter/sweet metallic like smell. It was bad but not as bad as I expected. There were hundreds of dead flies in the house and I opened all the windows to let some air in, then went to investigate the area. I had a filtered mask on and a full body suit on as bodies produce airborne bacteria which can be inhaled. (I had read that online prior to going) :-)  &nbsp;\n**Thankfully the deceased person had been removed 30 minutes prior to me arriving..Phew!!! ** I was off the hook on that one and I am sure my emails and messages had produced some smiles back in the contractors office when I asked who would meet me to transport the body. A rookie error for sure but I did not get any flack on it and it was never mentioned.\nThe deceased person had passed away in the bathroom and fallen onto the floor. The sad thing was that their meal was still on the dining table untouched from 3 months ago. Possibly they had gone in to wash their hands before their meal, or use the toilet but either way they did no make it.  The food had shrunk away to nothing, dehydrated completely and was so small it looked like miniature plastic food for a doll. The deceased never got to eat that meal and that thought stuck with me for a  long time, in fact to this day it still serves as a valuable lesson in life.   &nbsp;\n\n**Lesson Three: Don‚Äôt waste a day in your life. You never know what is around the corner and life is a precious gift that should never be taken for granted** &nbsp;. I think of that abandoned meal when I am feeling a bit gloomy and it is a great tonic to perk me the %$#@ up.\n\n**The Big Cleanup**  &nbsp;\nThe floor in the bathroom was a complete mess. There was a lot of skin and hair remaining and the floor was sodden with body fluids. Lying on the floor for 3 months means you basically melt into the floor, and as we all know a human body contains a lot of fluid. End result is it makes one hell of  a mess. Some of the fluid evaporates over time as the air oxides it but the bulk of it remains and damages flooring and other substrates.  I figured that this could be the reason why the cleaning company was struggling with removing the odors and I was just the kind of obsessed chemical / Odor Dude to fix this.  They call me Craig The Odor Dude but the way :-)  &nbsp;\n\nI rang my mate up who is handy with a hammer and nail and he came over to help (once he had clarified that there was no body there ) :-)  &nbsp;\nWe inspected the area together and decided the floor in the bathroom needed replacing as it was beyond repair. Particle floor board is like a sponge once it gets wet and it loses its strength as the glue separates from the particles. \nBefore we got started on the removal of the floor, I was keen to test out my chemicals on the residues so I applied a brew to the area to see the results. I used a combination of Sodium Hydroxide and a Commercial Grade Peroxide ( Oxidizer) . I was fully kitted up with safety gear and took extreme care when handling the concentrated products. These chemicals will cause a lot of damage to your skin if you come into contact with them and if you get them in your eyes you will be blinded for life with a lot of pain in the process.   \nThe ‚Äúbrew‚Äù certainly did the job and it consumed the waste matter including the hair and skin residues very quickly. The only downside was the horrific odor it caused, so we raced outside for fresh air and left it to do its work. Thankfully this was a one level home and when treating apartments with residents below extreme care needs to be taken so as not to cause damage to the property below.    \nBy the time we went back in, the chemical had done its thing and the residue was gone.  I was able to extract what was left with a commercial wet vac and warm water plus give the surrounding area another good flush with warm water to help extract anything I had missed.   &nbsp;\n\nAfter gaining permission from the  contractor we ripped up the floor, and removed the toilet and bath. Luckily we did that as the body fluid had soaked into the floor under the bath and toilet as well so that would have been an issue area for years to come. Once the flooring and Scotia was removed and safely disposed off, I treated the floor joists with my chemical and and left it for the night.   \nWe put up **DO NOT ENTER SIGNS** IN RED around the house and  **WARNING** signs on the floor joists in the bathroom just to be on the safe side and came back the next day.  &nbsp;\n\nWith the flooring removed the house smelled a lot better than the day before and we soon had the new particle wood floor back in, new vinyl installed, the bath and toilet reinstalled (after a thorough cleaning) and the room back to normal. I then placed an ozone machine in the house for 24 hours and we came back for the sniff test the following day.  &nbsp;\n\nIt was perfect, no odor at all and the home smelt fresh and clean. We were proud of our achievement and I believed we had done the best job we could do.  \nI prepared my invoice and presented it to the contractor. His mouth dropped and I gulped. We had been too greedy I thought, I am have over charged I thought, opps I have blown it‚Ä¶..thats the end of my odor removal days, but in fact it was the complete opposite. We had undercharged and that was why his mouth dropped.  &nbsp;\n\nHe said *this is half of what we normally pay for the other company to do the work and they don‚Äôt ever replace the floors*.  With this good news the relationship was formed and we went on to do  $54,000 approximately of contract jobs and gained a reputation for excellent work. Not all jobs required floor replacement and a lot of them were easy.  &nbsp;\nWe went on to offer other services like creating Asset Lists, doing Asset Disposal, and so on. A lot of families wanted a turnkey solution.&nbsp;\n\n**Lesson Four: Keep your pricing fair and ensure you know your costs thoroughly.**  &nbsp; Also get a feel for the ‚ÄúValue proposition‚Äù that the clients experience when dealing with your business, as this can help you in raising your price without losing work.  Get feedback on your work and your pricing regularly.  &nbsp;\n\nI found the work hugely rewarding, knowing that we had helped the family of the deceased on-sell the house successfully and the purchaser could be assured that they had a sanitary home without any lingering odors of a rotting human being. Quite a good thing to have I might add as the opposite can cause problems for many years to come and be very unhygienic and dangerous. (A lot of the jobs we did were drug addicts so getting rid of all remnants was mission critical for health and safety)  &nbsp;\n\nOver the following period we did some horrific jobs and on those jobs I focused my mind on a family with young kids moving in and that motivated me to get the job done to a high standard even when the jobs seemed impossible. I pictured the family inside the house enjoying their lives without the horror of what had occurred leaving any trace to upset them.  &nbsp;\nSpeaking of horrific jobs here are some of the worst ones I remember. We had 3 jobs where people had died on the toilet and they are horrific to clean up, we also had 20-30 fridges that had been turned off when the power bill was not paid and the meat and food in the freezer part was 100% rotting. With no oxygen present inside the freezer the smell was the worst possible smell you could ever imagine. If you want to know what makes an Odor Dude vomit then this was it and be careful when opening the freezer door as pressure builds up from the gas and if you get sprayed with the water you will hurl your guts out for hours and I mean hours.  I had many runs into the back yard to lose my breakfast when doing fridges. 1000 times worse than deceased body odor. Then there was the guy that had died and as he fell had grabbed a cupboard that had a roll of picnic wrap on the top and the lot came down on top of him including the plastic. 4 and 1/2 months he lay there rotting into the floor while the neighbors went about their business, no one noticing the increasing number of flies, (I still to this day do not understand where they all come from)  &nbsp;\nWe also had murder scenes with more blood than you could ever imagine, and other equally gruesome jobs to do, but I always maintained the high standards and acted professional to ensure we did the best we could. Focusing on the family who would move in was a winning formula for me.  &nbsp;\n\n**Lesson Five: Having a focus for the end goal helps achieve the project with less stress and effort. This applies to business and your personal life.**   &nbsp;\n\nI eventually got out of this business and focused on the product side of the company which I went onto sell in 2013. I now provide Odor Removal advice online to end users and trade people.\nCheers Craig The OdorDude [odordude.com](http://www.odordude.com)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Instant Power drain cleaner. \n\nPurchased a 32 oz bottle for $7.50 at a ReStore shop. This particular drain cleaner is anywhere from 35 to 60% lye according the the safety data sheet. Should be 1 lb of lye in the bottle. \n\n1 lb of lye in 5 gallons of water provides a solution of around 2.5% lye. You can dilute that jug by a lot. \n\nAdd 1 quart of water, it‚Äôs 25% lye. Add another gallon, 12.5%. Do the math. \n\nSo, the 20 minute method - \n\nPut the workpiece in the tub and cover with water. Pour in enough of the drain cleaner. To get the ratio you want. Go to bed, go play golf, whatever. \n\nNext morning put your gloves on, grab the iron and a scrubby. Degunk. Don‚Äôt splash lye on your dog. Wash with dish soap and dry well. \n\nPic 3-5 shows out of the bath and ready to season. If this for sale or a gift I would  hit it again to get it all gray, but this is going to be a DD and seasoning will cover anything left at this point. \n\nYou have now spent less than 20 active minutes to strip a CI skillet or whatever. Repeat if necessary. \n\nBest part is you can use the lye solution over and over again. \n\nI‚Äôll never understand why someone would choose to try and scrip to get this clean.\n\nNote on drain cleaner: I tried it as it is easily accessible to anyone. Not all use lye, listed as sodium hydroxide. You have to check the SDS (safety data sheet) to see what is in it.",

    "body": "I've seen posts over the past few weeks talking about the taste of the water in the city and I wanted to clear a few things up and give a basic outline on how Houston's water systems work. \n\n\n**[City of Houston:](https://www.publicworks.houstontx.gov/taste-drinking-water)**\n\n85% of the drinking water in COH comes from surface water sources, like Lake Conroe, Houston, and the Trinity River. This water is sent to one of the 3 surface water production facilities around the city where the water is strained, filtered, coagulated, then treated with chemicals like chlorine+ammonia ([chloramines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochloramine)), chlorine dioxide, Ozone, and some other fun chemicals. \n\n\nTypically elemental chlorine (gas) or liquid sodium hypochlorite are used to disinfect ground water, but when you have surface water you have to use chloramines due to the organic matter in surface water (think fish germs, plants, and algae). When chlorine comes into contact with those biological materials it creates disinfection byproducts (DBP), which are hazardous over prolonged consumption.  When chlorine is used in conjunction with ammonia it will create Monochloramines, which do not produce disinfection byproducts. There is a balancing act that has to take place known as [breakpoint chlorination](https://blog.orendatech.com/hs-fs/hubfs/breakpoint%20chlorination%20curve-2.jpg?width=1800&name=breakpoint%20chlorination%20curve-2.jpg), if you underfeed you don't create a strong enough disinfectant, but if you overfeed then you get di & tri chloramines. These compounds can react negatively with the organic compounds in the water. Over time the transmission lines will develop a film of nitrogen or algae and will need to essentially be shocked. The common term is a \"[free burn](https://www.tceq.texas.gov/assets/public/comm_exec/pubs/gi/gi-466.pdf)\" where the water lines and plants are super chlorinated in order to scour the lines. While there may be a temporary change in taste or smell, there are no associated health risks with a short term switch to chlorine disinfection. \n\n\nOnce the water leaves the surface water production facilities, it is sent out to smaller booster stations around town, and from there to MUDs. At each stop the incoming water is tested with either online analyzers, or daily hand tests. Depending on the chloramine residual in the incoming surface water these booster stations are designed to automatically adjust the chemical dosage based on water chemistry and flow rate. This water is then analyzed again once it leaves the plant and goes into residential systems. It is then tested again at the end of the loop, usually from a fire hydrant, or sample line. If at any point unsafe drops in disinfection residual is found the operators of these plants will either make an adjustment to the dosing of the disinfection chemicals, drain the line of stagnant water, or enact a free burn if ammonia buildup is detected. \n\n\n**MUDs:**\n\nMunicipal Utility Districts for the most part are not incorporated into the City of Houston and are in charge of water, sewer, and other infrastructure. These are normally found in the suburbs or outlying areas in Houston and operated by a third party operations company, or in very rare occasions, by the MUD district themselves.\n\nIf your MUD is not on interconnect with the COH or another MUD that is using chloramines, these water plants are ground water facilities, which will only feed chlorine since there shouldn't be any bilogical demand from the source water, so there is no worry about DBP's.\n\nIf your MUD district is on interconnect with the COH, or another MUD district that uses chloramines these plants will use chloramines for disinfection. \n\nAll plants that use surface water have backup wells in case the COH is facing a drought or some other issue feeding water. These wells are regularly exercised and are used primarily as backup.\n\nWhenever one of these ground water plants goes through a chloramine conversion your water will taste and smell like cat piss, but only until the chemical levels are balanced out (usually no more than a month).\n\n\n\n**Source water quality:**\n\nLike I said before we get the majority of our water from surface water sources. We are blessed (/s) with extremely hard water, due to a large amount of calcium and manganese in our water. This is where water spots, and other issues come from.\n\nSome of the aquafers can have methane, sulfur, or arsenic in the water which have their own treatment/removal strategies.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe city of Houston and the surrounding cities do not have all the same water source, and each differs on the source water quality, treatment, and transmission. If you are curious about your water I recommend looking at your water bill and seeing who you pay, and where your water comes from. Some MUD's and cities have some good writeups and information pages on source water, treatment, and FAQ's.\n\n\n\n**Notes/fun facts:**\n\nDue to our overreliance on ground water, Houston has subsided 1ft (~10ft in some areas) due to aquifer depletion. This was one of the main drivers to [convert the city to Surface Water.](https://txpub.usgs.gov/houston_subsidence/)\n\n[Sugarland](https://www.sugarlandtx.gov/327/Water-Operations-and-Information) pulls water of the Brazos river, and they hit their water with flocculation, membrane filters, activated carbon filters, chloramines, sodium hydroxide, fluoride. They won best tasting water in the state, and were runner up for best in [NA in 2019](https://www.sugarlandtx.gov/329/Water-Quality#:~:text=The%20City%20of%20Sugar%20Land's,Conference%20and%20Exposition%20\\(ACE19\\).). Also they are having a [scheduled free burn on March 1st.](https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2022/02/09/sugar-land-water-might-smell-taste-different-in-the-coming-weeks-heres-why-authorities-say/)\n\n[Pearland](https://www.pearlandtx.gov/departments/public-works/water-quality-report) currently gets it's water from the Chico and Evangelist aquifers, and COH surface water. They are building their own surface water treatment plant so they no longer have to rely on the COH.\n\n[Conroe and parts of the Woodlands](https://www.sjra.net/water-transmission-pipeline/) are fed by the SJRA surface water treatment plant up by Lake Conroe.\n\nSurface water is being brought out to the MUD's in Harris and FB counties, there is a good explanation video on this page under \"[what to expect from construction](https://surfacewatersupplyproject.com/)\"\n\n\n[Remember when half the city lost water pressure the first day of the rodeo cookoff two years ago?](https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2020/02/27/these-videos-show-the-impact-of-water-main-break-flooding-in-east-houston/) That is because one of the 100 in+ transmission lines was hit by a backhoe. That's the amount of water that was being sent by these production facilities. \n\nI won't be able to answer any questions about PFAS or chromium in the ground water since it isn't my area off expertise.\n\nIf the taste and odor of your tap water are too strong, and you have the money, install a full house filter or RO machine (don't ask me for recommendations, I have never dealt with these).\n\n~~Chloramines kill fish, so use bottled water.~~\n> u/JJ4prez: They make products like Seachem Prime and Aquessential and other items that get rid of chloramines (and is a dechlorinator) in tap water to make it fish safe. Much cheaper and it's like pennies on the dollar to treat when applied to a 5 gallon Home Depot bucket for a water change. Most aquarium hobbyist already know this, but for the unaware who are reading or potential fish owners.\n> \n> The true key to most tap water after conditioner is PH levels. For the most part, most tap water in big city markets are neutral, but if you live in an area with your own well or a funky water situation, always test the PH of the tap water before doing an aquarium :). Fish/invertebrates/etc. all have varying PH needs.\n> \n\n\nChloraminated water cannot be used for dialysis. \n\nDon't use tap water for a neti pot.\n\nIf your water is brown it could be a number of things, pressure change in the distribution system, high levels of total dissolved solids, rust in your pipes, if the a fire hydrant was recently used. I really don't have a good suggestion since it can be any number of issues.\n\n\nPersonally, I drink COH tap water that goes through either a fridge filter or a Elkay EZH2O.\n\n\n***EDIT 1***\nFish stuff above\n\n\n***EDIT 2***\n\nJust asked my boss why the water has been so funky for some lately, and his response was:\n\"It is most likely a chloramine imbalance in the water due to Lake Houston/the reservoirs \"[flipping](https://media.nationalgeographic.org/assets/photos/000/292/29293.jpg)\". The plants are probably having a hard time correcting for the change in source water chemistry\"\n\nLarge bodies of water have layers that have different densities, and temperatures. When the seasons change the heat from the surface and the waves will cause the lake to mix, kicking up dissolved solids and changing the chemical makeup of the lake.\n\n[Here is a blogpost from one of the Engineering firms in Houston about the taste and smell issue](https://ehrablog.wordpress.com/tag/lake-turnover/)",

        "body": "*Abstract:*\n\n>This perspective proposes a potential pathway to diminish atmospheric CO2 accumulations which is distinct from traditional carbon capture and geological sequestration strategies and from existing negative emissions technologies (NETs). Unlike conventional sorbent- or solvent-based CO2 capture processes where substantial energy expenditures are associated with demixing and desorbing CO2, the single-step carbon sequestration and storage (sCS2) approach relies on electrolytic carbonate mineral precipitation using renewable energy within a simple and scalable process design. Although numerous approaches have implied electrolysis for carbon management, the sCS2 approach is unique in the following ways: (1) CO2 mineralization for promoting solid carbonate formation: The thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to carbonate precipitation are overcome by direct and in situ electrochemical forcing to stabilize dissolved inorganic carbon and divalent cations \\[Ca,Mg\\] to form carbonate minerals. (2) Flow-through membraneless electrolysis: A flowing electrolyte (seawater) is dissociated while in motion. The process utilizes cost-effective mesh electrodes while also decreasing the number of components and assembly steps and reducing the risk of device failure. (3) Integrated electrolytic reactor‚Äìrotary drum filter: An electroactive thin-film mesh cathode (eTFC) is suggested to be integrated within a rotary drum filter configuration, allowing for the filtration of dilute and polydispersed mineral precipitates at a low energy cost. These attributes render sCS2 as an approach worthy of more detailed evaluation, development, and scaling for global-scale carbon management.\n\n[Paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561)\n\n[Article](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/using-seawater-to-reduce-co2-in-atmosphere)",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¬π. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.¬≤\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¬π n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"¬≤ Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease¬≥. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.‚Å¥  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp‚Åµ.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea‚Å∂.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¬π, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¬π.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.‚Å∑ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA‚Äôs approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¬π¬π \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¬π¬≤ It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¬π¬≥ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR‚Å∏, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.‚Åπ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¬π‚Å∞ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

The more commonly used calcium carbonate mineralizing (dissolving)agent, tends to produce crystals with frosted or ‚Äúmatte‚Äù faces. The crystals also grow 50% more slowly.

Stomach in knots, I reluctantly held it out to her. Our fingers brushed against each other during the transaction. To my shock, her hand didn't burn. \n\nHer plastic grin stayed where it was as she chirped, \"I've just started here, so please be patient with me! I don't want to make a mistake on my first day, you know?\"\n\nThe churel's ID badge hung from a pocket on her blue, professional-looking jacket. For the sake of not pissing her off or giving away our employer's location, we'll say that the name on it was Aanya Kaur. \n\nAfter studying my badge for a moment, she handed it back to me, cheerfully saying, \"Have the day you deserve!\"\n\n*Yeah, fuck you, too.*\n\nOf course, I didn't say that. I may not make the best decisions, but I don't have a death wish. Instead, I returned her smile, nodded, and went through the door without daring to take my eyes off of her. In turn, she watched me like a hawk as I departed. \n\nAccording to my sixth sense, Ramy was  around the corner in the main hallway. It took a lot of effort not to run there. The placard on the door denoted that he was in a server room. Before I could touch the doorknob, it swung open, revealing a tired-looking Ramy. \n\nAfter peeking around to make sure that we were alone, I spoke above the hum of machinery, \"Did you see our new receptionist?\"\n\nHe went back to messing with one of the servers as he replied, \"Yup. She'll be back here in a moment.\"\n\nI balked, \"What?!\"\n\n\"She said she wants to talk.\" Seeing my expression, he added, \"Don't worry. After last time, she knows better than to try anything.\" \n\nThere was a light knock on the door. When Ramy let Aanya in, she did her best to keep as much distance from him as possible. Meanwhile, Ramy simply went back to screwing with the server, not appearing to notice or care about her obvious unease.  \n\nAanya got straight to the point, announcing that she wanted a truce. She swore not to lay a hand on me as long as Ramy agreed to leave her alone. Though instead of using my name, she referred to me as Ramy's 'boy toy.' \n\nHoping that neither of them could see my face reddening from her humiliating nickname, I got the bravery to utter, \"Please don't talk about me like I'm not here.\"\n\nShe spared me a glance, \"You got your voice back! Good for you!\"\n\nRamy finally spoke, but didn't bother to stop his maintenance in order to look up at her, \"That's all up to him.\"\n\nI hadn't expected the choice to be mine. At his response, Aanya's jaw clenched as she side-eyed me. I got the impression that she wished that she could tear into me again. \n\nI questioned, \"Will this truce just be at work or... does that also extend to outside?\"\n\n\"Both, preferably.\" She replied curtly. \"I want nothing to do with this jinn.\"\n\nI nodded, \"I'm thinking that would be best for all of us. We just... show up, do what we need to do, and leave each other alone.\"\n\nAanya hesitated, gathering herself before she said, \"For the record, it was nothing personal, jinn. I am being tested, same as you.\"\n\nTested? \n\nRamy simply waved her off, \"Yeah, okay. See you around. Just a heads up though, the coffee here sucks, so you might want to bring your own.\"\n\nHer brow furrowed and she opened her mouth, but reconsidered whatever it was she was going to say. She threw me one last dirty look before her long skirt rustled, showing a brief glimpse of her backwards feet as she exited. \n\nAfter she was gone, Ramy glanced at me, \"I'm not trying to be a dick Lab Rat, but I've *really* got my hands full with this, so would you mind leaving me to it?\"\n\nI started to oblige, but then paused, gathering as much courage as I could to ask him to come visit the house later. He agreed to it, then kicked me out. \n\nThere was a lot that needed addressed, the most pressing thing being how I could grow up here without any unnatural encounters, yet the moment Ramy showed up, my hometown suddenly seemed to be crawling with horrible things. \n\nIt might sound na√Øve, but I felt like we were at a point in our relationship where I could begin to pry into his world without getting cursed again. At least, I hoped that was the case. If I hadn't told anyone his secrets already (this subreddit excluded), I probably never would.  \n\nIt had also become increasingly clear that I couldn't ignore my feelings towards Ramy anymore. I just wasn't entirely sure how. In yet another installment of how pathetic I am, I admit that I have almost no experience with things like this. The closest I've ever come to any sort of 'romance' (and that term is used *very* generously here) were some awkward dates in college that never went anywhere. I don't know if you can count the two times Ramy locked lips with me, considering that they both occurred in relation to the voice theft. \n\nWhat do normal people do in situations like this? Do they just... *say* it? Was I overthinking it? I had to have been. This was stupid. I wished I could just put my brain in a bag of rice until it started working correctly. \n\nBy the time my shift was over, I had worked myself up into nervous wreck. Ramy was going meet me at my house after stopping by his apartment. Apparently, his water was back on. This gave me extra time to pace around my living room, unable to stop agonizing. \n\nYou'd think after all that's happened, a simple conversation wouldn't get me so anxious. \n\nIt didn't help that when I turned around to make another nervous lap, Ramy was suddenly *right there.* I almost ran into him, jumping back with a sharp intake of breath, causing me to choke on my own spit. \n\nHe stared at me as if my reaction was outlandish, \"You good?\"\n\nAfter I stopped drowning in my own saliva, I rasped, \"Just a heart attack.\" \n\nCiri trotted over to him, not startled by his abrupt appearance in the slightest. He scooped her up, cradling her like a baby as she purred. \n\nScratching the kitty's chin, he asked, \"You wanted to talk, didn't you?\"\n\nUnsure of where to start, I picked the first thing that popped into my head, and unfortunately, it was barely coherent, \"So, I've lived here for... *ever.* Until I met you, nothing strange has ever happened to me. Now, it's pretty much constant. Like that woman from the bar. That wasn't random, right? It *felt* random at the time, but it wasn't!\"\n\nHe gave me a small smile, \"You're right. That encounter wasn't random. Neither was the one with Aanya.\"\n\nOut of the blue, Ciri bit Ramy. She does that sometimes. He gave her a disapproving look before setting her back onto the carpet.  \n\nHe continued, \"Long story short, the entities that reside here are territorial. They aren't too welcoming to newcomers.\"\n\nThat's how I learned that Ramy is 200 years old, which is apparently young for a jinn. \n\n\"So... the old fucks want you to get off their lawn?\" I replied, making sure I was understanding correctly. \n\nRamy seemed to like that comparison, \"Pretty much.\"\n\nAs we all already knew, Ramy had originally come here to satisfy his vendetta against the brothers. However, the entities that dwell here interpreted that as an affront; he had indirectly undermined their claim on the land and its residents. The implication that the mysterious entities he's been referring to felt like they *owned* the people here, myself included, made me feel somewhat sick. \n\nWithout thinking about it, I started pacing again. Ramy settled comfortably on my couch, shining eyes tracing my movements.\n\nAs I circled the living room like a caged tiger, I asked, \"Alright, if there have been these... *things* living here this whole time, why did I never see them until recently?\"\n\nThat earned me a smirk, \"Oh, you probably have, Lab Rat. You just didn't know it.\"\n\nI thought back to the woman at the bar. How I could only see what she truly was from the corner of my eye. \n\nPushing my discomfort to the back of my mind, I moved on to my next question, \"Before Aanya bit me that one time, she said that she could smell you on me. Is that why these things have been coming after me, too?\"\n\nHe nodded, \"You're guilty by association.\" \n\n\"Okay, so going off of that other shit Aanya said earlier today, was that incident with the long-armed woman in the bar some sort of test?\"\n\n\"It was, one that I knew you'd pass because I did a *hell* of a job on that wish. As much as I wanted to stop her, and believe me, I *did* want to, that would've given the impression that I wasn't confident in my own abilties.\"\n\nWhen I made another pass by him, I suddenly felt his cool hand gently catch my wrist. He advised me to take a deep breath. I obliged him, closing my eyes, trying to get my bearings. His thumb traced delicate circles along my skin, giving me something to focus on besides driving myself crazy. \n\nAfter a another heavy exhale, I felt that I had myself as under control as I could be. His hand slid from my wrist as I joined him on the couch. \n\n\"What exactly are *'they'?* The ones you keep mentioning?\" I finally asked. \n\nRamy shrugged, \"Eh, some German spirits, and I've seen a few things from my neck of the woods here and there. It's a diverse mix of jackasses.\"\n\n\"Would it help if I used my last wish to get rid of them?\"\n\nHe snorted, \"That'd be a waste. I can handle anything that comes our way.\" \n\nFeeling brave, I retorted, \"But for how long? When does it end? When one or both of us dies?\"\n\nAs unruffled as ever, Ramy answered, \"No, it will end, eventually. As long as I can keep on proving that I'm capable of defending us both, which I *will,* they'll back off. If you're that concerned, you can always use your last wish to save yourself. Otherwise, you're just going to have to trust me.\"\n\nI took my glasses off and rubbed my eyes. As ridiculous as it sounds, I honestly *was* beginning to trust him. Not fully, since I know that at the end of the day, Ramy is arrogant and self-serving, but I truly believe that he does care, in his own way. \n\nSpeaking of caring... I decided it would be best to not to give myself the chance to overthink, causing me to blurt out, \"I'm attracted to you.\"\n\nI remember thinking, 'Well. I *definitely* did not do that right.'\n\nShows how much I know. The only warning I had was Ramy saying, \"It's about fucking time.\" Before his lips were on mine. \n\nI'm pleased to report that nothing horrible happened during or after the kiss. No burning blood or tar. Just a kiss. One that I'm not going to stop thinking about any time soon. \n\nI'm not going to share what else happened that night, so I hope you all can respect that there are some things that I would like to keep private. It has nothing to do with The Horrors anyways, and that's what you're all here for, right? \n\nAnd *boy,* have The Horrors found me. \n\nBefore I delve into that, I think it's fair to warn anyone that's sensitive to the topic of lab animals, particularly the death of a mouse, to take caution before reading ahead. I will only touch on it briefly and I won't go into graphic detail, but I thought it best to give you all a heads up. \n\nMy lab coordinator needed someone to go down to the animal facility in order to check on one of the mouse litters. Since the person on first shift is absolutely useless, the task fell to me.  \n\nUnfortunately, one of the mouse pups had been cannibalized by its littermates. This is why I'm glad that I do mostly cell cultures; mice are *vicious* to one another. I placed what was left of the poor thing into a paper bag, as protocol dictates.\n\n When a lab animal dies, it has to be taken to the post mortem room for proper disposal. The bodies are left in a walk-in refrigerator for the animal husbandry technicians to cremate. Naturally, the walk-in is usually kept closed for obvious reasons. \n\nBut this time, when I entered the post mortem room, the walk-in was wide open. At first, I thought that maybe it was one of the animal husbandry staff, until I heard crunching. \n\nProtocol be damned, I was *not* sticking around to find out what that was about. \n\nCautiously, I started to back out of the room, paper bag still clutched in my hand. The crunching continued. Whatever it was, it didn't know I was there yet. I kept going, not daring to even breathe out of fear that it would alert that thing to my presence. \n\nI reached behind me, feeling for the door. As soon as my fingers grazed it, the crunching stopped. I froze, listening, hand paused on the handle. The clopping of what sounded like hooves on the tile floor echoed throughout the room as whatever was in the walk-in started to come out. \n\nA whispery, childlike voice drifted from the open walk-in, *\"I can help you.\"*\n\nHair standing on end, I slammed the door shut and darted away. At some point, I must have dropped the bag, but in my haste it became an afterthought. I turned a corner as I heard the door slam against the wall, followed by the stomping of hooves. I passed a room labeled 'chemical storage' that required an ID card to enter. I scanned my badge, almost cheered when the card reader turned green and beeped, then ducked inside. \n\nDespite having a locked door between us, I still didn't feel safe. Without turning the lights on, I read the labels on various bottles, looking for something that could be useful. I found a bottle of 10N sodium hydroxide. If you've never used this before, just know it burns like hell when it gets on your skin, which is a lesson I learned the hard way in undergrad. I clutched the bottle, hid behind a nearby shelf, and tried to listen for my pursuer. \n\nThe ghastly voice spoke again, \"*I'm not like the other one. You can trust me.*\"\n\nIt was getting close. The next time it spoke, its voice sounded different. More feminine. \"*You have nothing to be afraid of.*\"\n\nThe card reader beeped twice. Whatever was chasing me worked somewhere in the facility. \n\nThankfully, two beeps meant that my pursuer's card was denied. Either it didn't read the card correctly or it didn't have the right security clearance. I hoped it was the latter. The door handle rattled impatiently. I clutched the bottle of sodium hydroxide tighter, praying that the hoofed being outside wouldn't break the door down. \n\nThe handle rattled again as the creature rasped, \"*You left me a present. A small thing.*\"\n\nThe mouse pup. *God.* \n\nWhat the creature said next made my heart sink, \"*But I need more. I need something fresh.*\" \n\nIt tried its card again. One beep. *Shit!*\n\nThe door opened slowly; I think it did this to make me more nervous. It worked. I began to unscrew the cap on the sodium hydroxide, steeling myself as I watched it step into the room through a gap in the shelf. \n\nGrey, donkey-like hooves poked out of green scrubs. The uniform for animal husbandry staff. \n\n\"*Your heart is beating so hard.*\"\n\nMy muscles stiffened, both from fear and anticipation, as its hooves tapped next to the shelf. I took in a shaky breath before I jumped up, swinging the sodium hydroxide in a wide arc. It splashed on the creature's face. \n\nIts face changed in front of my eyes. At first, it looked like a young woman, but as it cried out, its mouth morphed into a cat-like snout, revealing sharp, yellowing teeth. It clutched its eyes, howling in what sounded more like rage than pain. \n\nI shoved past it on my way out the door. Blinded, it grabbed for me, missed, and stumbled into the shelves. \n\n\"*I can hear every breath you take, you piece of shit!*\" It roared, its voice now unnervingly deep as its hooves pounded on the tile after me. \n\nI ran for my life. The hoofed creature continued to berate me, insisting that it could find me wherever I went. Thankfully, with it being blinded and disoriented, it had a hard time navigating the hallways, but even so, it was *fast.* Distantly, I noted that the back of my right hand was stinging. Some of the sodium hydroxide must've splashed on me. \n\nI crashed through the door out of the animal facility, making a beeline for the stairwell. My lungs were burning by this point, but I kept pushing myself, getting to the second level faster than I ever have before. My lab and the IT room were on the third floor. Just one more to go. \n\nThe echo of the thing's hooves bounced off the walls of the stairwell, making it hard to judge how close it was without risking a glance over my shoulder. \n\nBy the time I reached the third floor, I was exhausted, panting, legs feeling like wet noodles. But still, I kept going, knowing that Ramy would be in the IT office. I expected the door to the stairwell to fly open at any second, but it never happened. \n\nIt looked like Ramy was in the middle of a conversation with the other IT guy, but as soon as he saw the state I was in, he went to me without explanation, leaving his coworker incredibly confused. \n\nHe helped me get to the bathroom so I could rinse the sodium hydroxide off. The skin was a deep shade of red, but thankfully, it didnt blister. It's probably going to peel off later. Can't wait. \n\nStill trying to catch my breath, I eloquently explained what happened, \"Animals... hooves... it-it's down there! It's *eating* them!\" \n\nRamy's hand was on the small of my back, calming me as he studied the chemical burn. \"It doesn't look that bad.\"\n\nSince this wasn't my first caustic burn, I already knew that I had to rinse it for twenty minutes. In the meantime, Ramy asked his coworker to stay with me with the excuse that he was going to get the first aid kit. I sensed that he was in the animal facility shortly afterwards. \n\nOnce we were alone again and my hand was taken care of, Ramy informed me that he didn't find the hoofed creature. It must've known he'd be coming for it. \n\nAs of right now, I'm safe at home, all gauzed up. It hurts to move, but again, this isn't my first chemical burn. And as far as injuries go, it could be worse. \n\nI've only just started looking into it, but so far, I think the hoofed creature is [another type of jinn. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/gowxKXdx9E). \n\n\n\n",

Also the Prequel hypochlorous is my fave bc it‚Äôs affordable but has the best packaging to keep it stable with a luxury sprayer that‚Äôs not like $60 (cough cough hydrinity)",

I bought a bottle of it cuz I was out of my Ordinary Glycolic Acid that I use on my body and also my Dr Dennis Gross Peel Pads for my face (was waiting for their sale to restock my big box. Been using these for a couple years). Now I‚Äôve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn‚Äôt irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it‚Äôs not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It‚Äôs light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products. The Half and Half in particular seems like would be perfect as a daytime moisturizer in my ridiculously hot and swampy weather\n\nTheir Gleanser, Vit C, and Urea moisturizer are already at HG status for me",

This fictional scenario completely dissolves the bodies, leaving behind nothing but a red sludge¬π. However, let's separate fiction from reality:\n\n1. **Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)**:\n    - HF is toxic and corrosive, but it's not as strong of an acid compared to other hydrohalic acids.\n    - It will break down some tissues over time, but it won't turn the entire body into something that can be easily rinsed down the drain.\n    - HF poses a real threat of delayed, life-threatening damage by scavenging calcium from the body.\n    - In reality, using HF to dissolve a body would be quite difficult and dangerous¬π.\n\n2. **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**:\n    - HCl is a stronger acid and is available by the gallon from hardware stores.\n    - While it will eventually work by breaking down connective tissues, it will make a huge stink and take several days to dissolve certain types of tissues and bones.\n\n3. **Sodium Hydroxide (Lye)**:\n    - The standard body-dissolving chemical is lye, also known as sodium hydroxide.\n    - Lye is commonly found in drain clog removers and effectively breaks down organic matter.\n\nIn the show, Walter White specifies that the container must be made out of **polyethylene plastic**¬≥. However, in reality, using HF to dissolve bodies wouldn't work as efficiently as depicted on screen. Sodium hydroxide (lye) is a more practical choice for such Macabre tasks.\n\n* Thanks for the upvotes to my crazy AI question. I was looking at my Xbox controller I showed to Bing's \"AI\" - it ranted about LDPE plastic or some other thing which I thought was too much info üòÇ\n\nSo naturally my next thought was 'ok what was the breaking bad plastic that Jessie didn't get??' PEP?\n\nSo now you can be üíØ sure I'm almost not a serial killer if I was , I would not use Hydrofluoric Acid! üòú",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won‚Äôt meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That‚Äôs the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won‚Äôt be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there‚Äôs a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it‚Äôs a glass jar and it‚Äôs 2 oz. But it‚Äôs a very ‚Äúwet‚Äù texture which I don‚Äôt like because then I can‚Äôt apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene? The packaging says not to use any other acne product so I just really haven‚Äôt really tried it but was curious if anyone knew.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai ü§°\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* : ¬†Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin‚Äôs DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn‚Äôt penetrate beyond the skin‚Äôs superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier ü•≤. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask üòñ. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol.

I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn üî•üî•. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 ü•µ)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ‚óè ALCOHOL DENAT. ‚óè TRIETHYL CITRATE ‚óè DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ‚óè SILICA ‚óè ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ‚óè BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ‚óè ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ‚óè BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ‚óè GLYCERIN ‚óè PROPANEDIOL ‚óè C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ‚óè SODIUM CITRATE ‚óè METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ‚óè PERLITE ‚óè TOCOPHEROL ‚óè CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ‚óè ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ‚óè CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ‚óè CITRIC ACID ‚óè DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ‚óè DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ‚óè HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ‚óè TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ‚óè TRIETHANOLAMINE ‚óè TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ‚ú®lazy‚ú®\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?ü•≤ hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai ü•≤\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this üòñ somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao ü§° maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see üëÄ / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai üíÄ. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai üòñ)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai üò´)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "Owner of a gas station hired me to wash the sidewalks, around gas pumps, and wash his building. I pointed out that there was etching damage as shown in the second before photo, but I would do my best to get everything cleaned up. I used a light sodium hydroxide mix, surfaced cleaned at 3200 psi, and spent a good amount of time going back and hitting stubborn areas. I was pleased with how it turned out. Come back the next morning when they opened to do the walk through and he refused to pay. He claimed that I made the property look worse. \n\n   He told me that I ripped up his concrete and now he can see exposed aggregate. He said that my pressure washer cut the crack between the asphalt and the curb and now he is having water flow under the building and that must be repaired. And in the 2nd photo he tried to tell me that he did a better job dumping muriatic acid on the concrete with his little machine (you can see the results he got) I showed him the before photos showing no new damage and he didn‚Äôt want to see them. Even with setting reasonable expectations for his poorly maintained 20+ year old property, he was adamant that a professional like myself could make it look new again. \n\n   So at this point I brought out the estimate that explained in detail everything I was approved to do, explained that completed the scope precisely. I removed all the dirt, removed or lighted oil and traffic stains, removed all organic growth and spider webs from the building AND showed him the disclaimer he signed that stated I was not responsible for discoloration of concrete, and that some stains can not be removed in a safe and responsible manner. \n\n   Then, completely ignoring what I explained to him, He then pointed to the 20yr old asphalt that was cracking and falling apart, pointed to some dirt near the edge of his property 70 ft from his building and told me ‚Äúsee that, you blew that out of the ground and now I have cracks that will flood my building‚Äù and I was done. \n\n I offered him a 50% discount and he happily got his check book.  I took additional photos of each of his claims in case it was escalated. I still made a profit so I‚Äôll take it as a win. \n\n  The lesson here is to always set VERY clear expectations, make sure you have a detailed estimate, take close up photos of ANY existing damage, take plenty of after photos of the same areas or areas that didn‚Äôt come clean, and have a good disclaimer that they sign. This person had zero red flags of being problematic, you never know who‚Äôs gonna try to con you. He could have tried to make an insurance claim if I didn‚Äôt show my documentation. ",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as¬†caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as¬†green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "**This was an Adderall fueled post. I‚Äôm about to nerd out big-time here. Scroll down for TL;DR!**\n\n\n**First, why do I care about vitamin c?**\nI recently decided to add a vitamin C serum to my skincare routine because of all the great effects I‚Äôve read about.  Really, it seems as skincare ingredients go, vitamin C is amazeballs, and I‚Äôm not talking anectodtal ‚ÄúOMG it made my skin feel so much better‚Äù shit, I‚Äôm talking legit scientific research showing several skin benefits. It‚Äôs a fucking fabulous antioxidant,  it is photoprotective against UVA and UVB stress, it is an *essential ingredient* for collagen synthesis AND upregulates (causes) collagen synthesis, and it is effective at preventing and lightening dark spots through inhibiting the enzyme Tyrosinase, which is *the* rate limiting enzyme for melanine production^1,2 . AND, do you like Vitamin E? Because Vitamin C regenerates oxidized vitamin E molecules so your body can use them all over again^3 !\n\n\nWe‚Äôve known the much of the details of the dermatic glories of Vitamin C for over fifteen years. Clearly, we all want lots of vitamin C. Some of this can be provided in our diets, but gastric absorption of vitamin C is downregulated by the levels of vitamin C already in your body, which means most of that supplement you have been taking just gets peed out (but I‚Äôm sure the fish appreciate it). So, in order to elevate the levels of vitamin C in our skin, it needs to be applied topically. Problem is, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a tricky motherfucker. It‚Äôs SO effective *because* it‚Äôs so reactive as an antioxidant, which means it‚Äôs got major stability issues. It oxidizes REAL quick in solution, and this oxidation rate increases along with temperature, air, and light exposure. My guess is this is why vitamin C only recently surged in popularity as an ingredient in skincare products; manufacturers are certainly getting better at formulating (for instance, adding Ferulic acid to stabilize vitamins C and E^4 ), manufacturing and packaging products in a way that maintains their effective shelf life. The problem is, not every manufacturer is actually going to spend the time and money to ensure quality, and many companies may just ride the Vitamin C bandwagon without considering these things or caring if it is actually effective in their product. \n\n\n**Why am I concerned about pH?**\nProblem number two with vitamin C products is their pH. We‚Äôve heard time and time again that it is important for the pH of skincare products to remain low to ensure efficacy. A quick Google Scholar search brought up an article on the effects of pH on Vitamin C absorption in particular^5 .  The researchers showed that in a solution of a pH 4 or above there was no detectable increase in skin vitamin C levels (it wasn‚Äôt absorbed), while [vitamin C levels are elevated at a pH of 3.5 and increase as pH lowers](http://i.imgur.com/seqMDmj.png). This same study also showed that the [best concentration for maximum vitamin C levels is 20%](https://i.imgur.com/LIgBvzl.png) (for some reason there is a decrease in vitamin C at higher percentages) and that even though it is the least stable, [L-ascorbic acid is the best ascorbic acid derivative to use](https://i.imgur.com/jYgAcZg.png).\n\n\n**Choosing a Vitamin C Product**\nGiven all of this fantastic information, I am convinced that pH is a critical factor for an effective vitamin C product. Unfortunately, as a poor graduate student, my choices in skin care products are financially limited. Given that I have science, I decided to also try making my own. I purchased some vitamin C L-ascorbic acid crystals from the Vitamin shoppe and ground them into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. I then used a digital scale to measure out the powder and, using deionized water and glycerol, made a 20% weight by volume solution of L-ascorbic acid serum.  I actually really like how it turned out. I used this first and saw visible improvement in the redness of my skin after a week or two. \n\n\nStill, I wanted to try something ‚Äúreal.‚Äù Much as I‚Äôd love to, I can‚Äôt usually spring for the expensive, already researched and well reviewed products, and so I searched Amazon for a cheap alternative. I settled on [ArtNaturals Enhanced Vitamin C Serum](http://www.amazon.com/ArtNaturals-Enhanced-Vitamin-Serum-Hyaluronic/dp/B012Q4M3DO/ref=sr_1_5_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1461786401&sr=1-5&keywords=vitamin+C+serum) because it was under $15, claimed to contain 20% Vitamin C, and had many positive reviews (4 out of 5 stars from over 9000 reviews). \n\n\nThe first problem I noticed with this serum was in the ingredients list ‚Äì it does not contain the L-ascorbic acid form of vitamin C, but instead what is reportedly an aqueously more stable, while less studied form called Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate. I didn‚Äôt sweat this too much, because it wasn‚Äôt tested in the earlier study^5 I mentioned, and a more recent paper reported good absorption levels^6 .  I wasn‚Äôt impressed. It wasn‚Äôt bad, but it didn‚Äôt seem any better than the serum I made. It was actually a bit sticky, comparatively, and my skin didn‚Äôt tingle like it does with my DIY serum. I decided to test the pH of both serums, and WOAH. \n\n\n**Testing the pH ‚Äì RESULTS!**\nFirst, let me show you how the [pH test strips I used work using vinegar and water as examples/controls](http://i.imgur.com/Aqfxg6L.jpg). The strips are wetted in the solution for 1-2 minutes then compared to the swatch which shows pHs from 0-14 at 0.5 intervals. There are 8 dyes that are affected, and the closest swatch match is used. This example shows, from left to right, vinegar, vegetable glycerin (glycerol), bottled purified water (Dasani), and city tap water. As expected, vinegar was the most acidic, but it fell in at around 1.5-2. That‚Äôs actually more acidic than you‚Äôd expect from white vinegar  (~2.5 pH). Glycerol and bottled water checked in around 6.0 again, a bit lower than expected, and my tap water was ~7.0. I didn‚Äôt have any buffer to check these strips with (I‚Äôll test them tomorrow in my lab), but it looks like might be showing acidity a little low. If so, it looks like it might need about a +1 correction term, but because pH is a logarithmic scale I can‚Äôt be sure. Anyway, we can at least move forward and see our pHs relative to vinegar and water!\n\nNext, I tested my homemade 20% L-ascorbic acid serum. It is about 3-4 weeks old, and is stored in a dark glass dropper bottle (an old Korres serum bottle). I was shocked to see it falling in at a [pH of 1.5, right where the vinegar was.]( http://i.imgur.com/wE9uEC3.jpg) If it IS 1.5, that is stupidly acidic, not to mention virtually impossible to achieve. L-Ascorbic Acid is a diprotic acid with pKas of 4.17 for the first proton dissociation, and 11.57 for the second. This means, given the maximum saturation concentration in water of 33%, I‚Äôd only get a pH of 1.87, which would look closer to 2. Visually, its similar to the vinegar, so my guess is it‚Äôs a pH of 2.5. I‚Äôm actually pretty happy with that. I‚Äôd almost call it *too* acidic, but my skin is responding well to it, so I‚Äôm content. \n\nNow for the shit I bought off of amazon! Are you prepared to be impressed! [Well, sorry to disappoint you, but this shit was basic.](http://i.imgur.com/B7DhUNm.jpg). Okay, not *very* basic, but around or above neutral. Visually, I‚Äôd call it 7.5-8. Even if my strips are showing things as a bit lower in pH, it‚Äôs more basic than the water I used as a control, and not anywhere CLOSE to the necessary effective pH of <3.5. This stuff is absolute shit. \n\nI will concede that this isn‚Äôt the *same type* of vitamin C used to determine pH/absorption profiles. However, the skin has a pH of around 5 and generally a lower pH is considered necessary to maintain effectiveness and to be absorbed into the skin, as shown in studies for other nutrients^7 . I'm probably going to keep making my own serum. I may actually buffer it up to a pH of 3 with some sodium hydroxide once I measure it with a calibrated pH probe in my lab (tomorrow). \n\nMy curiosity also lead me to test a few of other products that I use regularly. \n\n*Alpha Hydrox 12% AHA Souffl√© (glycolic acid): pH 4.0-4.5\n\n*CeraVe Renewing Salasylic Acid Cleanser: pH 4.5\n\n*Retin-A Micro 0.08% Pump: pH 4.5\n\n*Dermapeutics Kyaluronic Lift Serum: pH4.0-4.5\n\n\nI hope you found this somewhat interesting. I certainly did, which is why I just spent 2 hours testing and writing about it! It‚Äôs probably not a bad idea for everyone to test their products for pH ‚Äì test strips are relatively cheap, and it‚Äôs easy to do at home and important information to have!\n\n\nSOURCES CITED:\n\n1.

It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling.

Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch üòÖ. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above. Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/‚ÄãWater/‚ÄãEau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), üåü[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, üåü** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Cr√®me\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.  Pictured above. Feels heavy for a lotion.\n\n**Ingredient List :**[Aqua/‚ÄãWater/‚ÄãEau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), üåü[**Zinc Oxide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide)**,** [Sorbitan Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-stearate), [PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-30-dipolyhydroxystearate), [Butylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butylene-glycol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Copper Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/copper-sulfate), üåü [**Mannitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol)**,** [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), üåü [**Xylitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol)**,** [Zinc Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-sulfate), [Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Vine Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/vitis-vinifera-vine-extract), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose),[Laureth-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-3), üåü[**Asiaticoside**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiaticoside)**, üåü**[**Madecassic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/madecassic-acid)**, üåü** [**Asiatic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiatic-acid), [Hydroxyethylcellulose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethylcellulose), [Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract)\n\n**Fragrance:** A subtler version of that greasy smell, a teeny bit herbal, to be this dissipates the quickest of all the bioderma moisturisers.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  üòç I love it. I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. üòÖ.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ‚ú® **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ‚ú®  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nüëâüèæ All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\nüëâüèæ For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\nüëâüèæ If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\nüëâüèæ Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\nüëâüèæ I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\nüëâüèæ  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies üôè\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

    "body": "Slime. Its a sticky green substance found in swamplands and superflats. Say that 10 times fast.\n\nI've been trying to avoid organic substances(i.e. substances that make up life; molecules which contain carbon), as they are a lot harder to find and a lot less documented than inorganic substances(substances that do not contain carbon).\n\nThese are some of the properties of slime balls:\n\n- green\n- slimeblocks stick to everything except obsidian and glazed terracotta(and others for gamebreaking/technical reasons)\n- slimeblocks are elastic(when you land on them, an elastic force pushes you upwards)\n- when heated, it loses elasticity(magma cubes do not stretch when they jump, they [split](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft-computer/images/b/bf/150px-Magma_Cube_Jumping.png/revision/latest?cb=20140407005202))\n- slimeblocks have an opaque 'inside' with a translucent 'outside'\n\nThere are two types of stickiness: adhesion and cohesion. Cohesion is stickiness between the same substance while adhesion is stickiness between different substances. Obviously slime blocks do adhesion, as they stick to almost everything.\n\nAdhesion has several different types, some are mechanical, some chemical. Here are a list of possible types:\n\n- interlocking; voids and pores are filled with the material e.g. velcro, sewing\n- ionic, covalent or hydrogen bonding; materials make chemical bonds, brittle enough so they can be pulled apart but not too brittle so they stick together\n- van der Walls; materials are pulled together by van der Walls forces; slight positive and negative charges bring materials close\n- electrostatic; materials pulled together by positive/negative forces\n\nIts highly unlikely that it is the van der Walls/electrostatic forces because that would mean almost all blocks would have to be positive/negatively charged. I could see the interlocking happening; slimeblocks grow and conform to blocks it touches to stick to them. Bonding is probably less likely as it would have to react with almost every chemical.\n\nLet's check other properties.\n\nSince it is elastic, but plastic(not elastic) when heated, this sounds a lot like a thermosetting polymer.\n\nWe now have explanations for why it sticks to blocks(it grows and conforms to them) and why it is elastic, and how it is plastic when heated(it is a thermoset). We could say that it can't stick to obsidian and glazed terracotta because they have smooth surfaces and slime blocks can't grow to smooth surfaces.\n\nSo slime is a green living thermosetting polymer that grows to new blocks near it. Simple.\n\nThermosetting polymers are a lot easier to find, and green dye can be applied to make them green. Lets list them:\n\n\n\nVinyl ester resin, made by an epoxy resin reacting with an acrylic acid. Its base reactants include propene and benzene, from oil(made by plants and animals); hypochlorous acid from bacteria; and oxygen, from air. However chlorine and sodium hydroxide are not found in nature, meaning this cannot exist.\n\nBakelite, made by phenol reacting with formaldehyde. Its base reactants include propene and benzene from oil; oxygen from air; and methanol, which exists in organisms naturally.\n\nFuran resin, made by furfuryl alcohol and furfural. Its base reactants include hydrogen from water. However, it requires xylose which doesn't exist by itself in nature.\n\nMelamine resin, made by melanine and formaldehyde. Its base reactants include methanol, which exists in organisms naturally; oxygen, carbon dioxide from the air; however ammonia does not exist in nature as it decomposes.\n\n\n- Oil can exist in swamplands, as life exists there, and sediments in the water can apply pressure to create oil.\n- If slimes contain methanol like most organisms, then bakelite could be a contender.\n\nBakelite is the only one left. Apply some [green dye](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/minecraft_gamepedia/8/82/Cactus_Green.png) and we have slime.",

This is why they have a sort-of \"face\" - that's the zooids being specific since their whole thing is to be specific.\n\nThe green dye is actually some form of chlorophyll mixed with the slime for swamp-dwelling specimens. Subterrranean slimes are likely to feed off detritus from dead hostiles akin to some deep sea creatures for the most part with actual carnivorous tendencies arising from their attacks. Smallest size slimes deal no damage because their nibbles likely scrape off too little tissue to be a problem.\n\nMagma Cubes arise due to nether-bound slimes feeding on detritus contain traces of blaze powder, causing the outermost slime layer to crust over in a way. Over time they have evolved to counteract this by splitting themselves instead of using a typical jump-like motion.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai ü§°\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* : ¬†Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin‚Äôs DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn‚Äôt penetrate beyond the skin‚Äôs superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi üíÄ)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask üòñ. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn üî•üî•. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 ü•µ)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ‚óè ALCOHOL DENAT. ‚óè TRIETHYL CITRATE ‚óè DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ‚óè SILICA ‚óè ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ‚óè BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ‚óè ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ‚óè BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ‚óè GLYCERIN ‚óè PROPANEDIOL ‚óè C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ‚óè SODIUM CITRATE ‚óè METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ‚óè PERLITE ‚óè TOCOPHEROL ‚óè CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ‚óè ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ‚óè CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ‚óè CITRIC ACID ‚óè DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ‚óè DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ‚óè HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ‚óè TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ‚óè TRIETHANOLAMINE ‚óè TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ‚ú®lazy‚ú®\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?ü•≤ hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai ü•≤\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this üòñ somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao ü§° maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see üëÄ / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less üòñ if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop üò≠. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)üò≠üò≠~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/‚ÄãC10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/‚ÄãPPG-10/‚Äã1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is üî•üî•üî•. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool ü§§ only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty üòñ I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao üòå so you can guess I go out a lot heheh.

I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (üòè)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason üò£üò£üò´\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ‚ú®‚ú®~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot üò´ imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good ü§°)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too!

I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries üòñ such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier ü•≤. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\n# Product Itself (Before Trying)\n\n**At a Glance (before opening)**:\n\n* Product size is 11.5 oz. / 326 g.\n* Product states that it is formulated with no parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, or petrolatum.\n* Product states that it is not tested on animals, is cruelty free, is ethically traded/sustainably sourced, comes from a certified corporation, is family founded, and is created with fair trade shea butter.\n   * [What does \"fair trade\" mean?](https://www.greenerchoices.org/fair-trade-certified/)\n* Product states that it is manufactured in the USA using globally-sourced ingredients.\n* Product jar itself is made from 35% recycled plastic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Description on Container**: \"Our Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream provides definition with a soft, flexible hold.  Formulated with Manuka Honey, Yogurt, and Fair Trade Shea Butter, this lightweight curl cream also hydrates and helps strengthen hair to reduce breakage while styling.  Experience significantly less breakage when used as the fifth and last step in the Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Directions For Use on Container**: \"After generously spraying hair with the MANUKA HONEY & YOGURT HYDRATE + REPAIR MULTI-ACTION LEAVE-IN, apply to clean, damp hair and work through.  Style as desired and air dry or diffuse to finish your look.  This is the ultimate finish to the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients as Listed on Container**: \"Water (Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin (Vegetable), VP/VA Copolymer, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Carbomer, Honey (Miel), Yogurt Extract, Yogurt Powder, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter, Inulin (Chicory Root), Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Hydroxide, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Sodium Phylate, Triethyl Citrate, Caprylyl Glycol, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredient Breakdown (with the help of the \"Is it CG?\" Engine):**\n\n1. Product contains two humectants: Glycerin (Vegetable) and Honey (Miel).\n   1. *Humectants absorb moisture and help balance dry and damaged hair, but humectants also pull moisture from the environment too.  It is advised to use humectants with caution if you live in environments are hot and dry.*\n2. Product contains two oils:  Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil and  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter.\n   1. *Oils are good at coating hair strands in order to seal moisture, but should be used with caution as they may build up over time (especially if you cowash).  It is advised to use a clarifying shampoo occasionally (about ever 2 weeks) to remove buildup that oils may cause.*\n3. Product contains a conditioning agent: Caprylyl Glycol.\n   1. *In this case, this conditioning agent is working as a film-forming ingredient over the hair.  Conditioning agents are water soluble but have potential to build up over time (can clean with clarifying shampoo, see note in oils for more info).*\n4. Product contains a moisturizing alcohol: Cetearyl Alcohol.\n   1. *Alcohols are generally added to hair products to improve their ability to penetrate hair.  This alcohol is considered a moisturizing alcohol, so it will not dry hair.*\n5. Product contains three botanical ingredients: Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, and Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter.\n   1. *Botanical ingredients are ingredients that are derived from plants.  Botanical ingredients generally help with cleansing, stimulating, nourishing, refreshing, soothing, moisturizing, normalizing, and deodorizing.*\n6. Product contains two preservatives: Benzoic Acid and Phenoxyethanol.\n   1. *Preservatives prevent growth of bacteria and micro-organisms in your product.*\n7. Product has fragrance.\n   1. *Fragrance is generally okay to use on hair.  People with scalp sensitivities or allergies to fragrance should avoid fragrance in products.*\n8. Product *may* contain a protein, but this would be a light protein if so: Yogurt Extract and Yogurt Powder.\n   1. *I am honestly not sure if this is a protein, but when looking up online, some sources do say that yogurt contains protein.  If this is a protein, it is likely a very weak form of protein that would not impact your hair too much (honestly, it would still probably be less protein than the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie, which contains silk protein).*\n\nHere is the full breakdown using the [\"is it CG?\"](http://www.isitcg.com/view/TZFBb9swDIX_CuHDYGMOeu8t8dJ1hyBGUqQY0AttszFRWTRoaYs27L-PyrKiN9N6j_z4-LvwxX1xHAlhJ7yEqAQ79PEN4VE8JfgE3-UcNcBL8ZgGxUDwGQ40Iys8jzzPNEAT1UGjhNNLUdQFW8dnEyqUW4xVDQ0FQk0O1q6XUVwNX13qSdlDeaIzBewcme7U3p3W0MgsLk2kNeydcW2jyoz2Ue4d_6AKHjRygD1bnwP37ONinmmKnhcoG1yCaAVHMrCr5n16thtWDZsYksoyk05xghb1jRnKHEKV34zcmFE7uUL8y6HcMTljvKWxvQTFPrzXrfwcsm09oF_EM8IXPnPAYNgblA67j0hPyv3IzlTbiQL3Jtrha1Sbf-X-D_HNR5dDakbuRRMcRIIxHEU76-0tn9tGRxnYVskXkgsPtmNLPiBpCqNysOifyIBXA6_CqrP13U2bxmyxED1O12xundoxuWttqBSsgIatQU6vwdluaX_yEfMxN-R_Cfew7nmwwSN5uSQzoc-vD4pnRd8TlJb0a5yq4s9f) engine.  I recommend using this engine even if you do not use the CG method because it lets you see what ingredients do what to your hair.  \n\n**Overall Impression Based on These Factors:**\n\nThis is my impression BEFORE trying the product.  Overall, this product sounds like a great replacement for those who are looking for a lightweight, protein-free (at least, from my analysis) curl cream.  I think this product would be a great alternative for those who liked the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but didn‚Äôt like the protein and weight that the Curl Smoothie had.  This product does have glycerin in it, which I know some hair types are sensitive to, so that could be a turn off for some people.  This product has a lot of moisturizing ingredients in it, so it will probably benefit those seeking moisture for their hair the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Information About the Hair this Product is Tested on (My Hair)\n\n**Curl type**: 3A \n\n**Porosity**: Medium-High \n\n**Width**: Fine \n\n**Length**: Somewhere between 12-24 inches \n\n**Density**: lower-normal \n\n**Damage**: I may have a little protein damage on my hair (may have overdid it with a rice wash), but other than that it is mostly healthy.  Last cut was a little over 3 weeks ago.  Last clarify wash was a week ago.  I generally have halo frizz around my scalp area which I am currently combatting with the upside-down shower method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other Products Used with this Product and Application Methods Used\n\n**Note**: All products are CG approved.  These are all the products I used on the day I tried this product.  I wash my hair every other day.\n\n**Pre-Treatment**: dampen hair, detangle with a little bit of the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt conditioner, scrunch out some wetness, apply overnight oil (sweet almond oil, olive oil, rosemary oil, tea tree oil mixture) and sleep with a processing cap on.\n\n**Shampoo**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Shampoo\n\n**Conditioner**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Conditioner\n\n**Deep Conditioner**: Raw Sugar Healing Power Hair Masque with Avocado Oil + Banana + Coconut Milk + Agave\n\n**Leave-in**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Multi-Action Leave-in\n\n**Curl Cream**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream (this product)\n\n**Gel**: Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard\n\n**Cast-breaker**: Shea Moisture 100% Argan Oil\n\n**Tools**: WetBrush Wet Brush, Microfiber head wraps (I use them as towels to scrunch), Xtava Black Orchid Diffuser, InfinityPro by Con Air Drier, my hands (for scrunching)\n\n**Method**: Wet hair while leaning forward (back of head facing ceiling and hair pointing down).  Shampoo roots while leaving forward and use praying hands to run shampoo over the rest of the hair.  Rinse leaning forward.  Apply conditioner leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute in product, squish to condish while leaning forward.  Let sit for 2-4 minutes.  Rinse while leaning forward.  Apply deep conditioner while leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute product.  Let sit for 8-15 minutes.  Squish to condish and leave a little in hair when finishing.  While leaning forward, apply leave-in and curl cream by using praying hands and then scrunching upwards.  Scrunch some of the moisture out of hair with a microfiber cloth, then praying hands + scrunch in gel.  Diffuse with Xtava‚Äôs Black Orchid diffuser on low heat low (\"cool\") speed, let hair sit for a couple minutes and scrunch out the cast with Shea Moisture‚Äôs 100% Pure Argan Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# First Impressions After Opening Product\n\nThe smell of the product is quite nice and very low-key.  It smells like the rest of this line if you have ever tried it.  The consistency is almost like lotion (if you have ever used Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion, think of that texture/look/consistency).  On a side note, the safety seal was INSANE to take off, so you‚Äôll *definitely* know if someone tampered with your product.  When compared to the curl smoothie, the curl smoothie is a lot more ‚Äúcoagulated‚Äù (idk how else really to describe it) versus this product, so this whipped curl cream definitely gives the appearance of being lighter than the curl smoothie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Thoughts During Application\n\nI applied this product while upside down (leaning forward so that the back of my head faced the ceiling and my hair pointed downward) and with near soaking wet hair by running a small amount on my hands down the top of my head first (not raking in).  After that, I applied a little more to my hands and used prayer hands to apply it down the length of my hair.  Something interesting I noticed while doing this was that the cream seemed to soak in immediately, like, in literal seconds.  At first I thought I wasn't using enough product, but as I continued using prayer hands around my hair I noticed that the product melted in all around my head.  When I scrunched after using praying hands, I noticed that the curls seemed quite defined (I had a little wet frizz, but this is nothing out of the ordinary for me).  The smell was very pleasant and didn't bother me at all during the application.  Something else I noticed was that this product didn't provide the same \"slip,\" or slippery feeling, that the curl smoothie did.  This may be because it wasn't as heavy as the curl smoothie, but it did leave my hair with its normal, slightly rougher texture that I normally feel (it felt like how wet hair feels without any product added).  I kind of actually liked this, since to me that was proof that it wasn't going to weigh my hair down and didn't create a film over the hair that brought it down, but I could still tell it was working because of how well my hair was holding a curl while wet.  Overall, I probably used a little over a quarter's worth (maybe a half-dollar coin's worth) of product, which for me is more than I'd use for the curl smoothie but less than I thought I'd have to use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Results\n\n**Before Scrunching:** As I am sitting here letting my hair settle after diffusing, I am looking at my hair and noticing the amount of volume it has now before breaking the cast that I do not normally get.\n\n**After Scrunching:** Holy volume Batman!  So after scrunching, I noticed that my curls definitely look softer than they normally do with the curl smoothie.  I'm not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing at the moment, so I'll have to see how my hair holds up for the rest of the day.  The cast I had wasn't entirely crunchy, so I may not have diffused for long enough which could also be the culprit, but unknown.  My hair smells sooooo good but is not overwhelming, which is nice.  My hair also feels a lot softer after having scrunched, so it looks like the cream doesn't turn your hair super rough.  [Here is what my hair looked like after I scrunched it (not my closet, sorry for the clutter in the background).](https://imgur.com/a/T08BGx3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Verdict\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am only one person, and this is only one product review.  As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\nMaybe it is still too soon to tell, but I really, *really* like this cream after this first wash.  It didn't make my finer hair feel weighed down after a shower, and I didn't have to be super careful to not overdo it during application like I normally have to do for the curl smoothie.  My hair feels softer and less \"wet\" than it normally does after I scrunch the crunch, which may be due to my gel or this curl cream, but either way I'm liking it.  Now that my hair is crunched, it feels extremely bouncy (like, I'm bouncing in the mirror just to see how it bounces) and lightweight.  I don't know how it will hold up in the elements, since I haven't gone outside, but for now it looks great.\n\nConsidering the price for the amount of product, it seems like a pretty good deal.  The Whipped Curl Cream's container is 11.5 oz (interestingly enough, the curl smoothie is 12 oz, so it looks like someone at Shea Moisture wanted to be funny).  I bought the tub for $12, so it looks like that is nearly a dollar per ounce, which I consider to be good for the price.  I didn't have to use a ton of product to get the result I did, so I anticipate this tub lasting me at least 6 months if not longer.  \n\nThe smell and consistency were great in my opinion.  The product didn't feel \"goopy\" like the curl smoothie and essentially melted into my hair, which I was totally not expecting.  This is probably due to the \"whipped\" nature of the product, as products marketed as \"whipped\" tend to be lighter and absorbed easily.  The smell was not overpowering, and I actually kind of preferred it over the curl smoothie to be honest (after a while, the curl smoothie begins to smell like over scented baby-powder/diapers to me).\n\nOverall, I think this product is *definitely* worth checking out if you are looking for a lightweight curl cream, have used the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but feel weighed down by it, or are looking for a curl cream for finer hair.  The price is good, the product looks good, and I am very happy with the results.  \n\nI hope this review may have helped some of you curlies out there!  Good luck on your curl journey :)\n\n# After a Week Update\n\nGood morning y‚Äôall!  So it‚Äôs been a week since I bought this product and I‚Äôve had some time to see how it performs with my hair.  I‚Äôll start by saying I think that it‚Äôs done well for my hair in that it is so lightweight, but sometimes I still find it hard to style my hair without that ‚Äúcoating‚Äù the curl smoothie gave me.  I have noticed that I‚Äôve had a bit more wet frizz than normal, which I had a really bad buildup episode so it could be that or this cream, but I‚Äôm really not sure.  I‚Äôve still also noticed that my hair seems to become a bit more frizzy when I scrunch the crunch, but I have a funny feeling that that‚Äôs due to the new gel I tried and not this cream, but it could be.  Here is a pros and cons list of what I‚Äôve noticed over the past couple days:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. Product is very light weight and clearly does not weigh down my hair.\n2. Product forms wet curls well when scrunched in (but may need a strong-hold gel after to keep them).\n3. Product smells great (I prefer it way more than the curl smoothie).\n4. Price point for product is very affordable.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. Product may not be able to support certain curl types without more hold (I have 3a hair, may work better for wavier hair but this could also be a gel problem).\n2. You will need to use more product than expected to get results.\n3. Product may contribute to wet frizz (my hair had a ton of buildup so this may have contributed too)\n4. This is not a curl cream that you can probably add in and then walk out for the day, it will most likely require a gel to help the hold.\n\nOverall, I‚Äôd rate it 7.5/10.  It‚Äôs worked really well for my hair, and this rating could go up when I try swapping my strong-hold gel back into my routine and see if it was the cream or the gel that isn‚Äôt holding my hair.  The product makes my hair so soft once my routine is done and doesn‚Äôt weigh my finer width hair down, but I do have to use more product than I normally did with the SM CS.  I‚Äôm definitely going to use up the rest of this jar, and I still highly recommend this to people who are looking for a lightweight curl cream to try.  Unfortunately, there is no sample size containers out there and I did email Shea Moisture asking about samples, but they essentially told me to take a hike so that was a no.  Regardless, if you are able to get your hands on this product, I think it is definitely worth a try!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for your extremely thorough original post, and for the update. Your hair looks great!\n\nI have somewhat similar hair, have been experimenting with products for a while, and have yet to find any holy grail products. Reviews like this help a lot!\n\nI used to have such a simple hair routine, several years ago. I‚Äôd occasionally shampoo with T-Gel for scalp issues, but would normally cowash with a conditioner (not CG) and use a little of the same stuff as a leave in, then scrunch with a T-shirt and air dry. Depending on how badly I needed a haircut, I wouldn‚Äôt need any styling product until refreshing, and my hair would have good clumpy ringlets up front and a good wave in the back on my short-ish style. But then my perfect conditioner was discontinued. My hair has never looked as good with so little effort since. \n\nIt‚Äôs improved a lot since this round with CG, mostly due to this sub. My curls can get curlier and the waves in the back are sometimes curls, but my hair seems really sensitive to both protein and humidity. I‚Äôm in the Pacific Northwest, so we can get a lot of humidity! I‚Äôm also sensitive or allergic to a ton of scents used in hair products, so that limits what I can try. \n\nSorry to rant all over your wonderful product review. You‚Äôve actually helped with some of my curly hair frustrations because I think I‚Äôm going to try this curl cream.",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\nüê≥ **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\nüîπ **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nüê≥ **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\nüê≥ **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ‚ú® *manifestion* ‚ú® and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured.

So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\nüê≥ **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\nüîµ **SERUM** üîµ\n\nüîπ **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\nüê≥ **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (‚ö†Ô∏èensure the dropper doesn't touch your face‚ö†Ô∏è) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\nüê≥ **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\nüîπ **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\nüê≥ **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\nüê≥ **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\nüîπ **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\nüê≥ **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\nüê≥ **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\nüîµ **MOISTURIZER** üîµ\n\nüîπ**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice;¬†Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\nüê≥ **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\nüê≥ **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\nüîπ **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nüê≥ **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\nüê≥ **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\nüîµ **SUNSCREEN** üîµ\n\nüîπ **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\nüê≥ **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\nüê≥ **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\nüê≥ **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

I have been wanting to do this comparison since the minimalist released its peel, and I finally got the chance to that. I have uploaded a video and images for the comparison but I'll first start with the review.\n\nReview\n\n* *Your skin type-* Sahara desert dry skin\n* *Your current climatic conditions-* Hot af\n* *Your current AM/PM routine-*  \n**AM**\\- Nothing, I only apply sunscreen if have to go out  \n**PM**\\- Ponds cold cream (for my double cleanse), cleanser (Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser), tret (twice a week), ordinary peeling solution (once a month), innisfree jeju volcanic mask (once a month), moisturizer (I have like 4-5 moisturizers that I use)\n* *Your age- 22*\n\n**The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* More than a year\n* *Ingredient List-* Glycolic Acid, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Daucus Carota Sativa Extract, Propanediol, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Potassium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Polysorbate 20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n* *Holy Grail but Will Not Repurchase-* I fucking love it, it made my skin so smooth and my complexion brighter. I never had any skin problems before as such, but it just made everything better. I never experienced any sort of purging or irritation with this peel. Although, I will not be repurchasing it because I paid ‚Çπ1200 for this even though it lasted more than a year. The availability is an issue too.\n\n**Minimalist AHA BHA PHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* 2 times\n* *Ingredient List-* Aloe Vera Juice, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Gluconolactone, Mandelic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lecithin\n* *Holy Grail but Will Repurchase-* I loved it in the very first go, I saw immediate results much like the ordinary. I did not experience any sort of irritation or purging with this either. I honestly don't have much to say because the results are pretty much identical for both.\n\nComparison\n\n**Texture**\n\nAs you can see in the video below, apart from the colour difference the minimalist one a bit flowier than the ordinary. Also, I like the shape of the dropper of the minimalist one, it's pointy rather than the round tip and it looks classier ( at least to my eyes). That is really it when it comes to the texture and the feel of the products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/mobbuo/video/dxwg1bxpdes61/player\n\n**Application**\n\n*note- i forgot to take my before pics, pls forgive a newbie üòîüòîüòî*\n\nI did a half-n-half application of the peels. The immediate thing I noticed was the way they applied, ordinary being thicker is slightly easier to spread because it doesn't drip as much as the minimalist.\n\nAlso, idk what it is about minimalist peel but I had to apply it a tad bit more than its counterpart.\n\nThird, minimalist did not burn AT ALL while the ordinary always burns a little, even after a year of consistent use.\n\nIn the images below you can see my skin right after the application of the peels, the results are very much the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kdr544sdes61.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8425c82498afb958897ee5482979129fdc1c07d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion-** I like both, I don't have a preference for one over the other when it comes to the results. The only thing is that minimalist is cheaper and easily available, so I will go for that one instead of the ordinary.",

    "body": "I tested this recipe across six dozen pretzels in four days. This version nails that classic chewy crust, bronze color, and nostalgic pretzel flavor thanks to diastatic malt powder and a proper lye bath.\n\n\n**Ingredients** (makes 12 pretzels)\n\n**Dough**\n\n575g bread flour\n\n16g diastatic malt powder\n\n315g filtered water\n\n13g dry active yeast\n\n13g kosher salt\n\n20g turbinado sugar\n\n50g unsalted butter, softened\n\n\n**Lye bath**\n\n1200g cold filtered water\n\n4 tbsp food-grade sodium hydroxide (NaOH)\n\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Autolyse (4 hours)\nMix flour, malt powder, and water until a shaggy dough forms. Cover and rest at room temp for 4 hours.\n\n\n2. Add + Knead\nAdd yeast, salt, sugar, and butter. Knead for 15-20 minutes until dough passes the windowpane test. (I use a Bosch Universal Plus mixer - you may need to adjust timing if kneading by hand or using a different mixer.)\n\n\n3. Proof & Fold\n\nProof 60 minutes\n\nFold dough inward on itself\n\nProof again for 30 minutes\n\n\n\n4. Divide + Pre-shape\n\nDivide into 12 pieces\n\nFlatten each into a 4\"x4\" square\n\nRoll tightly into logs (like rolling up a rug)\n\nRest logs for 30 minutes\n\n\n**Preheat oven to 425¬∞f**\n\n\n5. Shape Pretzels (Swabian-style preferred)\nShape with a thick belly and slim arms. Let shaped pretzels rest ~20 minutes while you prep the lye bath and pans. (Note: Placing the shaped pretzels face down helps keep the arms in place during the dipping process.) \n\n\n6. Prep Baking Sheets\nLine 2 half-sheet pans with Silpats. Lightly mist with non-stick spray for insurance. *Pretzels stick to everything!*\n\n\n\n**Lye Bath ‚Äì USE GLOVES AND GOGGLES**\n\nIn a well-ventilated area, add 4 tbsp lye to 1200g cold water. Always add lye to water, not the other way around. Stir with a stainless or silicone utensil until dissolved.\n\nTo dip:\n\nSubmerge each pretzel for 10 seconds\n\nLift from underneath with both hands\n\nLightly blot drips with a towel (don‚Äôt set pretzel down on the towel)\n\nTransfer to lined baking sheet\n\n\nOptional: Salt if serving right away\nUse pretzel salt or coarse flake salt. If storing overnight, skip the salt to avoid moisture absorption and sogginess.\n\n\n\n**Bake**\n\nBake @ 425¬∞F for 7 minutes\n\nRotate pans top to bottom\n\nBake 7 more minutes\n\nCool on a rack for at least 20 minutes\n\n\n\n**To Reheat**\n\nBrush with butter or water and sprinkle salt if desired\n\nAir fryer: 400¬∞F for 2 minutes\n\nOven: 325¬∞F for about 5 minutes\n\n\n\n**Final Tips:**\n\nSilpats are essential. Parchment, foil, or (*gasp*) bare pans = heartbreak.\n\nLye gives the real flavor. No baking soda bath here.\n\nDon‚Äôt salt in advance if storing‚Äîsalt will draw out moisture and make them slimy.\n\nReferences:\n[Adam Ragusea - Bavarian Soft Pretzels](https://youtu.be/VszuPoFKxdQ?si=r56_VrKtNIDothCD)\n\n[Brian Lagerstrom - Soft Pretzels at Home](https://youtu.be/Vs03DIJV7hk?si=sxghmCZnKaudaqVR)\n\n[Ludwig Neulinger via Eater - German Baker Makes 4000 Bavarian Pretzels Daily](https://youtu.be/UyhsLe_704o?si=6ptgaI0mNEyea6Om)",

    "body": "A few weeks back I noticed that there had been more than the normal amount of people commenting that they got *x* on their raws, or they spilled *y* on their raws. That and I spilled about half a bottle of Dry Erase Board Cleanser on my Levi's. Put together, these got me thinking not about the stains or damage to my jeans, but about how these things that were spilled on jeans actually affected the indigo-cotton \"bond\". So I put together an experiment\n\nI explained what I was going to try to the good folks over at [Gustin](https://www.weargustin.com/) and asked if they had any scrap denim lying. They hooked me up sick with scraps from what I believe to be the [Japan Course2](https://www.weargustin.com/store/323). Its a great dark shade of indigo, which I was happy about because this should show if the indigo was disturbed pretty well. It did come with quite a bit of starch in the fabric which might play a part in how this experiment would run. \n\nI went through my house and came up with a bunch of different cleansers. There are a few heavyweights that are missing here, including bleach and OxyClean. They'll be included in a round 2 for sure though. \n\nFor the experiment, the denim was cut into 4\" squares to use as experimental coupons. The bottom half (2\") was saturated with whatever (household cleansers this round), rubbed for a few seconds (with gloves on!), and then placed in a sandwich bag to give a long contact time (amount of time it took me to go and get lunch, eat it, and come back) then removed and allowed to dry a bit (it wasn't dry-dry). Then I used [scrubby brushes](http://imgur.com/74BzPXx) to expose the right side (2\") to abrasion (~1 minute in up/down, left/right, and swirled motions).\n\nI did the bottom half/right half exposures to show 4 scenario's on each coupon:\n\n* Top left - unexposed, unabrased\n\n* Top right - unexposed, abrased\n\n* Bottom left - exposed, unabrased\n\n* Bottom right, exposed, abrased\n\n* **NOTE** on the pictures of the back of the denim, the left side will be the abrased side.\n\nI did it this because it would be easier to compare what something did without having to switch pictures and possible see different things due to some camera settings changing, and to get rid of the coupon as a source of variance in the experiment. \n\nI hung these up and let them dry a couple days in a shed. Then I hit them with another round of abrasion and took both indoor and outdoor pictures. I'm using both bleeding and crocking in this writeup, with crocking referring to mechanical movement of the indigo (scrubbing) and bleeding referring to indigo movement because its in solution and drifts away. So without more boring text...\n\n* **I = Indoor shots, O = Outdoor shots**\n\n* Sample 1 - Control, no water, no abrasion. [I-front](http://imgur.com/KNciKok), [I-back](http://imgur.com/Wt9f7mU), [O-front](http://imgur.com/uUYY0rM), [O-back](http://imgur.com/t2jP9tA). The denim in its unaltered state. Its a great color, not heavy at all. Would make a great pair of jeans.\n\n* Sample 2 - No treatment control, no water, with abrasion. [I-front](http://imgur.com/sGuheLG), [I-back](http://imgur.com/f05NadO), [O-front](http://imgur.com/7RQqXt3), [O-back](http://imgur.com/cAje1CW). Just to check and see if mechanical abrasion did more than just getting the fabric wet. *My thoughts:* Some signs of wear can be seen, with a slight lightening of the indigo color on the abrased side, it's a bit more blue. Some self-crocking can be seen on the weft fiber on the bottom right. Some self-crocking can be seen where the weft shows through as well. \n\n* Sample 3 - No chemical control, water exposure, with abrasion. [I-front](http://imgur.com/kDYoQeo), [I-back](http://imgur.com/eJydlN5), [O-front](http://imgur.com/flteQcN), [O-back](http://imgur.com/4ym5S5k). Testing to see if water alone does just as much as any of the cleansers. *My thoughts:* Water makes these things bleed! There is a definite redistribution of indigo to the weft from the warp fibers. Once you add abrasion you kind of coat where the weft shows through and get a temporary indigo-indigo look. The abrasion also increases the bleed on the weft side. \n\n* Sample 4 - Dry Erase Board Cleaner. [I-front](http://imgur.com/MvcUrix), [I-back](http://imgur.com/hnjggb6), [O-front](http://imgur.com/F8MwG6g), [O-back](http://imgur.com/GR0Ag7H). Active ingredients - Propylene glycol, n-butyl ether. *My thoughts:* Again, lots of redistribution of indigo from weft to warp. Similar to water, but it seems to happen a bit more on the non abrased side of the coupon. \n\n* Sample 5 - 3% Hydrogen Peroxide. [I-front](http://imgur.com/LVsaC90), [I-back](http://imgur.com/im8i2sh), [O-front](http://imgur.com/GVOybkv), [O-back](http://imgur.com/f6uAVfZ). Active ingredients - Hydrogen Peroxide. *My thoughts:* This one surprised me. I expected the oxidative power of the peroxide to do something to either the dye or to the cotton fiber and cause a lot of dye loss. Did not see that. Some redistribution of indigo, but not all that much. \n\n* Sample 6 - Clorox Wipes. [I-front](http://imgur.com/8XGLg4v), [I-back](http://imgur.com/sqqIVu1), [O-front](http://imgur.com/FW0yFKp), [O-back](http://imgur.com/dcnmU85). Active ingredients - Isopropanol, ammonium chlorides. This one I did have to wipe back and forth a bunch, so there will be some mechanical removal of indigo here from the wiping. *My thoughts:* Some indigo redistribution, probably more from crocking than anything. This coupon did see more wear on the abrased and exposed corner than the unexposed side. \n\n* Sample 7 - Toilet Cleaner. [I-front](http://imgur.com/6tjkLrr), [I-back](http://imgur.com/siVcqV1), [O-front](http://imgur.com/zYHXUhU), [O-back](http://imgur.com/Aiq85MZ). Active ingredients - Sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide. *My thoughts:* This one is the money shot. The bleach (hypochlorite) definitely has a huge effect on both the abrased and non-abrased sides, with more of the warp fibers being stripped of indigo when abrasion was applied. \n\n* Sample 8 - Carpet Spot Remover. [I-front](http://imgur.com/8ewPKSG), [I-back](http://imgur.com/G5ptYdr), [O-front](http://imgur.com/a1cygqC), [O-back](http://imgur.com/WCdRSSn). Active ingredients - Hydrogen peroxide, isopropanol. *My thoughts:* This is a foaming carpet cleanser and thus has little water. And it didn't do much to the indigo. There is some bleed, but the fabric looks pretty unchanged.\n\n* Sample 9 - Stainless Steel Cleaner. [I-front](http://imgur.com/3lHWNT5), [I-back](http://imgur.com/lbxZJhz), [O-front](http://imgur.com/bG978Bj), [O-back](http://imgur.com/nrc72TF). Active ingredients - Mineral Oil, synthetic isoparaffinic hydrocarbons, mineral spirits, acetone, methyl acetate, propane. *My thoughts:* I threw this in to get some organic solvents in the experiment. Surprisingly little bleed, but once abrasion was applied there was very definite crocking. \n\n* Sample 10 - Lysol Cleaner. [I-front](http://imgur.com/kmeGIYi), [I-back](http://imgur.com/iZuzk5K), [O-front](http://imgur.com/gWWjQg0), [O-back](http://imgur.com/XDlKsyF). Active ingredients - ammonium chlorides. *My thoughts:* Indigo redistribution from liquid exposure, but little from abrasion. What's interesting here is that there appears to be little fuzzy strings that were also seen with the Clorox wipes. So I'm guessing the ammonium chlorides used in both of these might interact with the cotton fiber causing unraveling perhaps?\n\n* Sample 11 - CLR. [I-front](http://imgur.com/sLEJkKR), [I-back](http://imgur.com/XVZXbty), [O-front](http://imgur.com/V51KXr3), [O-back](http://imgur.com/sR4qeNQ). Active ingredients - Lactic acid, gluconic acid, lauramine oxide. Straight, no dilution. *My thoughts:* Another surprise to me, I thought that the acids in CLR (used straight) would eat through something, but the denim and indigo held up with just a little bit of bleeding. Abrasion caused a lot more redistribution of indigo. \n\n* Sample 12 - Oven Cleaner. [I-front](http://imgur.com/bXxQCHe), [I-back](http://imgur.com/b5rA87f), [O-front](http://imgur.com/q81OWK4), [O-back](http://imgur.com/XJLADxT). Active ingredients - Sodium hydroxide, various alcohols. *My thoughts:* Did surprisingly little. Very little indigo bleed and just a bit of crocking from the brushes. \n\n* Sample 13 - Isopropyl Alcohol. [I-front](http://imgur.com/vDm6ez6), [I-back](http://imgur.com/Xq28HZs), [O-front](http://imgur.com/5qOf62O), [O-back](http://imgur.com/KIOrJNT). Active ingredients - Isopropyl alcohol. *My thoughts:* Some indigo crocking from abrasion, but overall nothing. \n\n* Sample 14 - Nail Polish Remover. [I-front](http://imgur.com/MTtoUFf), [I-back](http://imgur.com/ikls6V5), [O-front](http://imgur.com/Qnk9Kqc), [O-back](http://imgur.com/nXlMAyd). Active ingredients - Ethyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol. *My thoughts:* Some slight bleed, not much else. \n\n* Sample 15 - Ethanol, denatured (95%). [I-front](http://imgur.com/rDVfOKA), [I-back](http://imgur.com/lprOOFq), [O-front](http://imgur.com/YDPkgPJ), [O-back](http://imgur.com/qLyjAZq). Active ingredients - Ethanol. *My thoughts:* A bust. I thought there was enough solving power in almost pure ethanol to pull some indigo off the cotton, but there just wasn't. \n\nAlbum Links for [Inside](https://imgur.com/a/7FSTH) and [Outside](https://imgur.com/a/N0m1y)\n\nSo, what did I come up with? Most common household cleansers don't strip the indigo from your pants. Bleach will. Some might loosen up some indigo and it will eventually come off, but you probably shouldn't worry all that much about it. Water seems to be the common thread when it comes to indigo transfer. Which is something we kind of knew already. \n\nBig ol' bear hug thanks go out to /u/weargustin for hooking me up with fabric to ruin!\n\nTL;DR: I spilled a bunch of household cleansers on denim and took pictures. Albums: [Inside](https://imgur.com/a/7FSTH) and [Outside](https://imgur.com/a/N0m1y). Water makes indigo bleed. \n",

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit? What do they do for YOUR skin?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

(Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them.

    "body": "In Cook Off/Rats, Bain states you have to look for Hydrogen chloride, Caustic soda and Muriatic Acid. Hydrogen chloride is an extremely corrosive and dangerous gas. Toxic hydrochloric acid fumes would be released as soon as it came in contact with water vapor in the air.  \n  \nCombining all three ingredients wouldn't just **not** make a neutral H2O solution, you would be making an extremely acidic solution that would pop and fizz everywhere due to the extreme exothermicity of the reaction.  \n  \nThe heisters are pretty much guaranteed to have their lungs close to completely dissolved from being in a poorly ventilated room during the heist. Caustic soda is hideously corrosive and gets through pretty much anything in a couple of seconds. So although they're not making meth, it's still hideously dangerous. It's definitely not the same thing as just combining baking soda and vinegar.  \n___  \nHCL: Hydrogen Chloride, At room temperature it is a colorless gas, which forms white fumes of hydrochloric acid upon contact with atmospheric humidity.  \n  \nMuriatic Acid: Hydrochloric acid is a clear, colorless, highly pungent solution of hydrogen chloride (HCl) in water. It is a highly corrosive, strong mineral acid with many industrial uses.  \n  \nCaustic Soda: Sodium hydroxide, also known as lye and or caustic soda is an inorganic compound; It is a white solid and highly caustic metallic base and alkali salt which is available in pellets, flakes, granules, and as prepared solutions at a number of different concentrations. Sodium hydroxide forms an approximately 50% (by weight) saturated solution with water.  Sodium hydroxide is soluble in water, ethanol and methanol. This alkali is deliquescent and readily absorbs moisture and carbon dioxide in air.  \n  \nFor example, when cleaning drains, it‚Äôs essential to use only one product and not to mix different chemicals. This is because a reaction between sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) generates salt (sodium sulphate, Na2SO4) and water (H2O). 2 NaOH + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4 + 2 H2O  \n  \nThis might not seem dangerous, but this reaction is highly exothermic, generating a very large amount of heat. This means by mixing a caustic-based drain cleaner (with sodium hydroxide) and or a more acidic product (with sulphuric acid), there‚Äôs the risk that hot water will gush out of the drain and potentially cause severe burns to the face and hands. Its also unlikely that you managed to mix the two products in exact stoichiometric proportions to use all of the NaOH and H2SO4, the water gushing out will not only be potentially boiling, but will contain left-over acid or base, which can worsen the burns.  \n  \n...So here we are, and  we've mixed fucking multiple bucket sized mixtures of chemicals which you are specifically told not to do. Now theres gallons of boiling water on the floor, irreversible lung damage which would occur extremely fast without very good ventilation...A first or second story of a home doesn't seem well ventilated.  \n___  \n  \nBasically all the cops would have to do is let you cook yourselves to death, and that'd only take a few minutes.",

In high school I watched a video of a clean-up crew neutralizing a spill of hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide without measurements.

    "body": "Hey FFA! I'm the moderator over at /r/textiles and recently have had to delete/ban a bunch of spam linking to websites selling bamboo products. I used that to start a discussion in my (minuscule) sub, but was told it would be a good topic to discuss here, too.\n\n[This article](http://www.ecouterre.com/how-eco-friendly-is-bamboo-fabric-really/), while a little biased, gives a good overview on the basics of bamboo fabrics, but I'll summarize/overview here: (the following is a summation of the article interspersed with my own personal knowledge about textile materials and processes)\n\nBamboo is an incredibly renewable resource. It grows fast and with the use of very little resources. Bamboo is a cellulose material, similar to wood. It does contain fibers, but these fibers are very rough and stiff, which means they are not ideal for use next to human skin (in clothes, bedding, etc). But because it is a cellulose material, it can be processed into rayon.\n\nYou may be familiar with rayon materials. Rayon is a synthetic cellulose fiber which is created in a process called wet spinning. Common materials such as polyester or nylon are created in the melt spinning process, where either (1) pellets of the raw material are melted or (2) the material is polymerized at the location of spinning and the fibers are extruded through a spinneret (which you can kind of think of as a shower head) into air where they cool and solidify. This creates smooth fibers which can be shaped in many different forms, but are most often [cylinders](http://imgur.com/bM93eu2). These materials are thermoplastics, which can be re-melted. In the wet spinning process, a material is dissolved in a solvent (usually some type of acid) and is extruded through a spinneret into another solution, where the solvent drops out of the polymer solution and the polymer material is precipitated and solidifies into a fiber. These materials will usually degrade before being melted, which is the reason they are not produced in a melt spinning process. Because wet spun fibers are precipitated, there is a lot more variety to the size and shape of the [fibers](http://imgur.com/I5Hwxkg), which makes them feel more like natural fibers such as [cotton](http://imgur.com/TKKVynO). Rayon, specifically being a cellulose material, winds up being very similar to cotton especially in terms of moisture control. This is a huge advantage over most thermoplastic materials which have very poor moisture-related properties.\n\nThe initial rayon solution can be created using any cellulose material, including wood, paper, cotton, or in the case we're talking about, bamboo. Bamboo is an ideal candidate for this as it can be easily grown and is more renewable than wood coming from trees. However, the wet spinning process requires many harsh solvents and chemicals which can cause harm to factory workers and the environment. The recovery of these chemicals is very low, thus a lot of waste is produced. The textile industry at large is moving away from wet spinning processes wherever possible. (One exception to this trend is in polyaramid fibers, a class which includes many flame-retardant materials as well as kevlar. However, companies are trying to create polyaramids using safer solvents and with a more efficient process, and these fibers are not targeted at the mass-market consumer.) The chemicals required for spinning bamboo rayon, such as disulfide, sulfuric acid, and sodium hydroxide, are not safe. **The renew-ability of bamboo does not cancel out the harm the creation of bamboo rayon does to the environment and to the people involved in the process of creating it**.  \n\nBamboo rayon products are faux-green products, using subtle marketing techniques to trick eco-conscious consumers into thinking it is a 'green' material. \n\nNot to mention, they have terrible abrasion resistance (they pill like crazy!)\n\nIf you're interested in using eco-friendly fabrics, try a nice organic cotton or recycled polyester. Also make sure you're recycling textiles whenever possible. Companies like Patagonia and The North Face will accept old merchandise for recycling. Recycle plastic bottles. If you're replacing the carpet in your home, see if there's a facility near you to recycle your carpets. Don't throw away old clothes! They just rot in landfills. Donate old clothes to companies like Goodwill, or toss them in clothing collection dumpsters you can often find at gas stations or grocery store parking lots. That way, you can ensure clothing which can still be worn will be by someone who needs it, or it will be disposed of properly, often into nonwoven products.

Reduce, reuse, recycle: don't by into faux-green hype.",

All he had to do was look over inventory forms, pointing out spelling errors and inconsistencies before submitting them.\n\nNo, the work wasn‚Äôt bad. It was so easy that Isaac took to doing weapons maintenance on the reloading bench next to the kiosk just to pass the time. In hindsight, it wasn‚Äôt the job that was the problem. It was the clientele.\n\n‚ÄúYou want what?‚Äù he asked.\n\n‚ÄúDet cord. About fifty meters of it.‚Äù\n\nIsaac eyed the woman in front of him. She didn‚Äôt seem like much‚Äìplain facial features and beaten leather armor had conspired to give her the appearance of a perfectly average wanderer.\n\n*Except*, he noted with a slight feeling of dread, *normal wastelanders only ever buy small arms and armor.*\n\nAnd therein laid the problem. A part of Isaac, a very small part of him, wanted to refuse her straight-up. It wanted to ask, ‚Äòwhy exactly do you need detonating cord? What are you hoping to accomplish with it? And why do you keep *staring* like that?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúIs there a problem?‚Äù she asked.\n\nAnd then Isaac pushed the questions aside, as he had done many times before. Whether he liked it or not, the Gun Runners had a reputation to uphold, profit margins to maintain.\n\nAnd a customer was a customer.\n\n‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs fine. We have some in stock, I‚Äôll go get it.‚Äù He paused, then asked, ‚ÄúYou doing some demolitions work?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah, something like that,‚Äù she agreed.\n\n****\n\nThat night, a pair of legionaries set out to patrol the borders of their camp. They do not return.\n\nA search party is organized. Led by the camp‚Äôs veteran decanus, the Legion soldiers find the remains of their patrol. Two bodies hang from hastily-tied nooses. The decanus orders his men to untie the bodies and investigate the area. He is not aware of the six pounds of plastic explosives that lie buried at his feet. His legionaries do not notice that the nooses are not made of rope. Not in time to do anything about it, at least.\n\nThey do not return either.\n\n****\n\nIsaac started to see her more and more as time went on. Each time, she paid upfront in caps, NCR notes, and Legion coins, more money than Isaac had ever seen in his life. Each time, the orders grew bigger and bigger. First she bought an assortment of knives and low-caliber pistols from the vendortron. Then, landmines and a pair of sniper rifles. An oxygen lance. An LMG and two thousand rounds of armor-piercing ammunition.\n\nAnd every now and again, she would talk to him. The vendortron was programmed to sell guns and ammunition. It lacked the higher thought to negotiate more complex transactions.\n\n‚ÄúI need a hundred gallons of sodium hydroxide. I doubt you have any on site, but your suppliers can probably ship something soon.\"\n\n‚ÄúFlamer fuel. Napalm would work too, but I need a lot of it, as quickly as you can get it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI would like to place a bulk order for fragmentation and incendiary grenades. No, the vendortron does not stock enough, *I need more*.‚Äù\n\nEach time, Isaac would hesitate, then nod. He knew he should have been overjoyed at the requests, especially with the generous commission rates the Gun Runners allowed him. But he couldn‚Äôt be happy, even with thousands of caps to console him. Over time, Isaac had learned how to tell the difference between the customers who bought weapons for self-defense, and the idiots who would set out to kill the first thing they saw.\n\nBut her? Isaac felt a sick feeling clawing in his guts. She was the kind of customer he hated the most. She wasn‚Äôt going to go on a mindless rampage and get herself killed by the end of the week. She wasn‚Äôt buying guns and explosives *en masse* for something as base as *defense*. She was the kind of customer who had a *plan*.\n\nAnd if her constant purchases were any indication, she wasn‚Äôt the type to leave weapons on the shelf for long.\n\n‚ÄúWhat is it you do, exactly?‚Äù he asked one day, when his curiosity finally reached a boiling point.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm a courier,‚Äù she said as if it answered everything. He did not ask any more questions after that.\n\nHe noticed something, as if for the first time. There had always been- something, in the Courier‚Äôs gaze. Something terrible and ineffable, that no word or combination of words could completely describe. It shined and laughed behind her eyes, daring Isaac to refuse her requests.\n\nIsaac never took the bait. He took her money and gave her weapons.\n\nIt also occurred to Isaac, only as she was walking away, that he had never seen the Courier blink.\n\n****\n\nThat evening, Fiends attempt an assault on Camp McCarran and the Inner Vegas Area. They are driven back with light casualties on both sides.\n\nThe next day, bounty hunters, mercenaries, and NCR soldiers launch a counterattack on Fiend territory. They find many of the raiders are already dead, including their leaders. Some are crucified to lampposts and the sides of buildings. Many have their limbs, face, and genitals burned and disfigured, from chemicals or intense heat, no one is certain. All of them are missing their eyes.\n\nSeveral miles away in the dead of night, Isaac wakes up drenched in sweat, the faraway sound of laughter echoing to him as if from a dream, or a nightmare.\n\n****\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to stop doing this,‚Äù Isaac muttered.\n\nThe Courier stared at him.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing this anymore,‚Äù he decided. ‚ÄúYou can continue to purchase supplies at the kiosk, but I‚Äôm not selling to you anymore. I just- I can‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nA long moment passed, and Isaac wondered if he had said the wrong-\n\n‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said.\n\nThe Courier walked away.\n\n****\n\nThe next day, a man goes to the Gun Runners‚Äô Outpost. He walks into the main office building for the first time in a long time, taking a resignation form from a sheaf of papers on a desk.\n\nThere is a clock in the room. It reads 8:55\n\nThe man finishes filling out the form. He stands up.\n\nThe clock reads 9:00\n\nSomewhere, a switch is flipped.\n\nThe entire Gun Runners building explodes. The walls bulge as if containing a flood, only to blow themselves apart in a shower of rebar. A great fireball consumes the entire outpost, growing even bigger when it reaches the stores of gunpowder and recently-manufactured missiles. The occupants are turned to ash and less than ash before they realize what happened. Fire rains from the sky for several minutes afterwards.\n\nThe Courier stops by the Crimson Caravan headquarters and purchases several tons of nitroglycerin.\n\nShe receives a discount for ordering in bulk.",

I think that one of the best ways to sum it up comes from \\u\\bit_shuffle: Scientists analyse, engineers synthesis. I have made a nice presentation that describes the overlap between science and engineering, something that I will likely quiz them on.\n\nI understand that the projects that I was outlining involved science, not engineering... I will strive towards outlining problems and allowing students to come up with solutions. So, I will be looking for projects that involve open-ended problems and less scientific testing. The class will include bits of civil, mechanical, chemical (these were the only things that I could think of that would work as chemical engineering projects), and electrical engineering. I may also include some introductory software projects... If either of the projects are included, they will include a paper portion in which the students have to design a continuous process for each of the products. (I have to include some chemical engineering, and distillation isn't very fun without alcohol... is it?)\n\nI may still include at least one of the projects. I may have them use the resulting data from the sugar experiment and tell them that they are to build a bridge using Popsicle sticks and sugar as an adhesive. (The data will indicate which recipe will produce the strongest/most flexible mortar.) Or I might not... what do you guys think? (My main apprehension is that sugar does not have a restoring force, it only distorts, it will not return to its original shape once a force is applied. ... What about gummy bears?)\n\nI will periodically be popping onto this subreddit to ask for more advice. Thanks, everybody, again! \n\n\n> I will be teaching an engineering class starting this fall. The problem is that I am trained as a physicist, not an engineer (my primary job is teaching physics, I didn't lie on my resume or anything). \n\n> I am trying to come up with some chemical engineering projects for the kids (Juniors and Seniors in HS), and I thought that soap making, and candy making might be a good idea. \n\n> With candy, one can test the brittleness of the resulting candy, as well as its ability to test shearing forces, tensile forces and compression forces. These parameters can be mapped against the final temperature of the batch, the amount of sugar, and the starting-final mass of the ingredients (to test how much water has evaporated). I think that this is simple enough (COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS ARE WELCOME, I AM LOOKING FOR HELP!)\n\n> Another (possibly more simple) project might be to make soap. The kids could use different starting oils, and different bases (potassium hydroxide vs. sodium hydroxide) and test the resulting soaps. \n\n> I have many questions: \n\n> First, is this even what engineers do?! \n\n> Are these projects applicable to chemical engineering?\n\n> Are there any other pertinent tests (or more pertinent tests) that would be better for the candy?\n\n> What can be tested with the soap?    (I would like to test its hardness [since different bases and oils are supposed to produce different levels of hardness], as well as its efficacy...  I was thinking of putting a set volume of vegetable oil in a test tube, dissolving a set mass of soap in a set volume of water, mixing, and seeing how much oil was absorbed by the different soaps. Is this a thing that can even be done? \n\n> Thank you!\n",

I ask because your proposals, while interesting, seem very procedural and chemistry/physics experiment-like. There's nothing wrong with that, but for the most part intro to engineering classes tend not to focus on experiment procedure and testing hypotheses. They are generally focused on developing critical thinking about the problem and working through the cost/benefit analysis of the various solutions. What you are proposing are *absolutely* important things for prospective engineers to learn and understand, and I think they'd be interesting, but they're more for a materials science class (in my opinion) than an intro to engineering. \n\nSome additional notable projects I've had:\n\n* Build a small model of a home (really one room) with scaled building materials (strips of wood, small high density foam insulation strips, plexiglass for windows, etc). Balance the material cost (each item is given a cost per unit) for a given square \"footage\" vs the internal temperature rise when the models are placed under a heat lamp for some period of time. This would be part of a lesson on theoretical R-Values of various materials and geometries. (this is more of an architecture class, but is usually cool --if time consuming).\n\n* Build a small sail boat with a very limited set of initial material. Students can buy more material (additional wood, sails, glue, paint, etc) for better performance. Set up a small channel/tub of water and a fan and measure the time it takes for each boat to go a certain distance (and how straight, stable, etc). Set up a minimum time to cross the finish line and award additional points for getting there faster and straighter, and deduct for the cost of additional materials.\n\nI found that for this style project, a catapult is always a favorite.\n \nThere's also the egg-drop challenge. Where you get like two sheets of paper and some tape and a paper clip and have to drop an egg from some height (a 2nd story window for example) and have it land safely. This is a quick one and generally very fun for the students. \n\nI'm not a teacher and I don't know what sort of budget restrictions you have, but these are typical projects that are usually very fun and very helpful in understanding economical design (with your reinforcing those ideas, of course)\n\nEDIT: I should add:\n\n* Free body diagrams - introduce them and have them draw up some examples\n\n* static vs. kinetic friction\n\n* introduction to circuits (basic circuit design showing how circuits work and react to addition of resistors, capacitors, etc).",

        "body": "I would like to offer some random thoughts, as a physicist who does engineering and has been at the front of the classroom now and then.\n\nThe main distinction between the natural sciences and engineering education is the different emphases on \"analytic\" versus \"synthetic\" thinking.  Both scientists and engineers use both modes of thinking, but the scientist is oriented toward analysis as the final pathway to their objective, while the engineer is oriented toward synthesis as the final pathway for their objective.\n\nAs a natural scientist, I have no \"goal.\"  In fact, I need to carefully set aside what I \"expect\" or \"want\" to happen.  My only interest is constructing the model of what the natural system does.\n\nAs an engineer, analysis is simply an intermediate step to guide my synthesis of the desired system.  I need to know how the parts behave, to get the system to do or be what I want.\n\nYour projects are exercises in \"analytical\" thought.  You have already channeled the students into a set manufacturing process (for candy or soap, etc.)  And your intent is to test the natural properties of the products.  You have also selected the parameters to test.  You don't have open-ended paths to a goal, you have fixed paths to an analysis result.\n\nVery constrained to analytical thinking.\n\nFor an engineering class, you need open-ended \"synthetic\" problems.  A typical introductory engineering class exercise is...\n\n\"Transport this 10 gram weight from one classroom desk to another classroom desk using the string, sticks, and assorted hardware parts provided.\"\n\nThat will immediately drive the students to think about tension, torque, mass, momentum... and you won't even have to motivate them to start trying the equations.  It is a design problem.  It requires synthetic thinking.  It will make physics class come alive for them.\n\nIn fact, you can wait a semester, until the students have had some electricity and magnetism... change the parts in the box... and assign the very same assignment in engineering class... and they'll still love it, because they will have a whole new set of approaches to move the 10g weight to the next desk, based on motors and batteries or solar panels or whatever you provide.\n\nChemical engineering is a very difficult subject to teach without apparatus that most high schools won't have.\n\nHowever, if a chemical engineering topic is what is required, I think separation of a mix of hydrocarbons would be a better choice.  Mix motor oil, gasoline, cyclohexane, benzene, and others together into a sludge, and challenge the students to separate a component out.  They will have to learn to apply heat in a controlled way, and design and adjust a distillation column.  It is less open-ended than electronic or mechanical projects though, because it is really just hacking glassware.\n\nYou simply say \"Get me as much octane from this as you can,\" hand them a beaker of the mix, and turn them loose.\n\nNow you see, any chemical engineering project... is going to require some way to verify the student's measurements are correct... did they really get you octane?  Or just a crappy mix of aromatics?  Tricky.\n\nBut I can see right off if they got the 10g weight onto the next desk.\n\nAnd this leads me to my next suggestion.\n\nIf you are a physicist, then you most certainly taught your students the scientific method.  You taught them that the scientific method is:\n\nFormation of a Hypothesis (sometimes inspired by an Observation).\n\nPerforming a passive Observation, or...\n\nPerforming an experimental Action and Observing the outcome followed by...\n\nForming a Conclusion based on your collected evidence.\n\nSo Hypothesis, Observation, Action, and Conclusion are linked.  The conclusion may or may not support or rule out the hypothesis completely, so you may have to iterate through the method again, forming new hypotheses and obtaining multiple conclusions until the original hypothesis is resolved.\n\n\nWhat you must do in your engineering class is set out the notion of the engineering process:\n\nEstablishing requirements. (What is needed or desired.)\n\nDesigning a solution.  (Employing scientific knowns to guide design choices, and deciding what models or properties of components should be obtained using the scientific method to resolve ambiguous design choices.)\n\nImplementing the solution.  (Executing the assembly of parts and performing manufacturing of the prototype.)\n\nTest and Evaluation.  (Two questions:  Did the design perform as expected?  Did the design satisfy the requirements?  These are distinct questions with distinct answers that guide what we, as engineers, will do next.)\n\nThe outcome of the test and evaluation step determines if you need to return to the design phase, the implementation phase, or go back even further to consider what are feasible requirements.\n\nSo in physics class, you can have the students write lab reports using the traditional sections corresponding to hypothesis, experimental action, observation, and conclusion, you can have the students write their engineering lab reports, describing the requirements, design, implementation process, and test and evaluation results.\n\nBeat the hell out of them.",

    "body": " This is my first review on here, so I'm still trying to find my style and all that but I hope to post more reviews in the future!\n\nAnyway, onto the product.\n\n**WHY I BOUGHT IT**\n\nI bought this based upon recommendations from this sub, where I have heard people rave about it, as well as over on r/SkincareAddiction as well. This was also recommended by Cyrille Laurent - he absolutely adores this moisturiser and constantly raves about it. If you don't know who he is, he's still fairly small on Youtube and Instagram and he has a Biology PhD, so his videos and content tends to focus on what is supported by science. I find him a really valuable source of information alongside LabMuffin, Dr Ginza, The Eco Well and Skinchemy. I was looking for a new moisturiser at the time and this seemed to fit the bill really well.\n\n**MY SKIN TYPE/CONCERNS**\n\nI have pretty dry skin, and I do tend to get quite sweaty from exercise as well. I'm prone to blackheads and clogged pores on my nose, and I also get some closed comedones on my chin. I'm sensitive to fragrance and essential oils as they tend to cause some stinging and and cause acne.\n\n**HOW/WHERE I BOUGHT IT**\n\nAs I live in the UK, this is available at Boots (basically a drugstore) for ¬£19.50 for 40g, which is a little pricey but honestly not too bad as I didn't have to pay shipping.\n\n**HOW LONG I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR**\n\nI've been using this for 3 1/2 weeks, which I think is pretty much long enough for a moisturiser. I patch-tested this first as well.\n\n**INGREDIENTS LIST**\n\n*Water/Aqua, Glycerin, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Cyclopentasiloxane, Squalane, Trisiloxane, Dimethicone, PEG-3 Dimethicone, Allantoin, Magnesium Sulfate, Butylene Glycol, Isostearyl Glyceryl Ether, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Succinic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Bis-Methoxypropylamido Isodocosane, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Tocopherol, Methylparaben*\n\nIt does contain eucalyptus extract, which could contain some fragrant components, however it is low down on the ingredients list - just something to be aware of if you have very sensitive skin and tend to avoid all fragrant extracts and hydrosols.\n\nThe eucalyptus extract is [reported by the manufacturer KAO](https://web.kao.com/sg/curel/ceramide_care/) as being able to boost the skin's production of ceramides.\n\nIt contains a pseudoceramide (*Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide),* which tbh I trust more than improperly formulated ceramides, as well as allantoin, a great soothing ingredient at a concentration of 0.5%. Squalane and tocopherol as well as the classic humectant glycerin are also included. This does contain silicones, which is something to be mindful of, however my skin really enjoys the texture of silicone-containing products and the smoothing effect.\n\n**SCENT**\n\nAs one should expect, not much scent aside from a slight chemical-ish scent which disappears extremely quickly.\n\n**TEXTURE**\n\nThe texture of this is very light and fluffy, yet slightly wet. Not liquid at all, so it is very easy to scoop out from the packaging. On your skin, as you apply it it quickly sinks in very smoothly and feels invisible on the skin. Not sticky at all (yay!)\n\n**EXPERIENCE/EFFECTS**\n\nI have seen a massive difference in the plumpness and hydration since using this cream. My skin is so much plumper and less dehydrated. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels smooth and soft, practically glowing. Honestly, I'm not sure I could wish for more in a moisturiser - it goes above and beyond to do the job and keep your skin hydrated.\n\nIt hasn't broken me out, irritated my skin OR clogged my pores (a win in my book!)\n\n**OVERALL THOUGHTS**\n\nHonestly, I couldn't rave about this moisturiser any more. My skin has never felt so good - I didn't even realise how dry and dehydrated my skin was until I started using this.\n\nI would probably suggest this to dry and normal skin types looking for good hydration but a light and elegant texture. This might work for combo skin in the colder/drier months as well.\n\nThis is definitely a HG product for me - I'm not sure what other moisturisers could top this, but maybe I'll try some more one day.\n\n**10/10 - I recommend this product if you want a light and fluffy texture, fragrance-free, very hydrating, overall plumping effect!**",

It's comparatively cheap to other test kits, provides results with a reasonable standard deviation, is easy to read, and does make a difference in this hobby. Keep buying them my dudes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you read nothing else in this post, please understand that the chemicals used in these test kits vary from \"oof this makes my skin itchy\" to \"I now need 2-5 years of medical treatment\". Please use **extreme** caution with the handling and storage of this kit. Do not rush, rinse everything throughly after use, and please keep a print out of the booklet available to you at all times. In the event of ingestion, exposure, accidental contamination of your tank, etc, the booklet and related websites give detailed instructions on how to handle a very scary situation,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional information is available on [API's website](https://apifishcare.com/product/freshwater-master-test-kit#:~:text=The%20API%C2%AE%20FRESHWATER%20MASTER,ammonia%2C%20nitrite%2C%20and%20nitrate) where extensive information is listed via their information sheets. Scroll down and read the PDF links.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Overview\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ammonia test uses a modified version of the Berthelot method to determine Total Available Nitrogen (TAN). Because of this test's inability to determine chill ammonia and deadly ammonia, you really have to know your tank's ph, temp, and TDS to have a really accurate result. It really doesn't matter, though. the difference between .01ppm and .25ppm is negligible. In a laboratory, a machine is used to determine the exact level of coloration. For us? We get a weirdly spaced gradient that we have to guess on. For me it is impossible because of my colorblindness lmao. That is honestly the difference between higher end test kits. The number of colors on a paper for you to compare to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Chemicals\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmmonia bottle 1:\n\n[Sodium nitroprusside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitroprusside): cyanide salts, Iron salts, soluble, as Fe. Used as a catalyst to improve the saturation of indophenol blue (the color that shows up). Mad poisonous. Heavily regulated. Bad news if ingested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Polyethylene glycol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol): I couldn't find a tangible reason why it's in there. My guess is it's a stabilizer OR a failsafe to get you to shit your brains out if ingested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sodium salicylate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_salicylate#cite_note-9): The main squeeze.  Not safe under a lot of conditions. Regulated. Watch out. The alternative name to Berthelot Method is Salicylate Method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmmonia bottle 2:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sodium hydroxide](https://g.co/kgs/7jMRqK): AKA Lye. Super caustic, wouldn't interact with it in solid form. Eats skin like I eat steak burritos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSodium hypochlorite....literally bleach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSodium hypochlorite pentahydrate (bleach but with 5 water molecules)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What the hell is going on\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Ammonia compounds react with hypochlorite to form monochloramine.\n2. The monochloramine then reacts with salicylate to form 5-aminosalicylate.\n3. Oxidation of 5-aminosalicylate is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, nitroprusside (also called nitroferricyanide), which results in the formation of indosalicylate, a blue-colored compound. The blue color is masked by the yellow color (from excess nitroprusside) causing a green-colored solution. The intensity of the resulting green color is directly proportional to the ammonia concentration in the sample.\n\n[Source](https://www.hach.com/parameters/ammonia?_bt=513182708104&_bk=ammonia%20salicylate%20method&_bm=p&_bn=g&utm_id=go_cmp-12706111160_adg-118939691485_ad-513182708104_kwd-770518219356_dev-c_ext-_prd-&utm_source=google&gclid=Cj0KCQjw08aYBhDlARIsAA_gb0dFnhN4ERw4QxsLkVvbR0doVrRy8BGiUwCCOTSyMZaYPU5OdBHpcxwaAs8SEALw_wcB)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had to dig around for hours to find actual info on this. Is it useful? Not really. I think it's neat, and this was a fun way to spend my day off. I like to know whats happening and I hope this is a googleable result for someone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a good day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to change formatting....the bar was right there and i still used mobile format lmao",

    "body": "Review day 2/7\nI've been a pimple patch skeptic for years and I didn't think it was a necessity to buy them (I still don't think you need them but they do help). However, the past two years I noticed that when I do break out it's huge and it takes weeks to heal which sucks. So I decided to buy 4 different brands of pimple patches to determine which ones my skin (which ranges from combo, normal and dry depending on the season) likes the best . I tested them all with the help of some of my friends that have other skin concerns(sensitive acne prone, super oily acne prone, combo dehydrated, dry acne prone, and oily dehydrated skin) \n\nBefore I do start pimple patches should be applied after cleansing when your face is dry or else it won't work well. I'll try to go in depth as possible. \n\nA‚ÄôPIEU NonCo Tea Tree Spot Patch\nThis patch is thin, clear, and almost unnoticeable on the skin. I've worn these out several times and the only times people noticed was when i was facing a certain way in the light. This is a medicated acne patch. It sticks very well (i had it on my face for 4 days because I forgot I had it there and despite all of my daily activities and my cities strange weather patterns it stayed on). It just really adheres to your skin nicely and imo easy to remove off. It contains tee tree oil and salicylic. If you have a sensitivity to either of these items I'd pass. You won't see stuff come out at least for me but it reduces the size These are best used for 'normal' acne. These are just a good basic if you don't have severe acne problems. \n\nIngredients:\nAcrylates Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Water, Alcohol, Melaleuca Alternofolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Salicylic Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Allantion, Phytosphingosine, Polysorbate 80, Methylparaben\n\nOn yesstyle you can get the 8+2 pack so you get 120 patches for $7CAD RRS sells them too. Any skin type can use these. \n\n\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch\n A cult fave and the first one I tried out. These patches are made from hydrocolloid which is used in hospitals to treat wounds and prevent infections. They are around the same thickness as the mentholatum patches aka their thicker than expected but not super thick. They are a white colour so its noticeable if you walk out in it. Where this product beats the a'pieu patches is overnight your pimple will be popped and you can see the gunk clearly, it also has more protective features. It really does stay still and doesn't budge If you have oily acne prone skin I recommend this one. They also have three different sizes the third size is perfect for those tiny spots you get. These also work on non severe white heads as well as my friend found out. \n\nIngredients:\nCellulose gum, Styrene Isoprene Styrene Block Copolymer, Polysobutylene, Petroleum Resin, Polyurethane Film, Liquid Paraffin, Tetrakis Methane\n\nComes with 24 patches roughly $5 CAD on yesstyle which u think is like $\t3 something USD. Anybody acne prone skin I think may like it but anyone else can use them too. \n\nAcropass Trouble Cure\n \nThese don't just heal pimples above the skin it goes underneath and fights them too. The patches are made with little microneedles from Niacinamide and Hyaluronic acid serum. They are so tiny I can't see them at all. It has a similar pops a hole in the pimple and sends the serum deeper into the spot. The patches come with two steps. Step one is cleansing the area with a cotton swab filled with tea treatments and salicylic acid. Step two is the serum. Apparently its meant for all types of acne according to soko glam. They are super thick night time use only and don't leave on for more than 8 hours since it started to sting after that. Really good for people suffering with serious acne concern it is very pricey so it's down on my list. \n\nIngredients:\nStep 1 \n\nEthanol, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf oil, Salicyc Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nStep 2\n\nHydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Oligopeptide-76, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThe box comes enough with only 6 uses and it's $18 USD on Soko Glam so I don't think it's worth it my friend that suffers from cyst and hormonal acne loves it and will continue to splurge on it. It's also good if you have dry skin with break outs. \n\n \nMentholatum Acnes Acne Patch \n\nThey are medicated time so it helps stop the growth of the bacteria while healing it at the same time. These patches are amazing for cyst and prevents your cyst becoming infected. They are kind of thick and are kinda opaque so it's noticeable when you wear them. Also if you have oily skin just to warn you they move around a bit but on dry skin it stays on better than the cosrx. Mine came with this little tweezer applicator so that's a plus if sanitation is big for you. Gave it to my younger sister a few days before her prom and she had to constantly put new ones on since it would just slide off her skin. Some people prefer this one but it was just meh imo. \n\n36 pieces for $8CAD if you're prone to cist and have combo, normal or dry skin this should work. \n\nHope this was a little helpful! \n",

I also find that they're the most thin and discreet patches that I've come across as well. I've used both the ones in the green box and blue box. I think the only difference between the two may just be the size. The green has two different sizes whereas the blue has just the small size. I think the thickness is the same but I'm not 100% certain on that. I did recently purchase the Cosrx invisible ones (black label) but I haven't gotten round to testing them out to see if they're better than the Mentolatum ones. I've also used Nexcare before and I hate them. They're super thick, not discreet at all and have almost zero sticking power that it's frustrating.

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here‚Äôs a looong review post of many of the products I‚Äôve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I‚Äôm a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don‚Äôt wear makeup on a daily ‚Äì or even weekly ‚Äì basis. I‚Äôve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I‚Äôm in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I‚Äôm average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I‚Äôve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently‚Ä¶ boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it‚Äôs fine. This is many people‚Äôs holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It‚Äôs affordable, nice pump, doesn‚Äôt try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don‚Äôt love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It‚Äôs standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn‚Äôt remove all makeup, it‚Äôs as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don‚Äôt leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that‚Äôs fine, so I don‚Äôt know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it‚Äôs important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they‚Äôre pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it‚Äôs a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that‚Äôs about it. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula‚Äôs Choice wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don‚Äôt think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It‚Äôs an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don‚Äôt have the data. I hope it is, though. I‚Äôm also worried that it‚Äôll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It‚Äôs one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time‚Ä¶ And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN‚Äôs products, so beware. Just because it says it‚Äôs natural fragrance, doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt mess with your skin. The word ‚Äúnatural‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we‚Äôve found we‚Äôre all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It‚Äôs a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn‚Äôt use it during the daytime. I‚Äôm not currently using it, because I‚Äôm trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn‚Äôt really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don‚Äôt know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol‚Äô retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn‚Äôt released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it‚Äôs even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôll wait a while longer to see if there‚Äôs any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn‚Äôt really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it‚Äôs a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn‚Äôt contain any preservatives. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin‚Äô. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You‚Äôve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you‚Äôre from Northern Europe. Anyway, it‚Äôs a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it‚Äôs great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don‚Äôt want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It‚Äôs called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you‚Äôre allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you‚Äôre allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It‚Äôs my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I‚Äôm too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It‚Äôs gel-like, but it doesn‚Äôt melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn‚Äôt seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn‚Äôt sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don‚Äôt buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn‚Äôt all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it‚Äôs called a night mask, it‚Äôs a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this‚Ä¶ right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don‚Äôt know. My skin is normal, so I don‚Äôt really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I‚Äôd appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I‚Äôve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don‚Äôt really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention‚Ä¶ It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it‚Äôs bad for your skin. Anyway, it‚Äôs an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because‚Ä¶ I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I‚Äôll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it‚Äôs 10% glycolic acid it‚Äôs still very gentle, and that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven‚Äôt used it recently because I‚Äôm using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn‚Äôt ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I‚Äôm quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don‚Äôt need one, I‚Äôm just so extra. It‚Äôs a HG product for me, because it‚Äôs the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it‚Äôs great if you have sturdy skin, and you‚Äôre lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won‚Äôt oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of‚Ä¶ dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it‚Äôs not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you‚Äôre looking for a vitamin c product. It‚Äôs perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won‚Äôt cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn‚Äôt make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: ‚Ä¶why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there‚Äôs that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven‚Äôt seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven‚Äôt been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don‚Äôt particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I‚Äôll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so‚Ä¶\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Ysth√©al intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as ‚ÄúAv√®ne RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream‚Äù, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don‚Äôt know what retinaldehyde is, well, it‚Äôs one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol √† retinaldehyde √† retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Av√®ne‚Äôs lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don‚Äôt have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I‚Äôm only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I‚Äôve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you‚Äôre 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn‚Äôt seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They‚Äôve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you‚Äôre pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8‚Äôs retinaldehyde products, plus it was Av√®ne that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "\n\nWell, howdy folks,\n\n\nA certain number of you astute readers made note that I was talking with our long-forlorn Agency buddies, and East Coast inhabitants, Agents Rack and Ruin.\n\n\nBut nothing seemed to have come of it.\n\n\nLike I tell you guys everything‚Ä¶\n\n\nWell, now it can be said.\n\n\nAgents Rack and Ruin, on Federal Orders, picked me up at my home and speedily whisked me away from kith and kin to White Sands Missile Range here in this very same state where I have established residence.\n\n\nNow, White Sands Missile Range is fairly famous. It was the Trinity Test site for the first fission nuclear device. It is also a significant location in the history of space exploration and missile development. Here are some interesting facts about WSMR:\n\n\n\n1.\tRocket testing: WSMR is one of the largest military bases in the United States, spanning over 3,200 square miles. It's been used for rocket testing and development since the 1940s, playing a crucial role in the early years of space exploration.\n\n\n2.\tV-2 rocket tests: In the late 1940s, WSMR was used to test captured German V-2 rockets, which were developed during World War II. The U.S. Army used these tests to understand the technology and develop their own ballistic missiles.\n\n\n3.\tPioneer of spaceflight: In 1949, WSMR launched the first U.S. guided missile into space, a V-2 rocket carrying a small payload into an altitude of 250 miles (400 km).\n\n\n4.\tEarly ICBM development: WSMR was also used to test early Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), including the Atlas and Titan rockets, which were developed in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\n5.\tApollo missions: In the 1960s, WSMR played a crucial role in the development of the Apollo program, with NASA using the range to test and simulate lunar landing conditions.\n\n\n6.\tCurrent activities: Today, WSMR is still an active military base, conducting various tests and operations for the U.S. Army and other government agencies. It's also home to several military units and research centers focused on missile defense and space technology.\n\n\n7.\tNational Historic Landmark: In 2001, WSMR was designated as a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of Defense, recognizing its significant contributions to the country's space and missile programs.\n\n\nIts rich history has played a significant role in shaping our understanding of space exploration and missile technology.\n\n\nAnd I was brought there specifically to, as you might have guessed, blow shit up.\n\n\nHowever, they would not tell me why.\n\n\nPlus, my usual contracts were worth bupkis here. They wanted to pay me over 50% more.\n\n\nThose chapped bastards.\n\n\nAnyways.\n\n\nOver dinner the first day, I was handed a number of sheets. On these sheets were alphabetized lists of an extraordinary number of explosives. \n\n\nI hesitate to add those here, but even I was amazed at the number and diversity of boom-products they had interest in down here. \n\n\nThose who glaze over at long lists, *mea culpa*, just jog ahead a few pages.

was the most familiar. \n\n\nThis took a bit of time.\n\n\nI was like a kid in a candy store. \n\n\nWhat to choose? What to choose?\n\n\nAnd, for what purpose?\n\n\nThey finally relented and explained that they were building a catalog of both deflagrating and detonating explosives, excluding nuclear devices. \n\n\nDamn.\n\n\nAnyways, there was a rich supply of nicely made pine boxes, cubes all, measuring exactly one meter on a side, smoothly sanded and vicariously varnished.\n\n\n\nA 1-meter cube has the volume of one cubic meter, 1 m^3 or 1 *stere*.\n\n\nWho says reading this stuff is not educational?\n\n\nThe idea was to load each cube with a certain set number of explosives, initiate the device and record the results in some sort or another of a catalog. \n\n\nI thought this was a highly niftiferous idea. \n\n\nBut what was the ‚Äúcertain set amount of explosive‚Äù going to be? One kilogram of C-4 is going to behave wildly differently than one kilogram of Torpex or 1 kilogram of volatilized plain-old petrol (gasoline). \n\n\nIt is all about energy density, Fanboys and Girls. \n\n\nOddly enough, gasoline is ridiculously energy dense. Other well-known explosives, such as black powder, are much further down the scale. \n\n\n‚ÄúOh, and what scale is that?‚Äù I asked at a particularly well-attended breakfast meeting.\n\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the scale you and your associate scientists are going to create here in the next few weeks‚Äù, General Gottschalk explained. \n\n\nI gave a brief objection: ‚ÄúGeneral there are two major categories of explosives (if one excludes nuclear): deflagrating and detonating. In the latter, there are two further major categories, high explosives and low explosives. High explosives are further divided into initiating, or primary, high explosives and secondary high explosives.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúQuite correct, Herr Doctor,‚Äù he smiled knowing of my Germanic background. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you fine folks are all here‚Ä¶to cut through all the legalistic bullshit and come up with a new and improved physical and chemical classification of all known, save nuclear, explosives.‚Äù \n\n\nThere was some giggling (from Doctors of Detonics, no less. Honestly.), but a buzz went up and there was an immediate schism between the physical and the chemical scientists. \n\n\n\nGeneral Dr. Gottschalk smiled broadly and was heard to exclaim ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I like to hear: bickering and arguing before breakfast.‚Äù\n\n\nAll of us, some 75 pax, were given our marching orders.\n\n\nThere were about 5 or 6 others that the General weeded out of the breakfast meeting and had us ensconced in a very private, very secure room just off the main drag. I was even offered one of the general‚Äôs own cigars from his private stock. \n\n\n‚ÄúDoctor Rock‚Äù, he addressed me. \n\n\n‚ÄúRock is fine, General Gottschalk.‚Äù, I replied. \n\n\n‚ÄúThen call me Tom‚Äù, he smiled. ‚ÄúCivilians‚Ä¶‚Äù he snorted. \n\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a few more than a couple of patents regarding explosives, is that correct?‚Äù He asked.\n\n\n‚ÄúRack and Ruin must not be doing their jobs,‚Äù I smiled and exhaled a large cloud of blue smoke, ‚ÄúElse they‚Äôd have told you I hold explosive patents in 6 countries, including Russia‚Ä¶which given the Ukraine situation, I usually don‚Äôt mention too loudly.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù, he smiled back. ‚ÄúI was going to bounce you off the team because of all your time in Russia. But then the agents made note to me of the rest of your CV. Christ Almighty! Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Greenland, Australia, the South Fucking Pole! Hell, it‚Äôd be easier to list the countries where you haven‚Äôt worked.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúIf it possibly has oil and is a particularly nasty place, I‚Äôve been there.‚Äù I reassured him. \n\n\n‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Tom smiled back through a blue haze of his own. ‚ÄúYou are the Team Leader here. This group all hold patents on explosives or explosive processes. We want you and your team, aside from the three or four products with which you are most familiar, to produce something ‚Äònovel‚Äô. There will be an extremely healthy honorarium for developments in sectors that will be delineated later.‚Äù\n\n\n\nI was really warming to the idea of being back on the government dole and having all sorts of access to fun and severely reactive compounds. Plus, I would even get a spate of royalties from my various patents. \n\n\nAlso, I was accosted by Agents Rack and Ruin in our VIP bivouac this night.\n\n\nThey knew I had at least a half-dozen flasks of various caliber potent potables; and since this was a military base, drinking was more or less *verboten*, so they sought me out as their rescuing angel. \n\n\n‚ÄúMy dear Agents‚Äù, I said as I laid out the 8 or so flasks of various vintages, ‚ÄúBe of good cheer. You know I‚Äôm a Team Leader now and that certain ethyl alcohol compounds exhibit the most unusual explosive properties. In fact, I have already requisitioned several cases of Glacial EtOh (ethyl alcohol) as well as some specific ‚Äôblends‚Äô.‚Äù\n\n\nAgents Rack and Ruin may not be lettered scientists, but they noticed that little bit of subterfuge in mere seconds. \n\n\n‚ÄúWe bow once again to your expertise‚Äù, agent Rack stated. \n\n\nAgent Ruin nodded in deep agreement. \n\n\nWith that, and the usual disbursement of cigars, Agents Rack and Ruin returned from a brief hiatus with what appeared to be several items for my personal and professional use. \n\n\nThey took my old laptop, and had it upgraded to the latest in Mil Spec tech. Encrypted, solid-state, internal 10 TB; all the latest bells and whistles that I have no idea how to use or even why they‚Äôre. But it‚Äôs faster than greased lightning, security up the yin-yang, grabs and hangs on to the weakest of Wi-Fi signals; it is probably faster than my home lash-up. All on-board up to date programs that I extensively use in a battle-hardened titanium case. \n\n\nI like having all the toys to play with once again. \n\n\nThere were some other presents welcoming me back to ‚ÄúMostly inactive but sometimes somewhat active service‚Äù, such as a finely honed Marine Corps. Kabar knife, and a really nifty pen and pencil set, courtesy of NASA.\n\n\nI made no comments about NASA being non-military. \n\n\nWith that, we played a few hands of Loser‚Äôs Poker, and it was lights out at a decently proper hour. \n\n\nI may be attached to the US military-industrial complex, but I still need my shuteye. \n\n\nThe next morning, dawning clear and ridiculously bright, as so often happens hereabouts when there are no rainclouds for what seemed several parsecs. I went for my usual ablutions, then off to the Mess Hall for chow (Wow. I sound *so* military!), a smoke and then a quick constitutional over to the labs where my group and I were to do some serious braining and produce something exceedingly nasty for our Uncle Sam. \n\n\nAgents Rack and Ruin were front and center. \n\n\n‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this above your pay grade?‚Äù I inquired. \n\n\n‚ÄúNot at all‚Äù, Agent Rack informed me. In fact, because of their constant attachment to me and my global wanderings, they‚Äôve both been promoted to Spook Class 1-A or something equally evil and were there to both monitor and audit what we were doing. \n  \n\n‚ÄúLook‚Äù, I said, in no uncertain terms, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm supposed to teach this little Synapse-o-thon as a class, I want immediate tenure, coffee, and a raise.‚Äù\n\n\nI had tenure for as long as I wanted to hang around the base, a nice little pay-raise (based on results‚Ä¶they get you every time) and a fresh coffee within a half-hour. \n\n\n‚ÄúJust leave the pot‚Äù, I told the Stewards. They later relayed to me that they appreciated that and saved them all that legwork. \n\n\nWe went through a *lot* of coffee. \n\n\nAfter we had our preferred explosives chosen, we broke into groups and worked on the idea of ‚Äúsomething new‚Äù. \n\n\nI was the only one with any history with binary explosives and held their rapt attention when I mentioned a certain Moldavian concoction that nearly did me in one time back in India. \n\n\nThey wanted to explore the world of binaries, and I gave them the green light and told them to hit the research pages hard. \n\n\nMe, on the other hand, had a different idea. \n\n\n‚ÄúBinaries? Bah! Let us do trinary explosives. \n\n\nNot one, nor two, but *three* active ingredients. \n\n\nBinary explosives are pre-packaged products consisting of two separate components, usually an oxidizer like ammonium nitrate and a fuel such as aluminum or another metal. Examples of common binary explosives include Oxyliquit (liquid oxygen/combustible powder), ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil), Kinestik (an old favorite composed of ammonium nitrate/nitromethane), Tannerite and ammonal (ammonium nitrate/aluminum), and FIXOR (nitroethane/physical sensitizer).\n\n\nNow, there is this old saw about the ‚ÄúExplosive Triangle‚Äù or the three conditions that must be met before explosions can be initiated. These are, ‚ÄúFuel,‚Äù ‚ÄúIgnition source‚Äù, and ‚ÄúOxygen‚Äù. \n\n\nTriangle.\n\n\nThree components.\n\n\nTrinary explosive or ternary explosive‚Ä¶\n\n\nRubbing hands together evilly whilst twirling the ol‚Äô moustache‚Ä¶\n\n \nTernary explosives, such as the ones with compositions of the \"hexolite\" type have been described in which a part of the hexogen is replaced by dinitroglycoluril. The modified hexolites obtained have enhanced shattering properties and are less expensive than conventional hexolites containing the same proportion of trinitrotoluene. Fine octogen and/or hexo-octo, as well as conventional hexolite modifiers, can be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\n\nThe compositions have the same applications as conventional hexolites, contains nitro-aromatic hydrocarbons. If mixed with reducing agents, including hydrides, sulfides, and nitrides, may begin a vigorous reaction that culminates in a detonation. They may explode in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide even in the presence of water or suitable organic solvents. They are a mixture of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and trinitrotoluene (TNT). Also includes \"Composition B\". \n\n\nThey just might explode under prolonged exposure to heat. The primary hazard is the blast effect of an instantaneous explosion, and not flying projectiles and fragments. Mixed with up to 15% water, the water is used to deactivate the mixture to lessen the explosion hazard.\n\n\nBut only for those faint of heart. \n\n\nI decided on good old Thermite as an initiator. It has a peak of 4,500^0 F. melting point would assure ignition of the most recalcitrant secondaries and would also provide for a thermally sterile environment into which I can introduce the oxidizer(s) and fuel(s). \n\n\nNow what better oxidizer than good old Liquid Oxygen? It is the ultimate oxidizer but has the added value of being cryogenic. With thermite‚Äôs 4,500^0 F temperature and LOX being happy around ‚àí297.33 ¬∞F, that is nearly 5,000^0 F of thermal gradient with which I can play. \n\n\nBut what to use as fuel? \n\n\nLook back to the list‚Ä¶\n\n  \nI am going to go with Composition-4 for the first trails. I know this stuff; it is stable as all get-out and cheaper than a night on the town. Plus, its energy density is rather high, so coupled with the other two parts of the equation, it should be a winner, all-round.\n\n\nWe shall ‚ÄúC-4‚Äù ourselves‚Ä¶\n\n\nDuring the intervening weeks, we blew the living shit out of over 11,000 pine cubes. There were some real surprises, such that my patented ‚ÄúSedate Nitro‚Äù had a higher density value and was 45% less shock reactive than regular old nitroglycerine. \n\n\nThe military took immediate interest in my patent, and I sold them the rights to my discovery at the low-low bargain basement price of [a serious chunk of change which fully 50% will go to endow a chair in geology at some oily university somewhere in the US].\n\nSo now they can quit calling me a money-grubbing, cigar-chomping, bourbon-slurping mercenary.\n\nI mean, I don‚Äôt slurp bourbon‚Ä¶\n\n\nThere were all sorts of hijinks with NI3, or Nitrogen Triiodide. It‚Äôs the mixture of the ‚ÄúPurple Haze‚Äù fame. When wet, paint it anywhere and it‚Äôs safe. When it dries, it‚Äôs extraordinarily shock sensitive and deflagrates into a large *poof* of purple smoke and bemused targets. \n\n\nWe also synthesized XeCL4 or Xenon Tetrachloride. Incredibly, ridiculously shock sensitive, but so poorly bonded, when it initiates, there‚Äôs just a flash of light (as we give rise to freed protons) and a short, sharp shock that tends to alarm more skittery people. \n\n\nWe also had Breaking Bad good times with fulminate of mercury. Of course, that leads to excursions into fulminating silver, fulminating gold, fulminating platinum and fulminating rhodium. Fulminate means to ‚Äòcriticize angrily or to explode with noise and violence‚Äô; so, it was good that we had these compounds with which to play. \n\n\nThat left us to fiddle around with my ternary explosive candidate for ‚Äúmost likely to explode early and wipe out a significant percentage of the population‚Äù. \n\n\nPine cubes just wouldn‚Äôt work, for the reason that I needed to isolate the oxidizer (a cryogenic fluid), the initiator (Thermite) and the fuel (Composition-4). \n\n\nI sat in uffish thought in the base‚Äôs machine shop when I had an idea. An awful idea. I had a wonderful, awful idea.\n\n\nTernary explosive? Let‚Äôs exploit ternary *space*.\n\n\nLet‚Äôs build a sheet-metal pyramid with three enclosures, and the bonus, we‚Äôd have gravity on our side. \n\n\nEnvision a hollow, 4-sided pyramid. A simple sheet-metal floor would isolate the thermite at the top, plus give us a spot to set the fuse, whether electrical or mechanical. \n\n\nBelow that, another sheet-metal partition would allow for the storage of the Dewar which would contain the oxidizer. \n\n\nThen, the base would contain the fuel, in this case, a block or five of Composition-4. \n\n\nIt could easily be welded shut with all the main participants shielded from the heat. Then, it could also be scaled upwards or downwards, as we‚Äôre dealing with the economy of size (more bang per unit volume) so we could make it as large or small as we wanted. \n\n\nWe whipped up a few different versions of Thermite. Some the old-fashioned powdered aluminum and iron oxide, some with powdered lanthanum-tungsten oxide, and another with magnesium and boron trioxide.\n\n\nWe had a cryogenic liquid cylinder delivered with 365 liters of liquid oxygen. \n\n\nWe had access to as much C-4 as we could possibly want. \n\n\nIn the words of Beetle Juice: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs showtime.‚Äù\n\n*To be continued‚Ä¶*",

    "body": "Simply an update on how my chemical studies have gone. Not including any of the ingredients or processes on how to make them since that‚Äòs how my last post got deleted. Sorry to the mod that has to read through all of this\n\n(BEGIN OF NOTES)\nSafety tips and info:\n\nWhat to contain toxic chemicals in.\nTo contain toxic chemicals, prioritize using glass, stainless steel, or ceramic containers over plastic, especially when storing or heating food or beverages. Additionally, opt for natural and organic products, avoid fragrances, and consider making your own cleaning products using ingredients like vinegar and baking soda\nExtra info:\nhttps://ehs.wisc.edu/labs-research/chemical-safety/chemical-safety-guide/chemical-storage/\n\nExample:\nUse a glass jar with a tight lid to contain chemicals. Hydrofluoric acid can NOT be contained in a glass jar. To safely contain toxic chemicals, use tightly sealed, original containers with proper labels, and store them in a locked cabinet out of children's reach. Never use food containers or mix chemicals with other products. If a container is corroding, repackage it and label it clear\n\nWhat to contain toxic gasses in:\nTo contain toxic gases, several methods can be employed. Fume hoods and glove boxesare common lab safety equipment that use ventilation to contain and exhaust toxic gases. Additionally, gas cabinets and exhausted enclosures with negative pressure and ventilation are crucial for storing and handling compressed gas cylinders, especially for highly toxic gases. For specific applications, like welding, local exhaust ventilation systems can be used to capture and remove fumes.¬†\nExtra info:\nhttps://www.ehs.uci.edu/training/tango/_pdf/ToxicGasFactSheet.pdf\n\nWhat to wear while working with dangerous chemicals:\nGloves, boots, overalls or coat, respirator, and face shield. Either wear thick or rubber clothes.\n\nHow to remove chemical gasses\nTo remove chemical gases, focus on ventilation, air purification, and source control. Ventilate by opening windows, using exhaust fans, and ensuring cross-ventilation. Employ air purifiers with activated carbon filters to remove odors, VOCs, and gases. Identify and remove or mitigate sources of chemical emissions, such as using lower-emitting products or replacing outdated materials.¬†\n\nHow to make a gas mask: \n\nStep 1: Supplies\n\nFor this project you will need the following:\n- a 2 liter soda bottle\n- a n95 rated face mask that is good for particulates. Tear gas is a dust, not a gas so this will be perfect\n- Duct tape (i used gorilla tape\n- Stapler\nStep 2: Mark and Cut\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to mark your bottle and cut it. I used a sharpie to mark the bottom off and the dip the bottle takes to fit to your face. I then took a regular knife and cut the shape out.\nStep 3: Tape the Edge\n\nFor this to work, you have to create a seal on your face with the bottle. i created this seal with a bit of gorilla tape around the edges. Wrap the tape around the edges until you feel like you'll get a good seal. Check the seal by putting the mask on your face, plugging the spout and breathing in. If you have a seal, the bottle should concave a bit to your face.\nStep 4: Disassemble the Facemask and Put Into Bottle\n\n\n\nPull off both of the yellow straps from the facemask (SAVE THEM!) to have a strapless mask. From here you can just stuff it into the bottle.\nStep 5: Make a Hands-free Mask\n\nYou could stop here if you just wanted something you could hold to your face, but if you want hands-free operation, you can reuse the yellow straps and staple them to the mask.\nAnd Your Mask Is Done!\n\nNow you can run around in the tear gas a little easier, just slide the mask over your face, make sure the straps are tight and you're ready to go.\n\nIf you have improvements or your own builds, please post them in the comments below.

changes in perception, mood and cognitive processes.1\nPsychedelics affect all the senses, altering a person‚Äôs thinking, sense of time and emotions. They can also cause a person to hallucinate‚Äîseeing or hearing things that do not exist or are distorted.1\n\nWhat do psychedelics look like?\nThere are many different kinds of psychedelics. Some occur naturally, in trees, vines, seeds, fungi and leaves. Others are made in laboratories.2 They come in many forms including tablets, blotter paper, dried mushrooms, powders and crystalline powders.\n\nTypes of psychedelics\n* LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) is made from a substance found in ergot, which is a fungus that infects rye.3\n* Psilocybin is a naturally occurring substance found in mushrooms and is found in many parts of the world.4\n* Mescaline is derived from the Mexican peyote and San Pedro cactus and produces similar effects to LSD.5\n* DMT (Diemethyltryptamine) is structurally similar to psilocin, an alkaloid found in psilocybin mushrooms. It can be synthesised in the laboratory but is also a naturally occurring component of several plants.4\n* 2C-B (4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine) is a psychedelic drug first synthesised in 1974. 2C-B is considered both a psychedelic and a mild entactogenic. ‚ÄòEntactogen‚Äô means ‚Äòtouching within‚Äô and is a term used by psychiatrists to classify MDMA and related drugs.6\n* Peyote (Lophophora williamsii) is the most well-known and potent psychedelic cactus, although the smallest and slowest growing. Instead of growing upward to form a column, it grows as ‚Äòbuttons‚Äô low to the ground. It has been used by Native Americans for over 5000 years.5\n* 25[-x]-NBOMe (N-methoxybenzyl) is the name for a series of drugs that have psychedelics effects. Reports indicate that there are a number of different versions of NBOMe available ‚Äì all with differing effects.7\n\nHow are they used?\nPsychedelics have been used since ancient times by various cultures throughout the world for their mystical and spiritual associations. LSD, magic mushrooms, Mescaline and DMT are usually swallowed, smoked or inhaled. Mushrooms are usually eaten fresh, cooked or brewed into a ‚Äòtea‚Äô.\nOccasionally, they may be mixed with tobacco or cannabis and smoked. Mescaline is usually swallowed. Peyote buttons may be ground into a powder and smoked with cannabis or tobacco. The buttons can also be chewed or soaked in water to produce a liquid.\nMost forms of NBOMe are inactive if swallowed, and the most common methods of taking them are under the tongue, held in the cheek or snorted.\nGenerally, people who use psychedelics don‚Äôt take them on a regular basis, but on occasions that may be weeks or months apart.\n\nEffects of psychedelics\nUse of any drug can have risks. It‚Äôs important to be careful when taking any type of drug.\nPsychedelics affect everyone differently, based on:\n* size, weight and health\n* whether the person is used to taking it\n* whether other drugs are taken around the same time\n* the amount taken\n* the strength of the drug (varies from batch to batch)\n* environment (where the drug is taken).\nThe effects of psychedelics can last several hours and vary a lot, depending on the type of psychedelic used.\n* feelings of euphoria\n* sense of relaxation and wellbeing\n* seeing and hearing things that aren‚Äôt there\n* confusion and trouble concentrating\n* dizziness\n* blurred vision\n* clumsiness\n* fast or irregular heart beat\n* breathing quickly\n* vomiting\n* sweating and chills\n* numbness.6,7\n\nImpact of mood and environment\nDrugs that affect a person‚Äôs mental state (psychoactive drugs) can also have varied effects depending on a person‚Äôs mood (often called the ‚Äòset‚Äô) or the environment they are in (the ‚Äòsetting‚Äô).\nSet:‚ÄØa person‚Äôs state of mind, previous encounters with psychedelic drugs, and expectations of what‚Äôs going to happen. For example, feelings of stress or anxiety before using psychedelic drugs may result in an unpleasant experience (bad trip).9\nSetting:‚ÄØthe environment in which someone consumes psychedelic drugs ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs known and familiar, who they‚Äôre with, if they‚Äôre indoors or outdoors, the type of music and light. For example, using psychedelics in a calm, quiet and relaxed environment can lead to, or contribute to, a pleasant experience but being in a noisy, crowded place may result in a negative experience.9\nBeing in a good state of mind, with trusted friends and a safe environment before taking psychedelics reduces the risk of having a bad trip.\n\nBad trips\nSometimes you can experience a ‚Äòbad trip‚Äô, which is frightening and disturbing hallucinations. This can lead to panic and unpredictable behaviour, like running across a road or attempting suicide.\nIf you take a large amount or have a strong batch, you are likely to experience negative effects of psychedelics.3,9\n\nFlashbacks\nThe most common long-term effect of psychedelic use is the ‚Äòflashback‚Äô. Flashbacks are a re-experience of the drug and can occur days, weeks, months and even years later.\nFlashbacks can be triggered by the use of other drugs or by stress, fatigue or physical exercise. The flashback experience can range from being pleasant to causing severe feelings of anxiety. They are usually visual and last for a minute or two.3,9\n\nMixing psychedelics with other drugs\nThe effects of mixing psychedelics with other drugs, including alcohol, prescription medications and over-the-counter medicines, are often unpredictable.\nMixing psychedelics with stimulant drugs increases the stimulant effect and can further increase heart rate and place the body under extreme stress. Stimulants can also increase anxiety which can lead to a negative experience.10\nMixing psychedelics with benzodiazepines can increase anxiety, sadness and rapid heart rate.11\n\nReducing harm\nUse of any drug always carries some risk.¬†\nIf you do decide to use psychedelics, it‚Äôs important to consider:\n* it‚Äôs difficult to predict the strength and effects of psychedelics (even if they have been taken before), as the strength and potency can vary from batch to batch\n* people with mental health conditions or a family history of these conditions should avoid using psychedelics\n* taking psychedelics in a familiar environment in the company of people who are known and trusted may alleviate any unpleasant emotional effects. Anxiety can be counteracted by taking deep, regular breaths while sitting down.\nUsing psychedelics is likely to be more dangerous when:\n* taken in combination with alcohol or other drugs, particularly stimulants such as crystal methamphetamine (‚Äòice‚Äô) or ecstasy\n* driving or operating heavy machinery\n* judgment or motor coordination is required\n* alone (in case medical assistance is required)\n* the person has mental health issues.\n\nDependence and tolerance\nMost psychedelics produce tolerance quickly, meaning you need to take larger doses to get the same effect. Psychological dependence can happen for some people.\nIt‚Äôs not likely you can become physically dependent on psychedelics. There are no withdrawal symptoms even after using them for a long time.\n\nRemedies:\n\nCough medicine\nDrug type:\nantitussives and expectorants\nEffects:\nparanoia and confusion, excessive sweating, nausea and vomiting (large quantities of cough syrup almost always cause people to throw up). Belly pain, irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure, restlessness, dry, itchy skin and facial redness.\n\nNausea relief medicine\nDrug type:\nAntiemetic drug\nEffects: \ndrowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and dry mouth\n\nLaxatives\nDrug type:\ngastrointestinal agent\nEffects:\nbloating, gas, stomach cramps, and nausea\n\nRemedies extra facts:\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/home-remedies\n\nFor Coughs and Colds: \n* Honey:Honey can soothe a sore throat and suppress coughs, potentially even more effectively than some over-the-counter cough suppressants.¬†\n* Slippery Elm Tea:Slippery elm bark can be used to make a tea that soothes coughs and sore throats due to its high mucilage content.¬†\n* Warm Saltwater Gargle:Gargling with warm salt water can help reduce throat inflammation and clear mucus.¬†\n* Steam Inhalation:Breathing in steam from a hot pot of water can help loosen congestion and soothe sinuses.¬†\n* Ginger:Ginger can help ease nausea and vomiting, and some studies suggest it may also reduce pain from headaches and menstrual cramps.¬†\n* Chamomile Tea:Chamomile tea can help relax muscles and ease stomach cramps, making it a good option for upset stomachs.¬†\nFor Upset Stomach: \n* Peppermint Tea:Peppermint tea can relax the muscles of the digestive tract and reduce cramping and spasms.¬†\n* Apple Cider Vinegar:Apple cider vinegar can help neutralize an upset stomach and may aid in starch digestion.¬†\n* Ginger:Ginger is a well-known remedy for nausea and can be helpful for stomachaches.¬†\nOther Common Remedies: \n* Rest and Hydration:Getting enough rest and staying hydrated are crucial for recovering from illnesses like the flu.¬†\n* Warm Broth:Warm chicken or beef broth can help stay hydrated and soothe a sore throat.¬†\n* Essential Oils:Some essential oils, like eucalyptus or peppermint, may have antiviral or antibacterial properties and can be used in steam inhalation or for aromatherapy.¬†\n* Aloe Vera:Aloe vera gel can help soothe skin irritations and promote healing, according to Healthline.¬†\nImportant Considerations: \n* Consult with a Doctor:Always talk to a doctor before using home remedies, especially if you have a serious condition or are taking medication.¬†\n* Safety:Be aware that some home remedies may not be suitable for everyone, and some herbs can interact with medications.¬†\n* Effectiveness:Not all home remedies are proven to be effective, and some may only provide temporary relief.¬†\n\n\nStimulants and depressants facts:\n\nNeurotransmitter Interactions: \nIncreased dopamine release from caffeine enhances mood, while alcohol initially boosts but ultimately depresses dopamine levels. Alcohol enhances GABA (inhibitory) and inhibits glutamate (excitatory), while caffeine blocks adenosine receptors to promote alertness.\n\nCardiovascular Changes: \nCaffeine increases heart rate and blood pressure; alcohol can decrease heart rate, leading to cardiovascular stress and irregularities.\n\nMetabolism and Absorption: \nAlcohol metabolism occurs primarily in the liver; caffeine may alter the metabolism of alcohol, potentially speeding up its absorption into the bloodstream.\n\nImpact on the Central Nervous System (CNS): \nCaffeine‚Äôs stimulation can mask alcohol's depressant effects, impairing judgment and coordination.\n\nTolerance and Sensitization: \nRegular use may create tolerance, requiring higher amounts for effects, increasing addiction risks. Some individuals may have increased sensitivity to the depressant effects of alcohol when combined¬†\n\nCognitive and Behavioral Changes: \nCombined use can significantly impair cognitive processing; alcohol impairs judgment, while caffeine may create a false sense of clarity. Increases impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors, leading to potentially dangerous decisions.\n\nInfluence on Mood and Emotional Regulation: \nCauses unpredictable mood swings, with caffeine temporarily elevating mood and alcohol potentially leading to depression or anxiety afterward. Withdrawal from either substance can exacerbate symptoms of the other, introducing cycles of dependence.\n\nExtras\n\n1. H2o + Cobalt Chloride + sodium hydroxide = bioluminescence inside if the H2o\n2. Ethanol is the main element used in most alcohols\n3. Sodium + water = explosion\n4. Chemicals that numb pain. \t\n* Benzocaine.\n* Dibucaine.\n* Lidocaine.\n* Phenol.\n* Pramoxine.\n* Prilocaine.\n5. fertilizer, gunpowder, and hydrogen peroxide, can be used as explosive materials in IEDs (see table ). Explosives must contain a fuel and an oxidizer, which provides the oxygen needed to sustain the reaction.\n\n\n(END OF NOTES)\n\nI have videos as well for relative things but am not sure if I can share any of them.

    "body": "Drivers on Interstate 787 staring down another work week were treated again to the relentless, nauseating smell of human waste as they motored through Albany and neighboring communities. \n\nA new clue about the origin of the offending smell has emerged, but more on that outsider in a moment.\n\nThe stink has persisted for months and officials on the west side of the river have not sniffed out the cause.\n\nAngelo Gaudio, the Albany County Water Purification District's executive director, has been smelling it too. He says he is well aware of the consternation it has raised.\n\n\"We have seen it,\" he said. \"We have seen it coming off exits on I-787 and down in Menands on certain days.\" Gaudio said that they are compiling complaints and that the state Department of Environmental Conservation has been in touch as part of its investigation into the smell. \n\nHe noted that the plant has been in its current location since the 1970s and that procedures have largely remained the same for decades though they have made one recent change. They have switched odor control chemicals from Endimal, a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium chlorite, to hydrogen peroxide. Both substances are commonly used to minimize odors in wastewater treatment.\n\nThe noxious odors commonly associated with sewage treatment plants are caused by hydrogen sulfide and, in the inherently smelly sewage treatment business, Gaudio said that they \"do their best to mitigate\" unpleasant emissions from the plant. \n\nAlison McLean Lane, who represents Menands in the Albany County Legislature, has also been trying to track down the source while fielding complaints from constituents and trying to keep at bay the rumors on community Facebook pages. \n\n\"No municipal government wants to be a source of what is a nuisance to the community,\" Lane said. \"Everyone should be able to enjoy their homes in peace.\"\n\nShe has met with village mayor Brian Marsh and has had ongoing conversations with Gaudio. On a recent visit to the Albany County plant she said she did not smell anything except when she was in an area where wastewater was actively being treated. \n\nGaudio could not say definitively that the Albany plant never smells but suggested there might be \"other sources of odor.\"\n\nBut where?\n\nA possible culprit could be a mile away across the Hudson River at the Rensselaer County Sewer District plant. Plant Operations and Management Director Jason Keeler did not respond to repeated requests for comment this story. Rensselaer County spokesperson Rich Crist also did not respond to specific questions about operations at the plant. \n\nThe DEC did not provide an answer to questions about possible issues at the plant, referring back to an earlier statement about about the department's ongoing investigation into the smell. \n\nOn a visit to the Water Street plant Wednesday afternoon a Times Union reporter encountered an overpowering, eye-watering odor in public parts of the facility including near administrative offices where one person could be seen working. The smell bore a striking olfactory resemblance to Monday morning's stench and the ongoing smell that many in the area have noticed over the last eight month.\n\nIn the ongoing saga of \"the smell,\" it cannot be ruled out that though Albany has smelt it, Rensselaer County may have dealt it.

Since then, the container of lye water has been sitting in a box in a corner. I'm wondering if I could re-use the water to make another set of century eggs?

To your other point about potency, the strong bases are indeed consumed in the reaction to make the eggs, so the lye water will be less potent each time it is used. That doesn't mean that it won't work more than once, but it won't be quite as fast and effective, and eventually it will stop working with reuse.\n\nThe best way to find out how much potency it lost is to give it a try and report back with the results. Is the change in potency noticeable, in which case you won't be able to reuse the water many times (probably possible to refresh it with a partial batch rather than starting from scratch), or is it negligible, in which case one batch will last longer?",
