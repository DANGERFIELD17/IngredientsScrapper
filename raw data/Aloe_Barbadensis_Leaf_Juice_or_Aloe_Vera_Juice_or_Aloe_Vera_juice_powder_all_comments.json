Put 6 cups of water in pan, medium low heat\n2. Put grated soap in pan, stir occasionally until dissolved\n3. Open all bottles/containers, set aside lids\n4. Add borax and washing soda, stir until all dissolved\n(Now you need to work somewhat quickly as this mixture will set into a gel as it cools)\n5. Turn off heat\n6. Fill each bottle/container 1/4 full of the mixture (no more than that or you'll have trouble using the soap later)\n7. After you put all of the mixture in the bottles, top of bottles with water until they are almost (but not totally) full. \n8. Put on lids, SHAKE. \n\nHow to use:\n1. Shake bottle\n2. Pour about 1/2 to 2/3 cup into a full load of washing \n\nTips/tricks:\n-To reduce gelling, add a teaspoon or two of conventional laundy detergent\n-Avoid using a wood spoon when making this as it can soak into the spoon, making it unusable for food. If you use metal/plastic it should be totally fine for cooking after a thorough washing.\n\nSorry, that took me a little while to type up...",

I use Aloe Vera juice to spray my locs throughout my retwist and I retwist using oil. for two strands I retwist clockwise and two strand twist counterclockwise. for the bob I do the steps I just mentioned and then I bend the locs to the length I want (I prefer my locs to hit right before they touch my shoulders.) once I choose my length I wrap the remaining length of my locs around itself and tie it off with some bands. I feel like this sounds confusing so on my next retwist I will do a small tutorial for my visual learners! Ill do the tutorial either on myself or my boyfriend since I also maintain his locs.",

Well I always thought the reason people take pills with water was just because it goes down easier.\n\nI spent a year and months mostly if not always dry swallowing pills because it was easy to do and while not the most comfortable thing to do, not painful. (I drink plenty of water, just take my medicine in the morning rush while in the car).\n\nWell boy was I wrong, I Google searched after an hour of extreme pain and uncomfortable cramps and burping that they are to avoid chemical burns. \n\nI considered the emergency room but as a male in the US I decided it was best to suffer through the night and learn my lesson. I also Google searched how to fix the pain and drank liquids but it was midnight and too late to eat or go buy aloe Vera juice and other recommended remedies. \n\nSo I suffered on for hours feeling painful burps and like there was a hole in my stomach. The next day eating and drinking was very uncomfortable, but was forgotten after an additional day or two. \n\nTL;DR: Dry swallowing pills for months and finally got a nasty chemical burn and hours of pain to the point where I couldn't sleep and even felt the consequences days after. \n\nDrink plenty of water with pills!",

I just wanted to do this for myself to save some money.\n\nBuying each of these ingredients together on Etsy totals approx. $80, and even though that's less than the price of one teensy bottle of the oil cleanser that they are marketing, it's still a little pricy. I'm wondering if I can cut out more ingredients than I already am while still getting the same effects\n\n\\--\n\nProposed ingredients of my DIY dupe:\n\nAloe juice, watermelon seed oil, grapeseed oil, walnut oil, camellia oil, black seed (cumin) oil, coco betaine, preservative consisting of phenyoxyethanol, sorbic acid, caprylyl glycol.\n\n\\--\n\n Ingredients of original product ( [https://www.oumere.com/products/oil-dissolution-theory](https://www.oumere.com/products/oil-dissolution-theory) ):\n\nAloe barbadensis leaf juice, water, watermelon seed oil, grapeseed oil, castor oil, calendula oil, walnut oil, Camellia Japonica oil, coco betaine, cocaminodopropylamine oxide, phenyoxyethanol, sorbic acid\\*, caprylyl glycol\n\n\\--\n\nHere are my main questions:\n\n1. I know that I ommitted a few ingredients in my Etsy cart, are any of them mistakes to not add?\n2. Are there any ingredients on my purchase list that will not have any significant benefit and I don't have to buy?\n3. What approximate proportions would you recommend per ingredient/type of ingredient?\n4. Are there any trick to making this or can I literally just measure them out and then mix them together in a little glass/plastic jar?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a materials science & engineering student w/ lab experience but this DIY beauty stuff is completely new to me! Any recommendations would be super helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you, everyone!",

You are buying in the wrong place. There are proper ingredients suppliers.\n\nIs it a bi-phase oil cleanser?? If so, marketing is everything.

        "body": "I have not made a rinse off bi-phase cleanser but I made several of those you apply with cotton disks. 50% is your oil phase, 50% is water phase. Now the challenge: if you want them to separate the polarities must be as different as possible. That’s why isododecane and cyclopentasiloxane are used in the leave on versions (also because they are volatile which isn’t relevant for rinse off). You also want to add some salt to your water phase (improves separation). 1-1.5%. You need surfactants (coco betaine in this case) but if you use too much it will turn into a cloudy emulsion and you won’t get two defined layers. Start experimenting with as little as possible (say 2% ASM) and see whether it rinses off well. Re oils, I would lose all those weird veg oils and go for the mineral oil (unless you want to splurge on squalane which should also work in theory because it’s a hydrocarbon). Another reason not to use veg oils is stability. They are prone to oxidation (except for those full of saturated fats but these are usually solid). So, 50% mineral oil (mystic moments sold on amazon), 1.5% of NaCL or Mg sulfite, 2% of coco betaine (ASM not as supplied), water and preservative. It’s up to you if you want to add aloe and conditioning agents.",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin.

        "body": "So... brace yourself this post may be long. \n\nI want to be really careful with the idea of purging. I think there’s a lot of ideas that skin is holding onto toxins or bad stuff that needs to be purged out. To me, that is what the term “purging” implies. \n\nWhile it is true that actives can cause initial breakouts, calling all breakouts purging can be dangerous IMO because some people are just flat-out irritating their skin. The initial breakouts from actives are acne spots that were already there coming to a head and resolving, such as closed comedones. However, many times (IME), people who are asking for advice are told to simply power through the “purging” phase that may take months to end. IME, this is largely due to irritation and less due to lingering acne. \n\nTopical retinoids and AHAs CAN be used without causing much skin upset, but they have to be introduced very slowly to build tolerance. Retinoids especially can be super duper irritating, hence the skin peeling and sensitivities. \n\nI feel like “purging” is it’s own discussion, and will have several different opinions presented depending who you ask. I’ve been on MakeupAlley and SCA for over ten years and seen a variation of ideas. \n\nPersonally, I dislike that it is a blanket statement applied to almost all actives (and sometimes non-actives) when in lots of cases I’ve seen, it is simply irritation that eventually resolves (or for some, never does) when their skin finally adjusts. \n\nAgain though, that’s my personal opinion and wasn’t an idea I intended to get too deep into here.",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

At first I didn't realize how much it was hurting me. I was confused when the following morning my skin was flaking like crazy. I thought at first  it was because I had recently started using some other Ordinary products \\(the niacinamide and hyaluronic acid serums\\), it didn't occur to me it was the retinol since I had used retinol for many years. I tried using the retinol again the following night, AND HOLY COW THE PAIN AND REGRET.

Sometimes, I’ll sleep with it on. I just make sure to tie my silk scarf over my bonnet and conditioner cap to prevent any leaking. I follow up with a leave in conditioner and some scented shea butter. I only blowout my hair every other wash with a lot of heat protectant.

This should be pinned so people visiting the subreddit for the first time would know where to start with all their questions. \n\nI would add some form of probiotics on the list. Most people with GERD have a damaged stomach lining and the PPI’s could mess with your digestive system so the probiotics just help your body out a little more. It’s been helping me at least. \n\nChew your food thoroughly and take your time eating, it will help your body digests food better and can help prevent heartburn. \n\nEating bananas before breakfast or any meal helps “lubricate” the throat and esophagus and it’s alkaline aka one of the few fruits that aren’t acidic. \n\nFiber supplements or just eating more healthy greens in general. Since i was diagnosed with GERD and taking PPI’s I’ve been constipated and the extra fiber really helps. \n\nA lot of people tend to agree with trying to avoid drinking liquids during a meal, if possible try waiting 10 minutes after you’ve finished a meal to drink liquids in large gulps.",

I started having bad constipation and found blood in my poop ( twice) \n\nNot the best thing for someone with health anxiety. My mom told me it was due to hemmoriids and not to worry. I was super anxious the entire month.\n\n- My stomach was gassy and painful and my dad spoke to a GI specialist who prescribed medicine at the same time.\n\n- I started having neck pain which was growing very slowly over the past year. A lot of my work is on the phone so my posture isn't the best and I was anyway going through so much stress.\n\n- My sinus infection was really bad in January and I had antibiotics.\n\n- By first week February I was having severe light headidness which hasn't gone till day.\n\n- I produce a lot of white thick phlegm. It's also foul smelling and all day in my throat.\n\n- my stomach still feels gassy\n\n- I have some rectom burning at times\n\n- my neck and shoulders are very stiff \n\nThe worst part is the constant light headidness and fatigue. It's like an imbalance which is always there.\n\n-I've had blood work and it's all clear. My internist thinks it's neck tension related has reffered me to a chiropractor. I've been going to the chriopractor and he said my muscles are very tense and it will take time to heal.\n\n- MY ent says I also have a problem with my eustachian tubes which causes constant pressure in my ears.\n\n- My stomach still feels weird but I haven't gone to a GI specialist due to Covid.\n\n- I've been to a neoruologist who says I'm fine and just anxious and very stressed. He's given me anti anxiety medicine which I haven't taken.\n\nIm only 26, this constant fear of feeling that o have some serious illness is scary. \nCan GERD cause all of the above?",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Slowish one today, very slice of life. I think I know what the next couple chapters are going to look like, at least. Next chapter is probably going to be Pizza and naming the voices, then the Baseball Game, then Rosi's introduction.\n\nNew Years of Conquest, aka the Sifal Spinoff, has been steaming ahead at a steady clip. I got a piece of [fanart ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1frfj5p/the_worst_internship_ever_new_years_of_conquest/)for it the other day, too, which is always a treat. It's a little funny how that's sort of evolving into a dark office comedy featuring Arxur and Nevoks trying to live together.\n\nAnyway, mom said it was Chiri's turn to be dead this week.\n\n[\\[First\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/12yfq9g/new_york_carnival_01_wherein_an_arxur_first/) - [\\[Prev\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1fi4dxn/new_york_carnival_44_breakfast_of_champions/) - [\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1g8s1lc/new_york_carnival_46_a_wizard_knows_the_name_of/)\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Memory Transcription Subject: Chiri, Gojid Refugee**\n\n*Date \\[standardized human time\\]: November 2, 2136*\n\nHeading downstairs to the restaurant wasn’t nearly as bad as the subtly implied threat that, some hours distantly into the future, I’d have to climb back up again. But I followed David down nevertheless, and so did Toki. That was the way of humans, it seemed. Even pre-contact, they were very used to having furred and besnouted creatures following them around. Humanity probably would've fit into the Federation beautifully, were it not for the (evidently baseless) concerns that they were going to start tearing people apart with their teeth.\n\nWell, I got to taste all the wonderful Earthling foods, and the Federation at large didn't. Their loss.\n\n*Are we still in the Federation, or does going native on Earth qualify as a defection?* asked the odd voice.\n\nGood question. Are the Venlil still in the Federation?\n\n*That's another good question,* said the critical voice.\n\nI spared a glance for the bar I'd be working and learning at today, but, at least initially, I followed David into his kitchen. I could see him pretty well from the restaurant tables, but I wanted to watch him up close as he got started.\n\n“First let's get the dough rising,” he said, pouring flour into a bowl with water and some kind of fragrant vegetable oil. “Gonna go pizza dough style. Nice and chewy. Very New York.”\n\n“Point of order: what's pizza?” I asked.\n\nDavid perked up. “Well, probably dinner tonight,” he said excitedly. “Practically the official dish of New York. Chewy flatbread, topped with tomato sauce, topped with fresh mozzarella cheese, topped with whatever you like. Maybe we'll do some vegan sausage and mushrooms. Then you bake the whole thing until it's toasty and melty. It's delicious.”\n\nI chuckled to myself like I was part of some nefarious scheme. “Nyeheheh. Yet another delicious Earthling delicacy falls into my devious alien grasp.”\n\nDavid grinned back. He held a hand hovering by a shelf, then grabbed a box on a whim. “I’ll stick with instant yeast for the first batch, but I might want to consider other types for flavor. There used to be an old bakery in Manhattan that would use wild yeast or even yeast from wine.”\n\nYeast translated smoothly, thankfully. You don't inherit a generational winery like Garnet Orchards without knowing what turns your fruit juice into an interplanetarily popular brand of social intoxicant. Yeast was just *this* biosphere’s magic microorganism. We had a different one back on the Cradle, but if it turned sugars into alcohol, it was all the same. “I'm mostly curious why you're adding yeast to *bread*,” I said aloud.\n\n“The air bubbles are where the fluffiness comes from,” David said, looking at me curiously. “Why, what do you guys use?”\n\nI shrugged. “Baking powder, I think? I'm not a baking expert, but wouldn't the bubbles just escape?”\n\nDavid shook his head. “Wheat is a high-protein grain. It gets tacky and holds together once you've agitated it enough.”\n\nI nodded. “Makes sense. Human protein requirements are probably pretty high.”\n\nDavid raised an eyebrow. “What, because we're predators? I mean, yeah, but so are you, kinda. I wonder if you've been getting enough protein in the Federation.”\n\n*Oh my gods, we might be malnourished,* said the odd voice with an unexpected tone of rising excitement. *What if Gojids are meant to be stronger? We could be the first of our kind to reach our full potential! We should eat more protein right now.*\n\nI was still full from breakfast, but now I was curious. “Maybe! What are good protein sources on Earth?”\n\nDavid chuckled. “I mean, meat and eggs are the obvious ones, but no dice there. Dairy is going to take you a long way, though. Seriously, bodybuilders are *all in* on things like whey protein supplements. Beyond that, beans and certain grains are going to be high in protein. There's a reason why most human peasant dishes--foods eaten by people who couldn't reliably afford meat, historically--tend to boil down to ‘local bean with local grain’.” David worked the dough forcefully with his powerful hands as he spoke, slowly turning it into a sticky putty. “Before the bioreactors started up, half the world was still eating beans and rice. Pintos and short grain in the Americas, lentils and basmati in India… China used a lot of tofu, from soybeans, and even the middle east was pretty big on chickpeas and pita bread.” Satisfied, David covered the bowl of dough with plastic wrap and set it aside.\n\n“So what goes on *this* bread?” I asked.\n\n“That's the question,” said David. He tapped his foot in thought. “Again, it's just me in here. I need something I can pre-prep in the morning, then just spoon out to serve during lunch.” He opened one of his giant fridges and stared into it. I peeked around him, and a room-sized bounty of fresh produce stared back. “You said sweet flavors were popular in the Federation?”\n\nI nodded. “Absolutely. Sugar, fruit, even lightly sweet starchy things like squash and tubers. They’re all big movers.” I paused for a long moment. “Do you guys not do desserts? Sweetest thing I've had on Earth was a shot of Baileys.”\n\nDavid nodded over to a corner of the fridge. “We do dessert, I'm just not a specialized baker. There's some vegan blueberry turnovers from the store if you need a sweet snack.” He kept tapping his foot in thought like a Nevok as he looked in the fridge for inspiration. “Let's go tropical first, see where we're at. Maybe a Thai curry with fruit in it.”\n\nHe started fetching ingredients to put into a stew, and my mind wandered. “What's in the other fridges?” I asked.\n\nDavid paused, arms full of cans and… more bananas, if I wasn't mistaken? “Left to right, it's produce fridge, produce freezer, meat fridge, meat freezer.”\n\nMy eyes widened. It was a new day, and the morning’s new anxieties notwithstanding, I was actually pretty mentally refreshed. “Can I see the meat fridge?” I asked.\n\nDavid nodded towards it. “Knock yourself out. My hands are full, but the door's unlocked.”\n\n*Don't do it!* said the critical voice. *It's not for us. It will kill you.* \n\nI wasn't going to eat any!\n\n*What happened to endorsing forbidden knowledge?* asked the odd voice.\n\n*Good point,* said the critical voice. *Open the door, but try to get traumatized by the experience so you'll stop thinking about meat all the time.*\n\nI hesitantly reached out a paw towards the handle and tried not to tremble as I slowly pulled it open. \n\nIt was… mostly empty. A couple glass jars with tan paste or something, some wrinkly tubes in red and dark gray. There were three biggish chunks of meat hanging from the ceiling--a quadruped leg, an unidentifiable two inch thick sheet, and a dark red chunky thing with rib bones sticking out of it--but given the size of the fridge, I'd expected more.\n\n“There's not much in here,” I remarked.\n\n“We're not open,” David replied. “Meat doesn't last very long unfrozen. That's mostly smoked or cured things left in there. Duck confit, sausages, bacon… do I still have that ham and the steaks?”\n\nThose didn't translate for reasons that should probably be obvious at this point. “If you mean the leg thing and the rib thing, then yes?” I called back.\n\n“Awesome,” said David. “Yeah, if you ever want to roll the dice on trying meat, I’ll slice you off one of those nice dry-aged ribeye steaks.” He came up behind me, carefully, like he was still worried about the quills. “Probably wouldn’t chance it until the roads are cleared, though. No ambulances available if things go really wrong.” He rubbed my shoulder affectionately. “I like you a lot. I’d be really put out if you died.”\n\n*Aww, it’s like your neuroses are made for each other,* the odd voice said.\n\nI nuzzled his hand back, but otherwise let him get started cooking. Toasting his own spices from scratch was kinda neat to watch, but the actual process of putting a stew together didn’t keep my interest long. I wandered over to the bar and started… well, basically trying to taste every bottle on the shelf without getting plastered before lunchtime. Tiny sips. Just touching it to my tongue, in some cases. There was even an old distiller’s trick I knew for testing the scent. I rubbed a little of a brown spirit on the fur by my snout, aerating it, letting me collect the aroma. The major categories all tasted different, but it was interesting how even different whiskeys has subtly different aromas. This one sharper, this one smoother, this one with a touch of fruity sweetness to it. One even smelled loud and smokey. It was fascinating how much variety humans put into a single beverage, and it was just… distilled grain alcohol that had sat for a while in a wooden barrel.\n\nStill, I was getting warm despite my best efforts. “Hey, David?” I called out. “I was thinking about the *texture* of drinks over my cereal this morning. Is there anything to that, or…?”\n\nDavid stopped dead in his tracks and grinned. “See, this is what I’m talking about. Your head’s in the perfect place for this line of work. Yes, absolutely. I mean, we’re staying simple for our lunch service, but once we’re back to full power? Playing with texture is a key component of the Cropsey Carnival’s culinary style. I’ll show you a few examples when I can, but let me get you one now.” He pulled a plastic bottle out of the produce fridge, and wound up to throw it. “Here, catch.”\n\n“What? No!” I protested. “My depth perception is shit, let me just grab it from you.” I scurried over and snatched the greenish bottle out of his hand before he could toss it with enough force to shatter and splatter on the ground after I inevitably whiffed the catch. “What is it?”\n\n“It’s an aloe vera drink,” said David. “Sweetened cactus juice, basically. Non-alcoholic.”\n\nTaste-testing the entire back wall of a bar was pretty dehydrating. I cracked the juice open and took a long swing. The texture was bizarre! It was chunkier and pulpier than the orange juice was, and it was… slimy! It was still refreshing and good, but it was such an unexpected mouthfeel. Vegetal and bouncy. “Rum or tequila, maybe?” I said aloud.\n\n“Yup. Good choices,” said David. He pulled a ladleful of his inexplicably white stew off the stove and tasted it. “Oh, while you’re here, can you try this?” He held the ladle out for me to drink from.\n\nIt looked not entirely unlike the cereal I’d eaten this morning. “You sure milk and bananas are a good choice for Yotuls?” The milk was turning yellow and red with specks of spices, and I didn’t recognize the other chunks in it.\n\n“It’s coconut milk and plantains,” said David. “I’m staying vegan with this. It’ll probably be a while before anyone else is open-minded enough to try dairy. The tricky part was making a Thai curry without fermented fish sauce, but I worked around it. Try it.”\n\nIt certainly smelled amazing. Fragrant spices and herbs wafted off of the ladle. I took a sip of the broth. It was warm and tangy and savory, lightly sweet. Creamy, too, despite the lack of… well, cream. And the spices were incredible! Those were rare imports on my homeworld, and most Gojids tended to have more conservative palates. I dug in for a full bite, chunks and all. The plantains were clearly similar to bananas, but starchier. The texture was different, slightly mealier and less sweet, but more filling. But then the stew had chunks of bright and tangy-sweet fruit in it as well. Another citrus fruit, maybe? “What’s the yellowish bits?”\n\n“Pineapple,” said David. “What do you think?”\n\n“I think you’ve got a hit,” I said, savoring the taste. It was every flavor except bitter. My face felt warm. Almost irritated. I coughed. “Is that, um.” I coughed again, sniffling. “You’re sure there’s no meat in that, right?” My mouth was burning. It was suddenly getting weirdly difficult to breathe with how snotty I was. I was tearing up slightly, so I rubbed my eyes, and my eyes started burning as well. “I don’t… I don’t feel good.”\n\nI plunked down on the ground, and David practically bolted behind the bar for the first aid kit faster than I could see through watery irritated eyes. He had the emergency syringe out at the ready, but held off on using it. “Open your mouth?” he asked, and I obliged. “Deep breath.” I breathed. It burned, but I could mostly breath through my mouth alright. David stared, baffled. “I’m… I’m trying to look for reddish swelling, but your throat is *blue*. Are you okay? Can you breathe?”\n\n“Hard, but… yeah, so far,” I coughed. My nose was all runny. “Why is it burning? Am I gonna die?”\n\nDavid shook his head in disbelief. “There couldn’t be… I was so careful. It’s just plants. It *has* to just be plants! Maybe one of the spices? Does the word ‘capsaicin’ translate?”\n\nI fell over, delirious and choking…\n\n…on my own laughter. “You put fucking *firefruit* in that stew?” I said, coughing and giggling. “No fuckin’ wonder!” I sniffled and coughed again. “I’m not… the Cradle doesn’t *do* spicy food.” I took a deep breath and exhaled. “Whew! Okay, that’s a bit of a kick, yeah.” I put the bottle of aloe vera juice up to my lips and drank deeply, which helped a bit. “Fuckin’... human bounty, man. You got too many damn vegetables for a predator species, you know?”\n\nDavid hugged me with a sigh of relief. “Jesus. Don’t scare me like that. I thought you were dying.”\n\n“Nah, juss… warm and tipsy and my face hurts,” I said, coughing and hugging him back. “Whass next?”",

I've seen all sorts of different things; from mushroom sauce, vegan \"fishsauce\", soy sauce and vinegar, and more.  Personally, you can use a little bit of extra of light soy sauce and mix in some \"Golden Mountain\" sauce for a workable piece.\n\nAlso, unless David was making the curry \"Thai Hot\", which I am not sure that he would, Chiri has a long way to go on her spice journey.  This just goes to show how different the fed enforced conformity has affected their palates.  With the sheer number of peppers available, it's just another thing for her to be impressed with.  \n\n(Edit: These curries would probably go over really well with the avians like the Krakotl or Duerten.

It’s really unfortunate and I wish it was regarded the same as Fragrance, which has a rating of 8. I would say that essential oils are more problematic than artificial fragrance because there are a LOT of chemicals in there that we can’t control. \n\nArtificial fragrance is basically essential oils with some chemicals taken out or mix & matched. ( EWG is very biased/people do not understand the “risks” presented in studies (like mice taking something internally at massive doses vs humans putting very low dosage on skin). It really contributes to the fear-mongering & boost marketing value to “natural” and “organic” products. \n\nAs with everything, the dose makes the medicine/poison. \n\nI really hope that this essential oil fad dies down in the future. They can be very problematic for sensitive skinned folks. \n\nWe should all be focusing on ingredients that are safe & effective & environment-friendly regardless of origin. \n\nLab made chemicals can be so much better for the environment bc it’s gonna take massive cutting down of natural environments to plant these ~all natural and organic~ ingredients & cutting them all down again to go into our skincare products. Like, how many of these trees are we going to cut down to get the essential oils? How much beeswax can we take VS making something chemically identical to it in the lab?\n\nSame thing with “natural” things that are very popular,, like the looooads of people who wanna natural DIY and order cocoa butter and exotic oils from other countries, polluting the environment with all those air and ship shipments, etc. Things are a lot more complex than people make them out to be.",

    "body": "Hi everyone, I thought I would post a positive story to encourage everyone that healing is possible. I am a 25 year old female and I am a pharmacist. For anyone interested. I was diagnosed with Mild Chronic gastritis and esophagitis as well as pots in June this year via a NASA test and endoscopy. I took a month off work and read many posts on here about how to cure gastritis. I was extremely sick, going from 63kg to 48.5kg in a matter of weeks. I was prescribed pantoprazole 40mg for 3 months. Despite being a pharmacist I am not a advocate for medication, I am a advocate for lifestyle modifications and less medication is better. I took it for a week and decided it wasn’t for me. Instead I went cold turkey on the PPI and stuck to a strict bland diet, including no caffeine ( no chocolate)- which was extremely hard as I am a sweet tooth, no alcohol, no gluten, no dairy and no red meat. I brought organic groceries as much as I could including a tone of bone and chicken broth. I took digestive enzymes, artichoke capsules, magnesium supplements and also drank cabbage juice. Yesterday I had another endoscopy and my results confirmed that my “chronic” gastritis and esophagitis was completely gone within two months.  I am still trying to put on weight but I am able to finally eat what I like somewhat as I still have pots so I have to be careful. If anyone is interested in any more details or brands of what I ate/drank/supplements please feel free to message me. I know what it’s like to suffer from this thinking am I going to have this for life, it made me extremely sick, miserable but there is always a cure for gastritis. You do not have to live with this. Thanks for taking the time to read 😊 \n\nEdit: \nSupplements: \n\nI kept my supplements very simple. I took Mag-Sup ( 500mg magnesium aspartate) 2-4 tablets daily, Herbsofgold Digest-Zymes 1 capsule before every main meal ( three times a day), Natures Sunshine Globe Artichoke 6000mg ( 1 twice a day), Ostelin Vitamin D3 1000IU 1 capsule daily and Nutra Organics bone and chicken broth. Aloe Vera of Australia natural juice, 50ml twice a day. Life Cykle Lions Mane 2mls daily added to chamomile tea. \n\nFood: \n\nProtein- plain chicken, turkey mince, salmon, barramundi, prawns. \nVegetables ( never consumed any raw vegetables as they are hard to digest)- cooked/blended up sweet potato, pumpkin, asparagus, brussel sprouts, carrot, celery, asparagus, zucchini, cabbage, ginger\nFruit: blueberries, strawberries, kiwi fruit, watermelon.\nCarbs: white rice, gluten-free oats \nSeasonings: salt, oregano, Manuka honey, nutritional yeast ( added on most meals) \nDrinks: cabbage juice ( made my own juice in the mornings with green cabbage), aloe Vera juice, chamomile tea, ginger tea.\nAVOID: gluten, dairy, red meat, caffeine, chocolate, spicy food, raw veggies, alcohol.\n\nStress: \n\nTook a month off work, had a hot bath everyday. Stress can push your body into ‘fight or flight’ mode however in order to heal you need to move your body into ‘rest and digest’\n\nMy symptoms: \n\nI had chest pain, severe acid reflux, regurgitation of food, significant weight loss, stomach pain, gnawing pain, back pain, facial flushing, headaches, anxiety, heart palpitations, trapped gas.\n\nEdit: 29/08/23 \n\nI have eaten ice cream, chocolate, red meats, wine, coffee, spice with no symptoms at all 😊\n\nEdit: 10/02/24 \n\nHave had no issues whatsoever. Still completely healed. Can eat and drink anything. \n\nEdit: 18/05/24 \n\nStill completely healed. Have been eating and drinking anything with no symptoms at all \n\nEdit: 01/01/25\n\nStill healed ☺️",

I would know as I went though a very depressed time after being diagnosed. I just wanted to share my honest experience and I hope that it helps you. Anyone can cure gastritis with the right mindset and strict diet which will pay off. One thing I have learnt is when you are stressed/upset your body shuts down and goes into fight or flight mode which causes digestion to be suppressed so the body can reroute its resources to fight the so called “attacker”. Therefore it’s extremely important to reduce all stress to push your body back into rest and digest prioritising digestion which can help give your body the tools to heal gastritis. The body is designed to heal. You’ve got this 💪",

    "body": "Anyone on any form of social media knows about Lume Deodorant; their advertising is on point! I loved the catchy commercials, positive reviews, and had been using natural deodorants for years so I thought why the heck not?!? I've been using for 2+ months and felt it was time to write about my experience. I'm a big believer in honesty and transparency and my biggest criticism of this product/company is the inability to leave an unbiased review, even/especially if it's negative; the company never posted my less than stellar review on their website so I'm taking it to this forum. Underarms are skin too!\n\nI purchased the 3oz Lume Unscented Deodorant in the tube for $19USD. I've used it approximately 60x, pea sized amount per pit and I still have some left. It's vegan, cruelty-free, aluminum-free, and baking-soda fee. It's a mandelic acid based product. In the past I've used Schmidt's Original and Sensitive, Native, and an independent Etsy brand. All but Native worked well for odor but eventually they all irritated my pits to different degrees\n\n**PRO** \n\n* The first positive I will say is that it never irritated my pits, even directly after shaving. It's safe to use anywhere the gets stinky but I only have used on my underarms.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* DISHONEST PRACTICES As I mentioned before, I think the company promotes skewed product reviews by omitting critical reviews. This is not cool by me.\n* INEFFECTIVE- Guys, nobody wanted this product to work more than me. I don't have a strong body odor but my underarms will get stinky if I don't use anything. I don't care about getting sweaty (this is not an antiperspirant) but this really didn't work well to control odor. The company is very upfront that to use the product effectively, your clothes need to be treated first to wash off residual bacteria and residue from former products. I bought their recommended detergent and treated all my clothing as directed; nope, still stinky. I repeated the clothing treatments multiples times without results hoping it would work. At that point, I was past the 30 day return window. I bought a few new (washed) shirts and still experienced odor so I think the washing is kind of BS. Some days it would work better than others but it def didn't live up to the 72 hour odor control the company claims. It'll work well for a few hours but after that...phew. My body actually has a different, worse scent when I use this product. \n* \"UNSCENTED\"  is more like...old bananas. It mostly fades but kind of off-putting.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nWater, Mandelic Acid, Arrowroot Powder, Tapioca Starch, Isoamyl Laurate, Sodium Acrylate/ Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer, Caffeine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Theobroama Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Isohexadecane, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Sodium Lactate, Panthenol, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 60, Lecithin, Pullulan, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Silica, Fragrance\\*",

I'm an ER doctor, and if I have a chaotic day, esp when I have to perform a sterile procedure which involves putting on a gown and bonnet, I sweat like no other, both from the heat and the stress. \n\nPrevious to COVID, I was typically able to smell my own non-antiperspirant deodorant and Bath and Body Works lotion, even when I got a little sweaty. I had a baby in the time right before COVID hit, and had, to me, noticeabIy bigger and more pendulant breasts. During COVID, when things were really dicey and I was having long, agonizing days and doing lots of procedures, I started to note an unpleasant odor after ungowning or dealing with really stressful cases back-to-back. I don't know if others noticed, because no one mentioned it to me, but I certainly did and it bothered me. On days when I noted the odor, I was reluctant to reach for things, as I did not want to offend co-workers. I was concerned that the change in breast size could be cause for new odor, and tried putting Bath and Body Work lotion in between and under my breasts to help keep the odor at bay, with only mild improvement. I noticed that after a difficult day, I would still have the unpleasant odor, though less strong , and when I got home, it was apparent that I had sweated off the flowery scent of the lotion to reveal the musky-scented base, especially in the cleavage. \n\nWhen Lume came out, I decided to give it a try despite the unappealing ads about the embarrassing \"down there\" feminine smell (the OB/gyn who invented this clearly did not examine enough sweaty testicles in her off-rotations in residency). Surprisingly, it kept the unpleasant odor away, even on overwhelming days. When discussing the pros and cons of this product, I have to say that the lotions all have a underlying sickly sweet smell, that is not the best. However, with wear the sweet scent decreases, and I still find it more pleasant than my sweaty odor. I like the smell of the deodorant stick better, but it doesn't go on well in the between and under-boob areas. Because I wasn't crazy about Lume's lotion scent, I tried one of Native's spray-on deodorants after a commercial bragged that it lasted 72 hours. I really liked the smell, but for me it unfortunately did not even last 3/4 of a shift. So, I'm still using Lume at this time, and occasionally surfing the web to find superior options. I will look into glycolic acid products, but am unsure if it's usable in the breast area. If anyone has experience with this, I would love to hear about it.",

    "body": "Long time lurker, first time sharing. As of Feb 2025, I've been gastritis free for an entire year. Here is my story:\n\n### How it started\n\nIn Feb 2023, I had food poisoning twice plus two rounds of antibiotics for a UTI. One day I woke up and felt so nauseous that I couldn't eat. And when I did, my stomach felt like it was being poked by a thousand needles. \n\n### Symptoms\n\nBloating 24/7, with nonstop burping, indigestion, loose stools, acid reflux, metallic taste on my tongue (some days it even appeared gray). Got checked for H. Pylori which came back negative. \n\n### Diagnosis\n\nAfter multiple failed rounds of PPI's, in Oct 2023 I finally got an upper endoscopy that showed \"non-erosive mild chronic inflammation.\" My GI specialist diagnosed me with \"dyspepsia\" which later I learned isn't an actual diagnosis, but a symptom. \n\n### Medications\n\nPantoprazole - helped my symptoms for a bit, but they would always come back with a vengeance, and the constant burping never went away. Ultimately stopping PPI's and being extremely strict about diet is what allowed my stomach to heal, with the help of a few key supplements.\n\n### Supplements\n\nDGL Licorice Root (Natural Factors) \n\nhttps://a.co/d/3SI1fAZ\n\nSlippery Elm Bark Powder (Starwest Botanicals) \n\nhttps://a.co/d/dMj3pyp\n\nPure L-Glutamine (Naked Glutamine)\n\nhttps://a.co/d/jk2ffZn\n\nPlant Protein Powder (Garden of Life)\n\nhttps://a.co/d/aAMfgkV\n\nAloe Vera Juice (George's Aloe Vera)\n\nhttps://a.co/d/0ZrkHll\n\nProbiotics (Culturelle)\n\nhttps://a.co/d/dlt6Ggk\n\nOmega-3 (Nordic Naturals)\n\nhttps://a.co/d/7FjdP8t\n\n### Diet\n\nI ate 4-5 small meals per day with stomach protectants (DGL and Slippery Elm) beforehand. I started with just 5 ingredients and slowly added more, using a color coded spreadsheet to keep track of how I felt after eating. A typical day would look like this:\n\n**9:00am:** one DGL chewable & 12oz aloe vera with L-glutamine powder\n\n**9:30am:** 12oz alkaline water with slippery elm\n\n**10:00am:** bok choy, 2 scrambled eggs, mushrooms \n\n**11:00am:** 16oz smoothie with almond milk, blueberries, strawberries, vanilla extract, manuka honey, plant protein, hemp hearts \n\n**1:00pm:** DGL & slippery elm \n\n**1:30pm:** whole wheat sourdough with peanut butter & manuka honey \n\n**3:00pm:** handful of nuts with overnight oats\n\n**6:00pm:** DGL & slippery elm \n\n**6:30pm:** homemade chicken noodle soup with bone broth, buckwheat noodles, miso paste, bok choy, chicken & mushroom dumplings \n\n**8:00pm:** Culturelle probiotic + Omega-3 + one serving of fruit \n\n**10:00pm:** Chamomille tea with manuka honey \n\n**Ingredients I avoided:**\n\n- Anything spicy or carbonated \n- All spices except salt & pepper\n- All seed oils  \n- Tomatoes \n- Red meat \n- Chocolate \n- Nightshades \n- Cruciferous vegetables \n- Crunchy foods like potato chips\n- All processed snacks \n- Chewing gum (especially spearmint)\n\n**Ingredients I liked:**\n\n- Low acidity fruits (bananas, golden kiwis, papaya, melons, Bosc pears) \n- Salmon \n- Any white fish\n- All shellfish\n- Olive oil & avocado oil\n- Mushrooms \n- Tofu\n- Chicken breast (had to chew a LOT before swallowing!) \n- Chickpeas\n- Plant-based ricotta \n- \"Activated\" or sprouted almonds \n- Walnuts (with banana bread!) \n- Unsweetened almond milk \n- 100% peanut butter (no additives) \n- Whole wheat bread\n- Brown rice\n- Ancient grains (farro, quinoa, buckwheat)\n- Maple syrup\n- Manuka honey \n- Liquid aminos\n- White miso paste\n- Herbs (oregano, coriander, rosemary, thyme, parsley, cilantro, sage, basil, ginger)\n\n### Healing\n\nAfter a month of sticking to this diet, I began to see results. Slowly at first, then exponentially over the next 8-12 months. I followed several recipes from LG Capellan's book with success and highly recommended the banana oat pancakes!\n\nBy Feb 2024, a year later, I was enjoying sausage pizza with soda and chocolate chip cookies with zero pain. Although I still have occasional tiny flareups (usually from eating too soon before bed), I'll take some DGL with Slippery Elm the next day and feel totally fine. \n\nToday, it's Feb 2025 and I haven't thought about gastritis in a long time. Throughout my gastritis journey I felt many emotions—helplessness, anger, injustice, jealousy, hope, and disappointment. But now looking back, I can appreciate the lessons it taught me about listening to my body and building a healthier relationship with food. \n\nTake care of yourself, mentally and physically. The pain is not forever. Your body will heal. ❤‍🩹\n",

I also just made a “healed” post. https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/s/aoPKa0BDRE For me it was huge to make sure the food I was handling was actually filling me up and had enough fat and protein. And, of course, avoid the classic offenders for a long time. I haven’t thought about gastritis in a few months now, it’s crazy to look back at how lost I was and how much I’ve grown through this experience. I’m not 100% yet and I’ll definitely be taking some of your advice! It also helped me to go back to three bigger meals per day, seemed like it made my system work properly again. I kind of explain my reasoning in my post but I think your stomach acid should work on the fats and proteins for a while, feel full, send the right signals to your other organs, etc. A lot of people on here suffer from nervous system issues, anxiety etc from their lack of filling meals for an extended period of time. Maybe you have some thoughts on that and/or navigated that in a healthy way. Meds and supps didn’t seem to work for me but I may try some of the supplements you mentioned to coat my stomach lining. I’m so glad this worked for you, thanks for the post and the ideas!",

But when I had gastritis this worked against me, since having an empty stomach meant the acid had nothing to work on which made things worse. The key for me was keeping my stomach filled but not overly full. Feeling full made me really bloated and caused nonstop burping, so smaller meals that left me about 50% satiated worked best.

I tried to accept my chronic illnesses and disabilities.\n\nI thought I had irritable bowel. Through a completely random event, I discovered an issue called \"histamine intolerance\".\n\nIt turns out that all of the healthy food I was advised to eat, was making me incredibly ill: tomatoes, avocadoes, yogurt, saurkraut, spinach and on and on it's all very high in histamine.\n\nI tried a low histamine diet from the mastcell360 site and within a day, my gut suddenly became... completely normal. My bowel movements became as regular and easy as a metronome: put food in the top end and it comes out the bottom end in a timely and regular fashion. I immediately ceased all laxative, aloe vera juice and prune intake. (Prunes are very high in histamine!) The constant sense of nausea very slowly went away. Almost every day, my energy levels increase. Sometimes I have bad days and I feel like I've really been through the ringer but the general trend is extremely positive. It's been around 8 weeks and I've been trying to lower my migraine meds for many years due to side effects, but the withdrawals were terrible; In the last 8 weeks I cut my dose in half. Last Friday I deliberately skipped a dose to see how it went; last night I actually FORGOT my dose and didn't wake up with a migraine. That's a first\n\nI'm almost 50 years old. i've had terrible migraines my entire life. when I was young I was extremely thin but as an adult I became fairly obese. It didn't seem to matter what I did, what i ate, or how much I exercised and exercise was a trigger so trying to maintain weight was extremely difficult.\n\nWIthin literally a few days of going low histamine, I looked in the mirror and started to recognize myself. The bloating disappeared; I can see my cheekbones for the first time in decades. My pants fit very loosely, they just hang off. It turns out I'm really not obese; it was some sort of bloating and water retention, I guess, from the histamine.\n\nIt also turns out that exercise causes a rise on histamine. Everything makes sense for the first time in my life. I understand why I have to be careful to only exercise a little, and not push it. Another symptom that may be connected is that I've become ridiculously intolerant to cold weather; it doesn't matter so much how many layers I have on. I live in Canada, so I have essentially become allergic to my entire country. I'm really hoping this goes away.\n\nIt might be possible in time that I can start reintroducing histamine foods as the inflammation goes down; the diet is very limited.\n\nI feel like myself again, i guess, for the first time in a quarter century. It's been an awfully long hard ride\n\nThere may be some connection between low gut acidity and histamine intolerance. I take Webers Digestive Enzymes 30 mins before meals and this also helps. \n\nbest wishes to all\n\nLink to a low histamine food guide: (this is the best one I've found, there may be some misinformation on the interwebs)\nhttps://mastcell360.com/low-histamine-foods-list/",

But I avoid the really high histamine culprits like aged and blue cheese, alcohol, fermented foods, too much tomato sauce. And tyramine, which gives me headaches.\n\nPlus , I take a high amount of vitamin C for keeping my histamine levels low and supplements for building DAO and HNMT.\n\nBut: There´s always a root cause of HI, that depends on the person. Might be hormonal, gut-related, vitamin or mineral deficiency, MCAS, thyroid...there are many types of root causes for HI.\n\nI never could completely avoid migraines, even with low histamine and many supplements. Mine is triggered by hormonal imbalance (which I currently work on) and sleep plus weather and of course stress plays a huge role in this as well. I have a 2000 times higher risk of getting a migraine when I get my period. And if I have one or two nights of bad sleep around that time? Boom, migraine.\n\nThis hormonal imbalance also worsens HI and makes it ten times worse before my period.\n\nI completely believe you, that eating high histamine made you migraines a 1000 times worse. I also messes up the hormones, if that is a problem for you too.\n\nFor me, there is a connection between migraines and HI. It looks different for everyone and not everybody might be able to completely \"heal\" migraines with a low-histamine diet.\n\nI just wanted to emphasize this as a very restrictive diet over a long time can cause problems too and worsen migraines by creating vitamin and mineral imbalances in the body.\n\nOh and in your case: I  would get my thyroid checked.

My intent here is to try and see if the low histamine diet will actually be a cure for me. The results in such a short period of time are a miracle for me personally.

Also, as you mentioned, it's more like finding a good balance. If my histamine level is low (after following the diet for a few days already), I can eat a little bit of it and it's okay.\n\nAnd I don't really want to promote alcohol and I don't know if it's a myth. But gin is said to be low in histamine 😉",

So as the gut gets irritated, it can become more sensitive to histamine levels.

So because of that I started drinking liquid IV, first off, super expensive. Secondly, I can't drink it anymore because I'm on spironolactone. \n\nSo now I've been drinking aloe water 1-2 times a day on top of when I remember to drink water and  I have been feeling much more hydrated and less constipated. Yay! Very cheap as well, aloe plant only cost 1 dollar a stalk.\n\nHow to make aloe water:\n\n1. Wash aloe stalk and cut it into pieces\n\n1b.(optional) cut off sides to remove thorns\n\n2. Soak in warm water for 30 minutes\n\n3. Drain water and soak again for 1-3 hours \n\n4. Cut aloe flesh out and boil in water for at least 5 minutes.  \n\n5. Let cool, can be chilled or drank like tea. \n\n(You can make a big pitcher's worth of it, but that'll require more time to boil, you would use half of the aloe Leaf pieces in this case)\n\n\nIt also has a super subtle taste, the test is even less noticeable if it's cold, which is how I drink it. Anyway yall should try it, easy way to get hydrated.\n.\n.\n\nExtra stuff and warnings:\n\n\nEdit: you guys can always buy aloe water but it's a bit more concentrated store bought so you might find yourself with an upset stomach if you drink to much. *So don't drink to much when you buy it at the store.*\n\nAlso if you do this please don't skip any steps, the soaking is to draw out the irritants in the aloe latex. So if you don't soak it you can also get an irritated stomach. \n\nYou can just soak it for 3 hours and not drain it at 30 mins, I just find that it draws more of the latex out that way. \n\n*There is also NUUN for the spiro folks who can't drink liquid iv anymore*\n.\n.\n.\n\n*Allergies/medication warnings mentioned*\n\nEdit 2: Hello friends, something has been brought to my attention! If you have a latex allergy please do not try this! If you have a faux sugar allergy do not get the store bought versions! If you are on a NON-POTASSIUM SPARING DIURETIC (so NOT spironolactone) please speak to your doctor before drinking this. Also Aloe is toxic to pets please keep them away from the plant 🥰\n\nI'm seeing a lot of folks say this was to many steps and they aren't going to read the rest, it actually kind of hurt my feelings. lol but if you once again really do not want to do this but still want the benefits, *you can buy the aloe vera juice and water it down.*",

    "body": "Hey guys!\n\n Soo thanks to /u/the_acid_queen and /u/holysnails I was inspired a few months ago to take the leap and stop just reading about DIY and just DO IT. Two massive orders from Lotioncrafter later (as well as various smaller ones from GoW and Amazon), I can definitely say I'm hooked. **But I really want to emphasize that despite countless hours spent on /u/DIYbeauty, Chel and Alli's blog, Susan Barclay's blog Point of Interest, and many other resources as well as practice I am very much a beginner. It takes a long long time to really master DIY skincare because when it comes down to it, it really is a science. If you're not fully prepared to do your research, buy the right equipment and supplies, and proceed with the utmost caution then don't bother. There are countless amazimg ready made products out there for you. If you are prepared though, AWESOME. Let's get started.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPhew. Now that that's out of the way, I just wanted to say that I never even thought to post about this until now because (1 I didn't think anyone would be interested and 2) what could I possibly have to teach someone? All the interest in the recent post on DIY made me realize that this is a topic you guys want to hear about and I started to think that maybe my perspective as a beginner could be valuable. So I'll be posting some easy peasy beginner recipes below which are a great starting point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supplies and getting started**\n\nI highly recommend [this post](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/02/16/fun-with-diy-beginners-recipe-shopping-list/) from Alli at her blog The Acid Queen, it lists all the measuring and mixing supplies you'll need, some info on preparing your work area, and a great beginner's essence recipe. She wrote this after I'd already gotten started with DIY but I had picked her brain via email on stuff to get so I can testify that she's spot on with her list. If you don't have a kitchen mixer and don't want to spend the money on one, you can get a stick blender for under $10 which Susan from POI recommends. I got the Mini Mixer from Lotioncrafter for $20. You can even buy those little miniature kitchen whisks off Amazon if you're making something without an oil phase but you'll definitely want an electrical mixer once you move onto to formulations where you're combining water and oil phases. Also, I use [this scale] (http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-0-01g-Digital-Scale/dp/B0012LOQUQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1461054126&sr=8-1&keywords=American+Weigh+100g+x+0.01g+Digital+Scale+by+American+Weigh) which Chel recommended on her blog. It's under $10 and it's great, just get the 100g calibration weight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for as actual ingredients, I highly recommend Lotioncrafter. They have excellent customer service and fair prices. While you might be able to shop around and get better prices on some things, the quality might not be there. I feel comfortable vouching for Lotioncrafter because I know their ingredients are good qualify. Other places you can check out are Bulk Actives, Ingredients to Die For, and Skin Actives. I use GoW for oils but they also have other ingredients. In the past Chel has linked the Taiwanese site Skin Essential Actives on her blog but just a heads up, I've heard lots of reports of really poor service recently.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for as WHICH ingredients, that's going to depend on you and what you want to make. I would browse Point of Interest to get an idea of which ingredients you'll need for which kinds of recipes. Off the top of my head my first order I believe I got... distilled water, aloe vera juice, hydrosols, glycerin, propylene or butylene glycol, hylauronic acid, MAP, niacinamide, NAG, various extracts, oils, emulsifying wax, a preservative and a few others. Basically you need your water phase (distilled water is totally fine but I like to use aloe and hydrosols too), your oil phase (oils and then an emulsifier if you're combining oil and water), some goodies for your skin (humectants, extracts, niacinamide, Vitamin C, etc), and preservative. **Preservatives are NOT optional**. The only time you don't need one is of your product contains only oils and no water. It's okay to get cheap stuff like aloe juice, sodium lactate or PCA, hydrosols, glycerin, etc. You can stick them in everything and still get good results. Oh and get a complete emulsifier, like BTMS-50, Lotionpro, Ecomulse, or E Wax so you don't have to mess with the HLB system. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Beginner Recipes**\n\nOkay, if you got through all that we can finally get started lol. These are all super easy recipes that I've made before. I'm going to stick to stuff relevant to AB but if there's interest I'd be happy to post some more complex stuff I've made as well as other beginner friendly recipes as well. The first three don't container water so there's no preservative needed and you can just heat till melted through. The cleansing water though requires a preservative and you need to heat and hold for 20 minutes (see Alli's blog for more info on that).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING BALM WITH VASELINE\n\n*50% Vaseline (petroleum jelly)*\n\n*24% light oil (I used grape seed)*\n\n*15% Cromollient SCE*\n\n*10% IPM*\n\n*1% Vitamin E (optional, extends the shelf life of oils)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeigh out ingredients, combine, and heat. Melt and stir until melted through. Allow to cool then whip and transfer to jar. You can fancy it up by adding .5% of an essential oil or using a mix of oils for the 24% oils. Castor oil is a great oil to use in any cleansing oil or balm due to it's cleansing products. You don't want to use expensive oils because they're just getting washed off so you want to select affordable oils that have some slip so they work well when you're massaging your face. I chose light oils to lighten up the Vaseline and the IPM (Isopropyl Myristate, it's an ester) really reduces that greasy feeling.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING BALM WITH E WAX\n\n*96.5% heavier oils (I used rice brand, apricot kernel, and avocado)*\n\n*2.5% emulsifying wax*\n\n*1% Vitamin E (optional, extends the shelf life of oils)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeight out ingredients, combine, and heat. Again, stir until melted through and allow to cool. Whip until smooth and scrape into jar. So again feel free to do a mix of oils if you want to make it more complex. Some tea tree oil would make it a little astringent or you can use something nourishing like carrot seed essential oil.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBTW, [here](http://m.imgur.com/a/nIUN2) are some pictures of how they turned out when I made both versions the other day just for fun. I made these two just because that's what I had on hand to create a cleansing oil that was a balm consistency. I'll be ordering some more stuff soon and making a cleansing balm with more of the same ingredients as many AB balms and will update then.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING OIL RECIPE\n\n*84-89% oils (whatever you prefer)\n\n*10-15% Cromollient SCE*\n\n*1% Vitamin E (optional, extends the shelf life of oils)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeigh out ingredients into bottle and then shake. Done. This isn't even really a recipe, it's common knowledge but I think I'd include it for anyone who didn't know. If you want it to wash off cleanly, use 15% Cromollient. If you want some moisterizing effects use 10% Cromollient. Then adjust the oils to make sure your total is 100%. Just use this as a base and tweak it to suit your needs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING WATER\n\n*74% water (I used a mix of aloe vera juice and distilled water)\n\n*15% Cromollient SCE*\n\n*10% glycerin*\n\n*1% germaben (or other preservative of your choice at suggested amount)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCombine ingredients, heat at 70C for 20 minutes, then bottle. The preservative gets added once it's cooling down and if you used any extracts or heat sensitive ingredients you'd add them then too. I ran out of my Simple Micellar Water and figured I'd just make my own instead of paying $10 at CVS for another bottle. This is really easy to modify too. Because you're using a cotton pad with it and it's staying on your skin, it's not a waste to add extracts and other fun stuff. You can use a hydrosol instead or in addition to the aloe vera juice. I'm almost done with my first tester batch and I'll be adding niacinamide and chamomile extract to the next one to make it more like the Simple one. If you add anything just subtract it from the water so you still total 100%. I would keep some distilled water in there to keep it from feeling sticky.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm going to end it here because this is already insanely long. Let me know in the comments if you'd like me to do another post on how I make my body oil, facial oil, PH adjusting toner mist, and brightening essence. I've made some serums but I used Shark Sauce as a base so I don't feel comfortable posting them but I'm working on a serum with MAP that I can share once I'm done tweaking it. And this week I'll be playing around with facial milks and sleeping packs so I can post those too. I just typed this all up super quick and on the spot so sorry if it's all crazy, might have to edit some.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

My body oil is loosely based on the POI post about duping the Nuetrogena body oil. Never tried their body oil myself but I absolutely despise anything  greasy on my skin. So I use 30% IPM and it absorbs beautifully. I also use 5% Cromollient so I can apply it after a shower when my skin is damp and it turns kinda milky. It's another super simple one you can't possibly mess up but it's so nice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor facial oil, I'll probably go over which oils you should choose based on your skin and when.you'll be applying the oil in your routine. I get occasional pimples but mostly just have clog prone skin  and I apply my oils as my last serum step so I use a blend of high linoelic fruit seed oils. Then sometimes I'll use a mix of FCO, mineral oil, rice bran, and petroleum jelly at the very end to seal it in but I'm working on an actual sleeping pack. Oh and I'll probably include some variations of the facial oil blend with Tetra C and another with bisbolol.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHmmmm.... for a balm with butters, I don't think you could use emulsifying wax. At least not at the percentage I used, it was super thick with 2.5% e wax and oils can't imagine how thick it would be with butters. I think you'd be better off just using butters and Cromollient SCE. But if you really want to try it with butters, I'd do a mix of butters and light oils with e wax. Or less e wax but add some Cromollient SCE so it still emulsifies well.",

It didn't even have an official sign on it, just the name and price handwritten in sharpie, so it must be super new. \n\n[Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer with aloe and green tea extract](http://imgur.com/a/q6TViPm) 75ml - $8.99\n\nIt's definitely one of their more expensive cosmetics but based on the ingredients it looks pretty good for the price. Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

This one is not super creamy, but not matte as well. It leaves a veryyyy slight white cast on application but goes away in like 5 to 7mins. Not water-resistant though, but I dont mind. From the swatches and reviews I've seen on instagram, both variants appear almost the same, so imo you would like it of you have combi to dry skin and prefer slightly moisturising sunscreens!",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

I tried the snail mucin from earth rhythm before this (simply, no and also coming up) and this is miles better than that. makes my skin very plumpy and soft . of course top it off with a gel and completes the routine on a lazy day lol. soothes all acne irritation and dryness . not sure how it will work on oily skin but a goody for all sensitive ,acne prone and dry bishes.\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Earth Rhythm Renew Overnight Gel with 70% Snail Mucin**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 900 for 50ml (bought for Rs. 600) from nykka\n\n**humectants** : snail mucin , hyaluronic acid, aloe vera juice and acetamido ethoxyethanol\n\n**for skin types** : normal and oily\n\n**texture and appearance** : cloudy thin gel . feels kind of watery . unscented.\n\nwhat a waste of money. 1 out of 2 earth rhythm products I tried and both of them broke me out and are clown realness  🤡. it feels like thin coat of Vaseline on the face and even though its a sleeping mask its not hydrating (thought id mention it in essences since its the only sleeping mask w/ humectants I have lol) and sure as hell doesn't calm the skin. made my acne worse and just doesn't fulfill its purpose. wouldn't recommend to anyone .\n\n**status** :  not in use\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**serums**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nget ready for a bandwagon of hyaluronic acid variations XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**minimalist hyaluronic acid 2% + vitamin B4**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 500) from beminimalist\n\n**humectant**: hyaluronic acid, aloe vera juice, panthenol, propanediol and ethoxydiglycol.\n\n**for skin types** ; all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick clear liquid . unscented .\n\nhydrating goodness! first was using it on dry skin but works the best on damp skin. absorbs really quickly and was my first hyaluronic acid serum. used more than required so ran out of it pretty quickly but around  5 drops are enough for the whole face. great for anyone really , so versatile!\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**deconstruct hydrating serum**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 30ml (bought for Rs. 500) from amazon\n\n**humectants** : hyaluronic acid , butylene glycol, anhydroxylitol , xylitol , xylitylglucoside  and sodium gluconate\n\n**for skin types** : all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick clear liquid kind of like cosrx snail mucin . unscented but mine somehow had a cardboard like smell .\n\ngood! overall I had a better experience with minimalist . this serum was just a bit too heavy and greasy for me . it took a really long time for it to absorb and sometimes just sat on the skin. and plus the smell was a bit nauseating . but al in all , it gave good hydration . stinged a bit when skin was irritated so not the biggest fan of this.\n\n**status** : not in use\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neutrogena hydro boost capsule in serum**\n\n**Mrp :** Rs. 800 for 30 ml (bought for Rs. 720) from nykka\n\n**humectants :** glycerin, propanediol, butylene glycol, caprylyl glycol, panthenol, hyaluronic acid , sucrose and pca.\n\n**for skin types** : all! dry, sensitive, oily , combo and acne-prone\n\n**texture and appearance** : thin gel like . capsules are powdery but when mixed with gel , they disappear. heavily scented so wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin.\n\nliteral money-bait. did absolutely nothing. and felt so guilty after buying it ! its alternative hydro boost gel was so much better!

HG moisturizer besides Cetaphil DAM (cheaper alternative) . boon for sensitive and dehydrated skin. skin saver during my whole tretinoin journey. extremely hydrating and soothing. works similar to boroline on dry patches around nose and mouth . and non-pore clogging! admittedly a little heavy and non-absorbing which is why I might not use it in summers.\n\n**status** : still in use\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all from my side !!also I did not use all of these products at the same time. I'm writing everything from memory since some products were used +3 years ago . even those still in use, I alternate between them on days since I don't need to apply them everyday and all. so most of my products last for a very long time since I combined them and alternate between them. of course, patch test first and thankfully, none of them reacted in a bad way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsuggestions from the subreddit \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfollowing products were subreddit recs and I haven't used them at all , so ya'll can search more about them an maybe give them a try!\n\n* irem hyaluronic acid serum (HA)\n* pyungkang yul mist toner\n* inkey list polyglutamic acid\n* herbivore cloud jelly serum\n* the ordinary NMF moisturizer\n\nthere are a lot more but I'm too lazy to read all of them . do mention your HG in the comments!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthere are many other humectants that I haven't mentioned , like niacinamide which is present in trace amounts in almost all products. personally, never tried any products with honey extract in it (I figured snail mucin does a better job , but who knows) . for newer products, ill update them one I'm done trying them for at least 2 months (or let me know if you guys want it any earlier , I got no issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway I hope this list helps out ! I didn't have any knowledge about humectants while my skin was being tortured by over-exfoliation and I was looking like a baboon's ass so take care of your skin so it doesn't look like this 🥵 also this took a long time , so leaving an upvote will feel nice 🥰",

    "body": "After 4 years of being natural,some trauma in my scalp that are healing. I’m pleased to inform I have reached the comfortable hair length. It should be more, but I wasted the first 2 years really bad…(won’t get into details💀)\n\nFinally lately Ive been prioritizing 2 things, the health of my scalp and the health of my ends \n\nHow long your hair grow each month? I suspect mine is the typical average of half an inch. However I increase it when I massage every night and take my vitamins, even my nails are flourishing. (I only know my hair rate is increasing when I go back to scalp massage and vitamins bc my nails grow Longgg)\n\nFigure out your hair porosity (mine is low) and the average grow rate of your hair \n\nMeasure your hair. Both now and when you finish the braids, use a T-shirt etc. You have to measure it at the end of month or after 4 weeks to see how much it grew. It have to be half an inch or an inch, if it less idk ma boy.\n\nI’m doing a 1 month/4 week protective style challenge. In which I let the braids, cornrows or twist for 4 weeks. I tried multiple times and now I know what to fix.\n\nI choose normal sized braids for my challenge, because when is too small it get matter faster and take longer take down\n \nScalp:\n\nI will be moisturizing my scalp (ONLY) the first 2 weeks with Dove Scalp Serum. Last 2 with either tea rinse in spray bottles, or aloe Vera juice, then seal with rosemary oil or Peppermint oil. (Making sure to not rube in, simply apply,massage for like two minutes and cover with satin scarf and bonnet then massage with scalp\nMassager. It don’t mess my hair when I do this so it don’t get matted.)\n\nI scalp massage every night with bonnet on and scalp massager. And idk if I’m crazy but I swear it works. \n\nIn week 4, I will take down the braid body and let the start of it so I don’t lose the parting. Section in 8, then wash my scalp with a clarifying shampoo then moisturize. Deep condition etc. I said this here already I seal with silicon products after I moisturize. I use an oil with silicon or cream at the ends. It works wonders for my 4c hair man is insane the change. If I’m having problem detangling of course afro Prepoo or flaxseed gel, but if I’m lazy a conditioner with Silicone. Pantene work the best for me, I get the job done in minutes!\n- Silicon sealants:\n• Silicon Mix Bambu Hair Polisher\n• John Frieda Frizz Ease Serum\n\nThen I let all the care/leave in sit for 1 or 2 day (in chunky twist) Then I blow dry WITH HEAT PROTECTANT 💀 With silicones. Yes. Chi Silk Infusion is my go to. and braid again (the parts I kept in (that I didn’t unbread) one by one.\n\nIf you prefer do twist, I did is cute, matted is minimum last month bc I blow Dried, it was pretty, a good length so I went out with it! But even the prior month to this I had very shrunken twist bc I put water everyday and I still end out with it! Cute ponytails with some extra down. Was fine But nah, I get bored with twist fast. So cornrows in the front and braids in the back, is so prettyyy! But next time I’ll braid the front too, I still look pretty either ways honestly. 🙂‍↕️ Go out with your natural hair in your protective style, TRUST! The shine and confidence is unmatched. Don’t lay no edges too, just add some golden hair accessories or silver and rock it. DO IT👹\n( i will put myself in the comments so you can see, but will delete it after some hours. )\n\nEnds:\nCut the ends till is clean. With a SHEAR scissor 💀💀💀\nDon’t leave it because is ugly,useless and not even hair anymore. I call it grass cutting lmao.\n\nWhile doing the braids I put each flaxseed gel on the cut clean ends, and after the section is finished, the ends are hard and protected\n\nThen  I go with a clean bead or fold (the golden decorative ones are easier just curve and wrap) I prefer beads. I don’t curve my ends, but I make sure a long part of my ends is up and curve where my hair is already thick then I go with a rubber band and tie it,then cover my end (a little more always should be left) and cover with other more beads, like 3 or 4 or a very long one!\n(In summer I will use shells though. So pretty!)\n\nThis keeps my hair straightened and elongated, it even prevents it from rubbing each other which keeps it  all neat and clean. \n\nIt keeps my ends extremely protected and safe both from the beads and from rubbing each other.  After 4/6 weeks, when taking down simply take the loose part of the rubber band, with the small shear scissor cut it. Then take it out. Be of course extremely careful lmao, which is why I leave a loose part, I put my ends very up to not even touched it while managing the braid too.  idk how to explain this sorry. Will show when I’m taking down.\n\nIf you want other options:\n- Easy Beads. Is like a clip in beads, but I don’t like that is 3 in one. I plan to create my own perfected easy beads, safe length for my taste.\nI’m working on creating my own brand with the exact fabric,color and needs I have, will put in my google document Once finished. \n\n- Silicone Beads. Look the same, don’t make any noise, pretty and simple. You can cut the bead directly too, more safe.\n\n-Just the Flaxseed keep it moisturized and hard for the weeks, put in a high LOOSE ponytail with a SATIN tie. The safe beads or folds is just for my anxiety little self that NEED to keep my ends out of touch🥹I used to break it by myself…is like eating nails for me. So I put myself on time out by locking it away with beads/folds etc.\n\nOkay so scalp is cleaned after 4 week, hair is conditioned too. Ends are moisturized, hardened and kept away for 4 weeks too.\n\nThen after this we repeat.\n\nI wish I could go 2 months, but my hair can’t. And that’s okay! But if you can do 2 months,even better. Don’t put water in your 4c braids during the 4 weeks, remember all the sprays are for your SCALP only 💀 If you don’t want to end up with a matting world like me before lmao. If you want to add something in your braids, just oil the body of the braid. But then again, don’t put nothing. \n\nThis challenge is for 6 months before I take all down and wash then do cute hairstyles to enjoy my length 🤭\n\nAlso, I will be recording myself in the 4 weeks to hold myself accountable. \n\nAnyways there’s so much more. But I’m doing a big document for every 4c hair person level of availability. If you are a lazy natural with medium length and low porosity who wants a simply routine I have the perfect routine for that. Or this type of extended stuff that I enjoy a lot, I fuck with my hair hard, love it a lot. But when I was going to college everyday I had an extremely simple routine to be cute, functional and keep my hair healthy and protected while it grew.\n\nSo I know most people prefer to keep 4c hair in a simply routine. My goal is for people with 4c hair that want to take care of it, but don’t have time can have access to how their hair works, what can protect their fragile ends, what hairstyles and routines are quick, beautiful and protecting. With low Price products, (silicon products that protect your ends are like 20 dollars and less in dollar stores like Pantene. Aloe Vera juice is affordable,rinse tea the same! )\n\nOr some obsessed like me to have access to longer regimens. And track our growth!\n\nAnd most importantly to love,enjoy it and go out with your hair without edges or added hair. Anyways goodbye.🌨️",

    "body": "I've been receiving a lot of comments on past posts on this subreddit. I figured I'd make one final post about my condition, what helped, and how I'm doing today. \n\n**Symptom onset:** July 17, 2023\n\n**CT Scan:** July 20, 2023\n\n**Endoscopy:** August 11, 2023\n\n**Diagnosis:** Mild, Chronic antral gastritis without H. pylori \n\n**Cause:** Unknown. Likely one Motrin before bed every night on an empty stomach and an expired aspirin once a week before symptoms started. The doctor who did my endoscopy also mentioned stress.\n\n**Symptoms at the time:** excessive belching, weight loss, complete loss of appetite, feeling full after eating just a little, burning stomach pain, acid reflux in throat, nausea, and extreme anxiety. \n\n  \n**What didn't help:** \n\n* Natural remedies alone didn't help me. I was terrified of taking a PPI, so I tried slippery elm, liquorice root, and aloe vera juice. My symptoms continued to get worse. \n* Also, an overly strict diet didn't work for me either. I had always loved food, but worrying over what was okay to eat and what wasn't helping. In fact, I started having panic attacks every time I ate, and I went from 112lbs to 99lbs.\n* Finally, obsessively checking this subreddit didn't help. I fell into a vicious cycle of seeking reassurance, panicking, and seeking more reassurance. I started having multiple panic attacks every day, cried all day, and could barely sleep, thinking I was actually dying of pancreatic cancer and not struggling with gastritis. I started believing doctors were lying to me. I was almost hospitalized in psych. This subreddit is awesome, but please don't let it consume you.\n\n  \n**What helped:** \n\n* A PPI (omeprazole 20 mg once per day for 7 months). Yes, that's a long time to be on a PPI, but I was on a relatively low dose. It took a good couple of weeks to start working, and I would say another 3 weeks until my appetite started coming back. I made sure to take it 30 minutes before eating in the morning. I started tapering off after 7 months and took it VERY slowly. I had some mild rebound symptoms, but now I'm good. There's a lot of fear mongering about PPIs, but I'm glad I eventually followed the doctor's orders and took them instead of trying to throw every natural remedy at my stomach. \n* Miso broth and chamomile tea helped a ton! Miso is fermented and has a lot of gut-healthy bacteria. It was very soothing to my stomach. \n* Zoloft. Yes, I started taking an SSRI. Yes, it's hard on your stomach at first. I made sure to take it on a full stomach. I strongly believe I wouldn't have fully healed without it because my anxiety was making my gastritis worse. It allowed me to eat more and stop having panic attacks all day. It did take a good 5–6 weeks to kick in, and yes, the anxiety temporarily got worse for a few weeks. Now, I have basically no anxiety, and I sleep like a dream. I'm back up to 115 lbs. \n* I stopped being extra strict with my diet and just followed how I was feeling. If it didn't hurt me, I ate it. If it did hurt, I didn't eat it. Doing this allowed me to get the nutrients and energy I needed to heal because white rice and boiled chicken just weren't cutting it. The only things I stopped eating for a few months were: tomatoes, lemons and other citrus fruits, alcohol, coffee, fried foods, and spicy foods. In September 2023, I was able to have half an alcoholic drink and a tiny bit of tomato-based chili without any symptoms. \n* After maybe 5 months of PPI, Zoloft, a semi-normal diet, and miso/chamomile to soothe my stomach, I was at 95% normal. So, what pushed me to 100%? A probiotic strain called S. boulardii. It's actually yeast, so be careful if you can't have yeasts. I used the Florastor brand OTC at Walmart. It did make me gassy the first few weeks, but then it was like a miracle. I took it once a day for months. It not only made my stool more consistent, but it also helped get rid of any leftover acid reflux. \n\n  \nSo, that's my story. I'll probably answer a few comments here and there, but I don't want to dwell on it too much. This was a horrifying chapter in my life, and I want to move past it. \"Mild\" gastritis did NOT feel mild, lol. I hope you all find some comfort in my story. It takes awhile, but recovery is possible. Hang in there!\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "You are so much me. Reading Reddit usually makes me feel worse too. I already had healthy anxiety.(I am getting help) I really scared to use ppi long time but I also scared that natural things. I didn’t drink Aloe vera juice aloe Vera isn’t even common plant where I live.  \nI recently diagnosed with pangastritis and I am strict on my diet but some people say don’t eat cheese (don’t eat that yellowish cheese even you are healthy)don’t eat yogurt a real yogurt not sweet ones(one of the best probiotic food). This that bla bla. \nWhat I want to ask is how did you manage to make stable  your iron, vitamin d and b12 even you used ppi long time?",

Take slow walks, enjoy a cup of chamomile tea, read, and take bubble baths or long showers. Whatever you can do to help your body and mind relax will help a lot! \n\nHonestly, I got my blood tested twice during PPI use, and I had zero issues with my iron and vitamin levels. Although 7 months of use is a long time, I don't necessarily think it's long enough to cause significant issues. I also don't think all people who use PPI end up with vitamin deficiencies. My mother is 75 and has been on them for 10 years. That's not ideal, but her blood work always comes back normal. \n\nFor food, like I said, I used my best judgement. If something hurt or made symptoms worse, I didn't eat it. Yogurt was fine for me. I would get the unsweetened Greek yogurt and add my own honey and walnuts. No two people are the same, so something that might inhibit healing one person might not do the same for you. For example, everyone online told me to stay away from seasonings, but I was fine with onions, garlic, italian herbs, paprika, salt, and cilantro. Making sure you have enough nutrients and energy is very important.   \n  \nIs the strict diet doctor prescribed? Are you taking a PPI?",

I'm still on 50mg, and it works great! I know some people need a higher dose, though. \n\n2. I'm not sure whether it was the gastritis or the anxiety, but I did have loose stool for a bit. Well, it was inconsistent stool -- something loose, sometimes airy, sometimes yellow, sometimes normal. It really caused me a lot of anxiety which, surprise surprise, caused me even more stool issues lol. The s.boulardii helped a ton! \n\n3. Yes, I am! I would say I've been 100% symptom-free since March. I was at around 90% for awhile, but I got to 100% around March. I can eat whatever I want now.

I think you can also get it in the states if that's where you are. I get the Gaviscon Advance liquid. It forms a barrier that stops acid from going up the throat, and it coats your stomach.

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "Here is the routine that my skin has come to make peace with since the last 8 months after years of perfunctory experiments it endured. I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

    "body": " \n\nThis is my first time doing a comparison post, so please bear with me. I really hope this post is well organised and everyone finds it an informational and entertaining read. I have been wanting to do this comparison since the minimalist released its peel, and I finally got the chance to that. I have uploaded a video and images for the comparison but I'll first start with the review.\n\nReview\n\n* *Your skin type-* Sahara desert dry skin\n* *Your current climatic conditions-* Hot af\n* *Your current AM/PM routine-*  \n**AM**\\- Nothing, I only apply sunscreen if have to go out  \n**PM**\\- Ponds cold cream (for my double cleanse), cleanser (Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser), tret (twice a week), ordinary peeling solution (once a month), innisfree jeju volcanic mask (once a month), moisturizer (I have like 4-5 moisturizers that I use)\n* *Your age- 22*\n\n**The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* More than a year\n* *Ingredient List-* Glycolic Acid, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Daucus Carota Sativa Extract, Propanediol, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Potassium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Polysorbate 20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n* *Holy Grail but Will Not Repurchase-* I fucking love it, it made my skin so smooth and my complexion brighter. I never had any skin problems before as such, but it just made everything better. I never experienced any sort of purging or irritation with this peel. Although, I will not be repurchasing it because I paid ₹1200 for this even though it lasted more than a year. The availability is an issue too.\n\n**Minimalist AHA BHA PHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* 2 times\n* *Ingredient List-* Aloe Vera Juice, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Gluconolactone, Mandelic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lecithin\n* *Holy Grail but Will Repurchase-* I loved it in the very first go, I saw immediate results much like the ordinary. I did not experience any sort of irritation or purging with this either. I honestly don't have much to say because the results are pretty much identical for both.\n\nComparison\n\n**Texture**\n\nAs you can see in the video below, apart from the colour difference the minimalist one a bit flowier than the ordinary. Also, I like the shape of the dropper of the minimalist one, it's pointy rather than the round tip and it looks classier ( at least to my eyes). That is really it when it comes to the texture and the feel of the products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/mobbuo/video/dxwg1bxpdes61/player\n\n**Application**\n\n*note- i forgot to take my before pics, pls forgive a newbie 😔😔😔*\n\nI did a half-n-half application of the peels. The immediate thing I noticed was the way they applied, ordinary being thicker is slightly easier to spread because it doesn't drip as much as the minimalist.\n\nAlso, idk what it is about minimalist peel but I had to apply it a tad bit more than its counterpart.\n\nThird, minimalist did not burn AT ALL while the ordinary always burns a little, even after a year of consistent use.\n\nIn the images below you can see my skin right after the application of the peels, the results are very much the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kdr544sdes61.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8425c82498afb958897ee5482979129fdc1c07d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion-** I like both, I don't have a preference for one over the other when it comes to the results. The only thing is that minimalist is cheaper and easily available, so I will go for that one instead of the ordinary.",

A no sugar, no fast food, super low carbs, no bread, no alcohol, wine or sugary drinks even fruit juices.\n\nThat’s number 1)\n\n\nAnd also second Probiotics, use two or three really good ones.\n\nThree really good probiotics to make it alive past your stomach acid are: \n\n• Saccharomyces Boulardii by Jarrow Formulas https://www.swansonvitamins.com/jarrow-formulas-inc-saccharomyces-boulardii-mos-90-veg-caps?SourceCode=INTL4071&showPopup=f\n\n• Balance One Probiotics https://balanceone.com/collections/all/products/probiotics\n\n•60 Billion Probiotic https://physicianschoice.com/collections/digestive-health-and-probiotics/products/probiotic-60-billion\n\nThat’s number 2)\n\n\nAnd third would be using some natural anti fungals\n\nLike \n\n• CandAssist https://balanceone.com/products/balance-one-candassist?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=candidaguide\n\n•CandidX https://m.professionalsupplementcenter.com/Candid-X-by-BioMatrix.htm?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=generic&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNeMupaL3pO1jsAbl5QeVeAGnffbm1yhL1d2G-kYYSirgZXJwuQ6X4saAiXdEALw_wcB\n\n•Ancien Nutrition: Candida https://store.draxe.com/products/ancient-herbals-candida?variant=32196863590470\n\n•Advanced Candid Formula https://www.chineseherbsdirect.com/products/advanced-formula-candida-90-ct-chinese-herbs-direct?gclid=CjwKCAjwuvmHBhAxEiwAWAYj-FJAL5A0B0z5fgnajYw5yel37u54lcKGPpXaltqIsWrqoB-FTwycqhoCJyUQAvD_BwE\n\nThat’s step 3:\n\n\nFinally if you could use something that helps your liver to detox and helps it along with purging your body from all the neuron toxins Candida gives off when it is dying. AND also break the biofilms (walls) of Candida, i would very much recommend a Champ: N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine \n\nIt does both jobs 👍😃 (i would take the N-Acetyl- right after you step 2, after your change your diet and have introduced at least 2 probiotics into your routine)\n\nHere is a super good NAC supplement, this is the one i use.  \n\n•Thorne NAC https://blueskyvitamin.com/products/cysteplus-500mg-90-capsules-thorne-research?variant=29360393617480&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&cmp_id=7774276923&adg_id=80341641974&kwd=&device=m&gclid=CjwKCAjw_JuGBhBkEiwA1xmbRY32xymHcGP1mFwDSYz3fOm4cK7WsuwJNbVzZe6wG1nT9eiSacUvVRoCzTYQAvD_BwE",

It’s hard because Candida mutates into different forms to protect itself. It adapts well to Fluconazole, and Nystatin, and it becomes drug-resistant. So we must battle it naturally, and with multiple sources, the Betaine will definitely help clear up your SIBO, aiding in fighting your candida. \n\n1) sugar/ carb free lifestyle \n\n2) supplements and fungicidal foods\n\n3) probiotics \n\nYou can do this man! 👍",

Promise \n\nThe first one sells you stuff but there are better supplements to start with, like the ones i left up on this original post.\n\nOkay here we go\n\n1) [CANDIDA... CAN MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS HELP?!](https://www.superfeast.com.au/blogs/superblog/candida-medicinal-mushrooms)\nCAUSES OF EXCESS CANDIDA\n\nThere are a whole bunch of phenomena that play a role in how your body's natural and healthy balance of candida can over-proliferate. In fact, it's our overall lifestyle and the environment in which we are interacting with that plays the biggest role in how candida presents itself...\n \nTHE MODERN AND CHRONIC USE OF ANTIBIOTICS\nAntibiotics are pharmaceuticals that lead to an upset within our microbiome, which can very quickly deplete our immune stores and lead to immune deficiencies. We understand life happens and you just can't get around taking a course of antibiotics. But we do need to consider the elephant in the room - antibiotics DO kill off your good gut bacteria. And a compromised immune system leads to the opportunistic ability of candida to overgrow. Remember, candida is a normal part of the human make-up, but it is an opportunistic yeast and as soon as the opportunity presents, candida will take control. Exposure to antibiotics or immunosuppressants, or corticosteroid-based medications create the perfect eco-system for candida to thrive.\n \nAN OVER RELIANCE ON HIGHLY PROCESSED, CARBOHYDRATE-RICH FOODS\nThe nature of Candida albicans is that it is fed by starch. If your carbohydrate consumption has been high (and the average Western diet is exactly this), then you are more susceptible to experiencing a candida overgrowth. Highly refined, starchy foods (think all the white stuff, bread, sugars, cakes, pastries etc) not only directly provide fuel for the candida, but they also undermine your immune system. So it's basically the double whammy. Unfortunately the sweet stuff provides fuel for yeast, mould, bacterias and fungus within the body. \n \nGUT DYSBIOSIS AND VIRAL LOAD\nIt is very rare that a candida overgrowth will appear solo. As we have discussed, a candida proliferation occurs when the opportunity arises; that opportunity is a weakened immune system. So generally, candida will be found with an overall gut dysbiosis, potentially there may be parasites present, there may be a heavy metal load happening; there is generally a viral and / or bacterial overload in the system too. While this isn't technically a cause, there are likely to be co-infections present which means your healing protocol will need to consider these.\n\n[What Is The Candida Diet?](https://www.thecandidadiet.com)\n\nQuote “One of the major causes of gut dysbiosis and fungal overgrowth is a diet full of sugary, processed, junk foods. These foods are high in sugars that feed a Candida overgrowth, and rich in pro-inflammatory ingredients that damage your gut and cause inflammation across your body. (2)”\n\nThis website also sells you supplements but they are really good, i now take two of them. The CandAssist is also a really good one for fighting Candida. They also have the probiotic i take, and the liver support to help cleanse the liver and aid it in helping flush out the toxins from the candida die-off.\n\nHere is the website for the BalanceOne supplement line.\n\n[BalanceOne](https://balanceone.com)",

I want to get to a place where i can eat desserts once in a while. Maybe once or twice a month, maybe just once a month. My candida is blown out of control so i can’t even eat buck wheat or qunioa. I’m on a super strict candida diet which is strict keto but even more disciplined.\n\nI have found some alternative foods and snacks that are totally healthy and give you 1-2 grams of carbs instead of 22 grans of carbs in quinoa, and 33.5 grams of carbs in buckwheat.\n\nThe thing is that Carbs turn to sugars if we don’t burn them up, so Candida eats them as food and it continues to grow. 😦",

    "body": "Most people don’t realize it, but one of the most powerful keys to staying young and living longer is hidden deep inside your body—your gut. Right now, trillions of microbes are living in your digestive system. They help break down food, support your immune system, and even talk to your brain. When this delicate community of microbes falls out of balance—a condition known as dysbiosis—your body starts to break down from the inside out. This isn't just about bloating or digestion problems. Dysbiosis is a root cause of aging.\n\nAs we get older, our gut loses its diversity. The good bacteria that protect us start to disappear, while harmful bacteria grow stronger. This microbial imbalance causes inflammaging—a constant, low-level inflammation that damages your cells, weakens your organs, and accelerates the aging of your brain, heart, skin, and immune system. Simply put: if your gut microbiome is aging badly, so are you. But the exciting truth is this: you can reverse this process by healing your gut.\n\nThe science is clear: people who live the longest—centenarians and super-agers—tend to have younger, more diverse gut microbiomes. This means they carry more beneficial microbes, lower inflammation, and absorb nutrients better. A healthy gut helps your body make vitamins, fight off diseases, balance hormones, and even keep your mind sharp. This isn’t just about gut health. It’s about living longer, healthier, and with more energy.\n\nWant to boost your gut and slow down aging? Start by eating more prebiotic fiber—the food your good bacteria love. Fill your plate with garlic, onions, leeks, bananas, oats, lentils, and apples. These foods feed the good microbes and help them grow stronger. Think of it as planting a garden inside your belly—nurture the soil, and you’ll get beautiful, lasting results.\n\nNext, bring in the reinforcements with fermented foods. Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, and kombucha are packed with living probiotic bacteria that settle into your gut and build a protective army. These foods don't just help digestion—they improve your mood, boost immunity, and reduce brain fog. Every spoonful is like adding years of life to your body.\n\nYou also need to cut out the enemies. Ultra-processed foods, sugar, artificial sweeteners, and fast food are like throwing poison into your gut garden. These substances feed the bad bacteria and destroy the healthy ones. Avoid foods with preservatives, sucralose, aspartame, and too much alcohol. These age you from the inside by increasing gut inflammation and destroying your protective gut lining.\n\nPolyphenol-rich foods are the secret weapons your microbiome needs. Berries, green tea, extra virgin olive oil, dark chocolate, and red grapes feed your beneficial bacteria and fight inflammation. They also help prevent chronic diseases like Alzheimer’s and cancer. When you eat these foods daily, you're not just snacking—you're choosing longevity.\n\nWant to go further? Try intermittent fasting to give your gut time to rest and reset. Just 12–16 hours a day without food (including overnight) allows your microbiome to recover and grow more diverse. You can also support your gut lining with L-glutamine, collagen peptides, zinc carnosine, and aloe vera juice. And if you’re healing from leaky gut or antibiotics, a broad-spectrum probiotic with many strains is a must.\n\nThe gut is where life begins, and it's where aging begins too. Take care of it like the sacred ecosystem it is. Breathe deeply. Sleep well. Spend time in nature. Pet your dog. Laugh more. Every good habit you build helps your gut—and your gut gives life back to you. If we want to live forever—or at least a lot longer—the gut microbiome is one of the greatest tools we have. Start today. Your future self will thank you.",

Your premise is wise and evidence based, but fermented foods and probiotics may only serve the benefit of competing with bad bacteria we already have. Just not enough data to know for sure. If you have an overactive immune response, fermented foods, mushrooms, dairy, certain nuts, etc could trigger inflammation. It’s personal and complicated. Anyone who fasts and goes carnivore will heal. Almost universally. What else you can get away with after that is based on how triggered your immune system is. \n\nA hospital in Germany does 3 week doctor monitored broth only fasts. People go into full remission of asthma for up to a year. 25% get full remission forever. Half get almost a year of remission after which histamines May regress. Just an example of how critical the immune system is in your argument. Cheers.",

    "body": "I will try to keep it as short as possible but keep in mind i've been trying to fight this for the better part of decade. I will write a TLDR at the end for those who just want to skip to the solution, although i recommend reading the whole thing since you might be making the same mistakes i did.\n\n**What kind of halitosis did i have?**\n\nIt evolved over the decade, it started as a normal bad smell only while speaking, a year or so later that morphed into the smell coming through my nose, 3 or 4 years ago i started to reek of the smell, it felt as if the smell was a cloud following me, people who pass by me cough or clear their throat, people sitting next to me would gradually start getting uncomfortable, touching their nose, taking a deep breath, letting a massive sighs.\n\n**Was it room filling?**\n\nIt wasn't room filling but there was an incident where my teammate complained 'the air was thick' and opened the windows in the office, so i suspect the smell escapes through my nose bit by bit and change the air quality although not enough to make it room filling.\n\n**What i tried with no success?**\n\nFirst thing is ofcourse start brushing after dinner as well, i only used to brush in the morning and also start tongue scrapping, also went to the dentist for cleaning, nothing worked, infact bb was getting worse, so i went to multiple dentists with no help, went to a general practitioner to check for anything wrong with my organs, he refused to test me saying i don't have halitosis, he suggested me to buy breath sprays for god sakes. This are the protocols i tried the following years:\n\n* *Went Sugar Free*\n* *Tonsillectomy*\n* *Coronectomy*\n* *Treating H. Pylori*\n* *Nasal Irrigation*\n* *10 Day Water Fasting*\n* *S-Acytl Glutathione*\n* *HCL Betain*\n* *Celery Juice*\n* *Aloe Vera Juice*\n* *Cabbage Juice*\n* *Anti Fungals*\n* *Candida Supplements*\n* *Endoscopy no issues*\n* *Carnivore Diet*\n\nI've basically bought and tried all the supplements people mentioned on these forums, nothing helped, one day i reached my finger down my throat and picked one of my tonsil stones, once i smelled my finger i knew this was 100% the issue behind my halitosis. I went for a Tonsillectomy, I was really excited after my the surgery, i thought that was the end of the journey, low and behold i didn't know it was going to get worse for me. In fact the bad breath didn't even decrease a bit, reactions were the same as before. As i wrote above the smell actually got worse as the years passed by.\n\n**So what changed?**\n\nI realized all this time i'm shooting in the dark, just seeing people claim something is working for them with no proof and here i go buying the supplement and trying it on myself, even if that thing worked i will never have the relief of it not coming back again, we need a reliable method based on numbers to solve this so if in case we relapse, we know how to tackle it with confidence.\n\nSo i decided to stop buying or trying things without testing myself first, that's the best thing i can tell you, test yourself, even in math understanding the problem is 80% of the solution, 20% is just treatment.\n\nBy this point my teeth are white, no plaque, tongue is pink, no gum issues, tonsils are gone, so does the wisdom teeth, so there is no doubt in my mind that something is malfunctioning in my gut.\n\nI started testing myself for all sorts of Gut issues, Candida, H.Pylori, Zonulin, Gluten Intolerance, Immune response etc... and fixing them one by one. That's how i got cured!\n\n**What did i test for?**\n\nOnce i started testing myself i realized i have a couple of gut issues, but the only symptom i had was bloating after a meal so i never bothered with going to the doctor for that. I tested positive for H.Pylori despite me resolving it previously, High Zonlulin, mild Gluten Intolerance and my SigA levels were high, that means i have inflammation and leaky gut(i will be posting proof for everything below).\n\n[photo-5958805049599704689-y.jpg](https://postimg.cc/SYKzydKZ)\n\n[photo-5951967921225975198-x.jpg](https://postimg.cc/MX5q8xVK)\n\nAfter 6 months of following a treatment, everything was resolved except for my Zonulin levels which lowered but still not at the range i wanted it to be.\n\n[photo-5890878793193733905-y.jpg](https://postimg.cc/2qj8W64J)\n\nThen i took the Genova GI Map in May 2024, this is where things got interesting, the result showed me i had 2 infections, few overgrowths of bacteria and Dysbiosis, one top of that my SigA levels are now too low(they were too high just 6 months ago).\n\nGenova GI Map Result below\n\n[https://postimg.cc/H8MJtpff](https://postimg.cc/H8MJtpff)  \n[https://postimg.cc/217ZJSVY](https://postimg.cc/217ZJSVY)  \n[https://postimg.cc/BXxLLn5F](https://postimg.cc/BXxLLn5F)  \n[https://postimg.cc/0rKJvfbc](https://postimg.cc/0rKJvfbc)  \n[https://postimg.cc/njC9CKTV](https://postimg.cc/njC9CKTV)\n\nI dug into the report and realized there are 4 possible bacteria overgrowth/infections that cause bad breath or produce bad odour, those were\n\n* ***Klebsiella spp. (4.52e5 vs normal of <5.00e3)***\n* ***Citrobacter freundii (1.54e8 vs normal of <5.00e5)***\n* ***Methanobacteriaceae (4.23e8 vs normal of <3.38e8)***\n* ***C diff. (Toxin A was 5.40e5 vs normal of 1.00e3 and Toxin B was 5.14e5 vs normal of 1.00e3)***\n\n**What was the cure?**\n\nThe lab report came with a treatment plan, i was recommended Oregano, Allicin & Berberine for Klebsiella spp., Coenzym q10 for Citrobacter freundii, Ther-Biotic complete(probiotic) & Acacia fiber powder for Methanobacteriaceae & C diff, on top of these, Alpha lipolic acid, Multi complex( Multi vitamin +mineral) High dose Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Vitamin D were recommended to fix my immune respone (SigA levels).\n\nAt this time i've also fixed my diet and have been going to the gym 5 days per week so my daily capsules + diet routine was on point.\n\n**Proof i got cured?**\n\nI followed this treatment for 4 weeks, took a break for 2 weeks and got a retest, this time from another provider since Genova is a bit expensive, from another provider, unfortunately they messed up the sample during processing so they asked me to send another one, but after the 2 week break i already restarted the probiotic treatment again so that means i had to wait another 3 weeks to take the sample.\n\nStart of May i took the Genova test -> end of May got the result -> June took the treatment -> 2 week break -> mid of July took the 2nd test -> they made a mistake with my sample, sent me a free package -> 3 week break -> mid of August retook 2nd test -> got my result yesterday & lo and behold i'm so happy to share the result.\n\nResult  \n[https://postimg.cc/gallery/GDxCxBS](https://postimg.cc/gallery/GDxCxBS)\n\nAs you can see in the result, 3 out of the 4(with exception of ***Methanobacteriaceae***) are gone, the test doesn't check for Methanobacteriaceae, with those 3 fixed my bad breath is gone, i haven't had a single reaction for the past 8 weeks or so, I didn't want to declare a cure before seeing the numbers and having an idea of exactly what got eliminated inturn knowing what caused it.\n\nI've been having small talks and chit chats with my coworkers and not a single pinch or reaction from anyone, dealing with cashiers, sitting next to people on the tram, all the scenarios that used to get me the reaction no longer do.\n\nAnother thing is my halitosis would get worse as my stomach empties, now even before having lunch i talk with my coworkers face to face and they don't react a bit, that's how i know i've eliminated the issue to it's core, no matter what improvements i used to get from other things i tried, i always knew me with empty stomach always results in an aweful reactions, not anymore.\n\n**What about relapse?**\n\nIt's been 2 months since i hadn't had a reaction and even if it comes back now i know what to do, just test, take treatment, confirmation with another test.\n\n[Also go dig through this forum](https://www.badbreathhalitosis.com/), your problem might've been already discussed years ago, when i searched all these 3 bacterias they were already discussed and solved years ago, [look at this guy who cured his halitosis by eliminating C. diff](https://www.badbreathhalitosis.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=64614#p64614) just like i did now.\n\n***#Rant***\n\nThere were times where i thought this humbling problem can't be fixed, you might be at my place right now but know it's only a matter of time before all of you get cured([this lady cured her 49 year halitosis](https://www.badbreathhalitosis.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=71084#p71084)), just stay strong and be methodical in your approach, try to remove the emotions when trying to solve this, one of the big things that helped me is isolating for a couple of days to recharge my willpower and go back out again. I should've been experiencing so many things in my 20s instead i spent it fighting my dragon breath.\n\n***SO PLEASE JUST STOP TAKING SUPPLEMENTS WITHOUT TESTING AND TRYING TO MASK THE PROBLEM, GO TEST, FOLLOW THE TREATMENT, RETEST AGAIN, THIS METHOD WILL ALSO GIVE YOU A PIECE OF MIND, KNOWING YOU ELIMINATED THE PROBLEM INSTEAD OF THE SYMPTOM.***\n\n**TLDR:** I had ***Klebsiella spp.***, ***Citrobacter freundii***, ***C diff.*** infections/overgrowth and took 4 week herbal antibiotic & probiotic treatment. I urge you to get serious and start testing instead of waiting for the magic supplement or buying every product that gets mentioned in these forums. I spent 9 years trying supplements with nothing to show for it. I ended up solving my issue not even a year into following a strict \"test -> treat -> test\" method.\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT:** Since user u/Difficult_Count2174 is suggesting i'm promoting a brand, i've removed all mentions of it.\n\n**EDIT #2:** Since a lot of people are dming me asking for the products I used I will post it here but know that this is exactly what I said is a mistake I made for 9 years straight, just buying pills and shooting in the dark, test yourself , follow what the lab says as I wrote down in the comments below, the Genova  lab report will give you the exact dose and brand of supplement you need to take.\n\nNote: the lab didn’t recommend me dosage and brand for oregano, allicin, berberine, vitamin d, acacia fiber powder and gelatine. Some of them I already had and some I bought the brands I trusted.\n\n\nADP - Oregano 50mg ( 2 x 2 )\n\nAllimed - Allicin 450mg ( 1 x 2 )\n\nSunday - Berberine 500mg ( 2 x 3 )\n\nSunday - Vitamin D 20,000 IU ( 1 x 1 )\n\nVitortho - Vitamin A 4000 IE ( 1 x 1 )\n\nKlair Lab - Vitamin C 1000 mg ( 1 x 1 )\n\nSoriaBel - Coenzyme Q10 100mg ( 1 x 1 )\n\nKlair Labs - Ther-Biotic complete ( 1 x 1 )\n\nAcacia Fiber Powder ( 5g x 1 )\n\nGelatin Powder ( 5g x 1 )\n\nVeraSupplements Kopervrije Multi voor Volwassenen ( 1 x 1 )\n\nNow Foods - Saccharomyces Boulardii 500 mg ( 1 x 1 )\n\nKlair Labs - Alpha Lipolic Acid 300mg ( 1 x 1 )\n\nI was recommended to take it for 4 weeks and 2 weeks break, then test, if cured yay if not, continue with another 4 weeks and 2 weeks break, repeat.",

I often wondered if that could be the culprit for me even though it was cleared up and almost 10 years ago.. Idk how long I might of had bb but I know late 2016/2017 is when I started seeing ppl around me cover their noses and not wanting to sit next to me. Around that same time I started having sinus issues and frequent infections. I followed all protocols for that (nasal rinsing, antibiotics, etc.) Ultimately I had sinus surgery in 2019. I have been sinus infection free from 2021 up until June of this year. After I got sick on vacation my sinus issues suddenly came back out of nowhere. Besides that I feel like over the years my breath has gotten progressively worse. I, like you, have tried nearly everything and saw all types of specialists and had tests ran that were all normal. From 2017 to present have not missed any dental cleanings or check ups. My ear nose and throat doctor last year said everything still looked good and I actually stopped nasal rinsing in 2022 so I knew my sinuses weren't an issue anymore (up until this summer). I may have silent reflux but I also deal with alot of bloating and infrequent pooping. I'm gonna take your advice and stop trying all these different pills and remedies. It's a waste of time and money on something temporary. I even recently simplified my oral care regimen. Just gargle warm water, floss, brush teeth and brush tongue. All of the extra stuff I was doing that took 15+ minutes didn't make 1 difference so I said I'm not doing all of that just to still get rude remarks and dirty looks. Thanks for this info and I'm happy you have cured your issues!!",

That definitely includes something like rose water so make sure your hair and scalp are thoroughly moisturized before you start, and if needed only spray near the scalp going forward. \n\nAnother FYI, you must make sure the braid or whatever is dry through to the core before undoing it otherwise the curl won't last. \n\nFor me I prefer a good bantu knot out personally. Bantu knots are a cute day one style, the corkscrew curl the original take down brings is another style, and then fully fluffing it out is a 3rd voluminous curl style.",

Pipe cleaners/flexi rods can really help. \n• Two(or even three) strand twists your hair but moisture prior too is key. \n\n• You can hydrate and oil before the twisting process.\nBut when you began feelin the “itchy crazy scalp” feeling then you should get an oil dropper, spring water, then use the dropper to get water into some places. Apply oil after. I do this and my curls last about 11 days. \n\nBut I also am spraying my hair directly with my misting bottle (3-4 sprays, then immediately allow my hair to get sunlight.) \n due to me being a smoker and It released the scent, if I don’t have my hair out in the shower.",

    "body": "\n1.be patient with yourself and hang in there-this is not an easy obstacle to overcome and it takes a toll. Take the proper time you need to regain your health and focus on healing.(I personally had to request time off of work and even went on short term disability.) \n\n2.Find a doctor that does not disregard your feelings/symptoms. I hate to push holistic medicine but I did not get the necessary help I needed until I found a holistic doctor I trusted and he knew his stuff when it came to HIT and other health conditions involving the gut. All other drs before literally were prescribing me anti anxiety meds and telling me I had fibromyalgia. \n\n3.Diet!!! This is huge. Because without this step, you will be in constant turmoil. Start a low histamine, lectin, low oxolate diet and STICK TO IT. Train your mind that you do not need other foods off these lists for a good 4 months minimum while you lower your histamine bucket and then as you stop reacting to foods you can place your focus elsewhere. (Please note and see comment below regarding slowly reducing oxolates from diet as a cold turkey approach on low oxolates can cause intense symptoms)\n\n4.Supplements!!! Another HUGE step. Do your research, consult your holistic doctor(many general doctors are more familiar with medications/prescriptions than supplements((a damn shame)). I personally started with DAO right off the bat. It’s important to research every supplement you plan to take beforehand as many can cause histamine release w/o knowledge. I always split capsules/pills for the first time that I try anything. My current supplements are: DAO, Enterovite, adaptogen-R3, Methyl-Sp, Betaine HCL, Digestive enzyme, probiotic that is approved to help histamine intolerance(from seeking health), ox bil, hepato synergy, calcium D glucarate, pregnenalone and progesterone(during cycle only). \n\n5.I cannot stress this enough- FIND THE ROOT CAUSE. I really urge you not to rely on bandaids aka antihistamines and H2 blockers or steroids. If your reactions are really bad then OF COURSE use whatever means necessary to help you in a bad situation. But in the long haul I personally noticed that these bandaids were contributing to my intolerance rather than helping. I realized the diet alone was not helping and I was reacting to everything in this world so I decided to do my own research with my holistic doctor by my side and we found a bacterial infection known as h pylori, I had SIBO, low HCL, adrenal fatigue, sluggish gallbladder/liver, oestrogen dominance. Now that I am supplementing these finds with proper vitamins/ nutrients I have found the biggest difference. We are not back to 100% normal but I am finally able to wear makeup again, and go weeks without any issues. Finding the root cause can work so much quicker and be an easier fix than the bandaid method that can just string things along long term.\n\n6.although this step may not be huge for everyone… it was for me. FASTING. I found that before I met with my holistic doctor I was eating constantly… like literally snacking all day and not giving my mmc or motility a break. I never realized that shitting once a day was necessary and I never realized that I was not fulfilling that necessity. My detoxification process was shot and we linked this to slow motility from eating constantly and not allowing my mmc to make its sweep between meals. I tried fasting for 16 hours for 1 night after my very first consult with my holistic doctor and when I say I was starving… I mean it… but when I say this was the first time in months that I didn’t swell for 12 hours straight… I also mean that. Slowly my gut digestion is progressing and my bowel movements(tmi sorry) are everyday and this is a huge improvement and I know it has contributed to my progress. Make sure you research the proper ways to fast. I use the 16/8 method where I fast for 16 hours from 6pm-10am then I eat 2 meals within an 8 hour timeframe. If you literally research the benefits of fasting you will be mindblown(I know I was). I wish I had it in my to do a 72 hour fast to reset my stem cells but I think I would personally drop dead. But it is on my bucket list however you do need proper supervision!!!\n\n\nI am only sharing this information because I really wish I knew all of this right from the start when I was struggling so bad that I wanted to admit myself to a psych ward. Not even joking. \nI know these steps may not be for everyone… but if it helps anyone at all even one person then I will be satisfied with just that. \n\nMy low histamine diet:\nBreakfast- bowl of gluten free oatmeal mixed with water and a tbsp of chia seeds, butternut squash diced and plopped into the air fryer(lightly salted), cauliflower rice, coconut blueberry gluten free pancakes(I use literally coconut milk, coconut flour, and blueberries that I purée myself.), pistachios, and a couple spoonfuls of homemade tigernut butter with toasted tigernut flower and coconut oil. I drink aloe Vera juice with each meal. \nDinner- cauliflower crusted gluten free chicken(about 5 pieces-these are frozen prepackaged but organic and very clean), diced squash in the air fryer once more, bok choy, that same coconut blueberry pancake, the same tigernut butter, pistachios.\n\nEdit(months later): my diet has changed a bit. Breakfast: bowl of gluten free oatmeal with chia seeds and water, a cup or more of quinoa with sea salt, and a low histamine muffin made from coconut flour, chia seeds as eggs and coconut milk. Dinner: same chicken as listed before, broccoli, large amount of quinoa. Twice a day I have a shake that has coconut milk, pumpkin seed protein powder(2scoops) and a handful of frozen kale(for fresheners). \n\nI am doing much better and can tolerate oxolates again. I will update my diet once more. \n\nEverything I have done was incredibly successful for me, I was thinking about recording a YouTube video to share my story and the recipes mentioned above. Lmk if that would help.",

Lowering oxalates too quickly can be harmful as dumping causes oxalate to leave the tissue. For some this may not be a problem, but for those on a VERY high ox diet, dumping can bring really intense symptoms. The health pros that work on this issue all recommend a slow reduction.",

    "body": "Hi! I tried these three online prescription services over the past two years and thought a comparison review might be helpful. \n\nMy skin: dry, extra sensitive, eczema prone \n\nConcerns I wanted to address: redness, slight texture\n\n[Packaging of all three (pumps) ](https://imgur.com/a/tZZx3vP)\n\n**Rory**\n\nCost: $5 trial, then $75 per quarter (for my specific formula) \n\nPrescriptions: first 10% azelaic acid, 2% tranexamic acid, 1% magnesium ascorbyl phosphate. Second 0.015% tretinoin, niacinamide 2.5% \n\nFormulation: this formulation also includes ceramides, which I really liked for my dry skin. It was the creamiest and thickest out of all three brands. However, it also had gritty bits in it that made it less enjoyable and more irritating to apply. \n\nResults: Slight redness reduction after 4 months of using every other night \n\nPersonal Opinion: I felt the entire experience was very generic and that my provider was not personalizing my formulas. After experiencing irritation with azaleic acid, they switched me to tretinoin, which did not make sense to me. I did not purchase or try my second formula with the tretinoin.  \n\n**Curology** \n\nCost: $5 trial, then $19 + shipping every month or $40 with free shipping every two months \n\nPrescription: 4% azelaic acid, 4% niacinamide, 0.25% zinc pyrithione \n\nFormulation: this formulation was the smoothest and felt most like a normal moisturizer to apply. Mine had no scent and layered well with the products I used underneath it. It caused no irritation. \n\nResults: Significant redness and texture improvement after 3 months of nightly use \n\nPersonal Opinion: My Curology provider was the most responsive and informative of the three. Curology is known for their low-strength formulas, so I wasn’t surprised that this was the mildest of my prescriptions. My provider has been clear that I can increase strength when I feel ready, though. For now, I appreciate that this causes no sensitivity, and I don’t feel like my skin concerns need anything stronger. Also, the zinc pyrithione in this one really helped flakiness around my eyes and mouth. I usually use a zinc pyrithione cleanser, so it was nice to be able to skip that step with this. \n\n**Apostrophe**\n\nCost: $90 without auto refill, $75 with auto refill every three months \n\nPrescription: 15% azelaic acid, 4% niacinamide \n\nFormulation: This was the thinnest of the creams. It disappeared almost immediately after spreading it on my face. It also had gritty pieces similar to Rory, but these ones were much finer. \n\nResults: Unable to tell because it was too irritating to use more than twice a week \n\nPersonal Opinion: The 15% azelaic was too strong for me to start out with. When I asked my provider if I could have something milder or a different ingredient, they replied that I should just use an over the counter azelaic acid. I did not appreciate this, because I have tried the over the counter products and do not like the consistency or the other ingredients they contain. Apostrophe was by far the least helpful and least informative of the three. \n\n**Overall favorite: Curology** \n\nCurious to hear others’ experiences!\n\nEdit: i also forgot to mention these all use the same base formula containing: \n\naloe barbadensis leaf juice, C13-14 isoparaffin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, water, laureth-7, maltodextrin, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, tocopheryl acetate, triethylene glycol",

The Curology provider was way more informative and each response seemed more personal than Apostrophe. However, the Curology provider only prescribed me 0.035% to start off and using it every night made me peel like crazy when fall/winter hit. It might have been a combination of the formulation and weather change, but my skin didn’t peel this badly at all with Apostrophe. Curology just bumped me up to 0.05% this month.

    "body": "**I hate buying sunscreen.** Outside of a few gel-like sunscreens which I can never find for a reasonable cost, most just disappoint me. I feel like I often have to choose between having the complexion of a sad day, or looking **so** greasy.\n\nMy skin ranges from light-medium to medium-dark. To visualize: I'm Doja Cat when it's cold out and Kerry Washington once I can get some sun - strong golden tones. I tan fast, with or without SPF (though I am very pro-SPF), and have burned exactly once in my entire lifetime. I'm still not interested in putting myself at risk for skin cancer.\n\nI'm not going to claim that this sunscreen will not leave a white cast on people with deeper and darker skin-tones than my own, though I truly hope it works for you. So... here's my review!\n\n**Banana Boat: Light as Air, 50+ SPF UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion**\n\n* **Price**: $5.99 on sale at Kroger, regularly $10.99 here.\n* **Size**: 6 oz. ($0.99/oz. on sale, regularly $1.83/oz.)\n* **Scented**? Yes, it's pretty noticeable at first but fades (not completely). I'm VERY sensitive to scents (I can't wear perfumes, they trigger migraines), but it's not the usual *Eau de Banana Boat* I expected.\n* **White cast?** None on my skin tone. Absolutely none. It's decently liquid-y for the SPF, and if you apply it more liberally, it can be rubbed in and absorbs fairly quickly.\n* **Greasy**? NOPE. It's not one of those slick sunscreens. Alcohol is the fifth sunscreen, and I'm no scientist, but I suspect this may contribute to it.\n* **Pilling**? None. I tried applying more and more to dare it to pill, it didn't! Usually, sunscreen will build up and 'highlight' my hair follicles/stubble (I have hairy arms and can't be bothered to shave regularly) - didn't happen!\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Diisopropyl Adipate, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tapioca Starch, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Coco-Glucoside, Chlorphenesin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.\n\nI read a lot of reviews on here and think \"Yeah, can't relate!\" since a lot of sunscreens with 50+ SPF have white casts, and many AB sunscreens are either intentionally white cast-y or, worse, pink-tinted, which are both a no for me. \n\nI hope this block of text helps another medium-skinned beaut who has been walking around intermittently looking like a tombstone and/or bacon grease. Feel free to ask any questions, I haven't seen much about this sunscreen before, and I've been trying it out for a while now :).",

I myself am white but obviously not enough because the white cast looks horrible, especially if I haven't shaved. And the tinted sunscreens are great, but then their too dark and it can make for some uncomfortable looks out in public. Plus, they cost more per ounce and require more care in application. But then most chemical sunscreens aren't as safe for sensitive, acne prone skin like myself. Several of the supposedly sensitive ones I saw today at Target still had oxybenzone and other irritating ingredients. But this one didn't. So yeah-thanks for the heads up. I'm hopeful about it now!",

I had to test the products adequately before making my mind about them. Other than the products in the picture, I purchased the Milk Protein Shampoo Bar as well. Overall I am very angry at myself for trying these products out.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **0.5% FERULIC ACID, 15% VITAMIN C, 1% VITAMIN E MULTIVITAMIN AGE DEFENSE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C, Alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, D Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate)\n\n***My experience:***  This is the product I was the most excited about. Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum. It was clear when it arrived but has turned slightly yellow now.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Took a picture of the vitamin C serum. It turned slightly yellow now. It was clear when it arrived.](https://preview.redd.it/a5ikili8bjg51.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd81bcb46e515122c37d2f0c79d1440712e1a2f0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **COPPER TRIPEPTIDE + PHYTO CERAMIDE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phospholipids (and Sphingolipids, Copper tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.))\n\n***My experience:*** I wanted to include copper-peptides in my routine after Gothamista raved about them. I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type.

It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

Also if one batches PH went wrong I hope they weren’t being cheap and informed the other people who purchased from that batch and refunded them.

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality as mandelic acid worked great for me personally. I find the texture of it better than TO as it’s gel based. Even phytogel is working ok I probably won’t repurchase that though as it’s works just as aloe gel for me nothing extraordinary however that too has a nice texture. After my experience with them, I do feel that some of their products may need more testing and I would probably steer clear of their copper peptide and retinol and vit c and as a brand they definitely do need work on their customer service but their products can be hit and miss both as with all brands. And so I don’t want to bother myself with the depth of it all as this is just regular beauty industry and nothing new.

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point.

I accidentally bought their face wash instead of replacing my scrub, and haven't tried it as yet. Hoping it'll be as good as the scrub is - think it really helped my break outs. Will definitely try the lotion! \n\nI only tend to by No 7 stuff when they do their vouchers, or when it's in the sale, so might hold out until then!",

    "body": "As the title suggests, this is my current sunscreen collection, and I'll be reviewing the products and mentioning the ones I love and the ones I don't ! (This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

Though reapplication is a miss on the side of cosmetic elegance since it piles up but I am a monkey and I rock it anyway.   \n\n\nYou could maybe layer it up with a bomb gel moisturizer which isn't really thick in body but nourishing and hydrating. So, that it could buffer the stinging sensation?

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nI wanted to share my experience with Gastritis with the hope that it may help those perhaps struggling at the beginning of their journey or even for long time time sufferers who may find value in this post. I know how debilitating this illness can be, but don’t loose hope. \n\nTo cut a long story short, my journey started In February of this year. I was diagnosed with Chronic Gastritis, caused by over use of NSAIDs. Main symptoms were intense nausea that was worse in the mornings, occasional vomiting, pain in lower left abdomen below ribs, bloating, gas and what felt like a blow torch in my stomach. I lost over a stone in weight and had very low energy levels. Fast forward to today and after a lot of trial and error, my stomach is healing to the point where I can now stomach 90% of foods I would have eaten before this began. This is how I got to where I am now.. \n\nI’ll preface this by saying I am not a doctor, and you should discuss your individual circumstance with your GP :) \n\nMedication\n\nI was prescribed a PPI (Omeprazole). For the first few weeks, I took 40mg a day. First dose in the morning, 20 minutes before breakfast. Second dose was before bed. I am now on just the 20mg a day before breakfast. This did seem to help me, but it doesn’t for everyone which is why it is important to talk to your doctor. I plan to continue Like this until the end of the year, after which I will taper off the PPI. I also take gaviscon before bed if Im having a bad day. \n\nSupplements \n\nThere is a lot of scientific and anecdotal evidence that these supplements help heal the stomach lining. Again, before taking anything, discuss with your doctor first.\n\nZinc Carsonine - I ordered Doctors Best Pepzin GI. Zinc Carsonine is used in Japan as a treatment to heal Stomach Ulcers and Gastritis. Honestly my symptoms improved after a week or so of taking this. I take two capsules in the morning on an empty stomach, usually with my PPI medication. \n\nSlippery Elm - I’m from the UK, so I got this from Holland and Barrett but it seems to be readily available from most health stores. It’s really good for soothing and coating the stomach lining and oesophagus. I take 2 capsules, 3 times a day and mix the powder into camomile tea. \n\ndeglycyrrhizinated licorice, or DGL - Again, I got this from Holland and Barrett but it seems readily available. It has anti inflammatory properties and helps coat the ulcer or wound.\n\nProbiotic- Just a good idea to take a probiotic and ensure you have good bacteria In your gut to help digest the food.\n\nThese were the main ones I used, however others have found success using L-Glutamine and Aloe Vera juice. Definitely look into these if you haven’t ready. \n\nExercise \n\nI think it’s important to try and do some physical activity more for your mental state than anything else. Reducing stress and anxiety is key to kicking this as it will make it worse. I found anything too intense would give me a flair up though.\n\nFood \n\nI think Diet will ultimately define your success with healing. The mindset you should have is your stomach has an open sore and needs to heal. Think of an open wound on your arm. Would you rub salt in the wound? (Pun intended!) or alcohol? It would burn like a Mofo right?! \n\nWhilst acid can irritate the gastritis, acid is important in being able to break down the food you eat. It is important not to over eat. This will produce more acid and ultimately cause discomfort. Do try to keep something in your stomach at all times so that the acid has something to work on. Little an often! \n\nI would advise stripping back to basics and go from there. .ie. remove alcohol, sugars, caffeine, dairy, fatty, salty, oily and spicy foods. My diet for the first 2 months or so consisted of plain toast and a banana for breakfast, boiled chicken breast and rice for lunch and dinner, usually with white cabbage, asparagus or green beans. Mid morning and mid afternoon snacks were water biscuits or plain crackers. Camomile tea was and still is a lifesaver. I mix my slippery elm into camomile tea, 3 times a day. It’s really soothing on the stomach.\n\nI found after 4 weeks of this my symptoms had improved and I felt 70% better. I continued like this for another month. By this point, I was able to start reintroducing foods again. I started with adding eggs and porridge with oat milk for breakfast and green leafy salads for lunch. It will take some trial and error to figure out which foods irritate your stomach (avocado was one for me but works for others). \n\nI would say I am now 90% improved. I even managed chocolate and a cup of tea over the weekend without an adverse reaction. Not quite ready for pizza and beer but I can dream :) I know a lot of this probably won’t be new to a lot of people but I hope it might at help someone. If anyone has any questions feel free to message me :) \n\nPeace",

PPI's are not so we can eat whatever we wish. For example, I'm on a double dose and there are lots of foods I cannot tolerate until I'm further along in my healing.

I would say diet is key and figuring out your triggers, which I know is not easy. Moderation as well. For example, I only have an alcoholic drink once a month and it's a small one. What I think really helped my was L-Carnosine. I ended up taking Swansons Brand, 20min before 2 meals a day. I did this for 8 weeks and saw a huge improvement. You have to be patient with this supplement. My GI doctor was very familiar with it and said if it works, great, just don't take it twice a day after 8 weeks, use sparingly after. So now I only take it once or twice a week for maintenance. Now I also take \"gut assist\" for maintenance as well, every other day, and collagen every other day. These are supplements to help with the lining of your stomach and the mucus surrounding it. Do I get acid reflux? Occasionally, but nothing like before with pain. This happens when I don't eat slowly, eat too much or eat something new that then becomes a new trigger (like Brussel sprouts I just recently discovered). Time and patience is going to be your biggest thing here.",

        "body": "I can review them. I have used venusia max in the past, currently using max rich and hymos. \n\nMax rich and venusia max are very similar in terms of consistency and texture. They have a thick cream like texture. It's very moisturising, it takes a few minutes to sink into the skin. I apply these on damp skin immediately after applying the SNP prep serum. It does a good job of locking in the moisture, it leaves my face dewy in the morning. I only use this in the night as they are quite heavy. They are big tubes so they last a long time. I would recommend it to the dry skin peeps. \n\nHymos lotion : the texture is creamy, but it sinks in quickly and leaves a cooling effect on the skin. My skin feels smooth after applying this and it looks matte, it doesn't make it oily. It has 10% aloe vera + 1% Shea butter. I use it as a daytime moisturiser and it doesn't feel heavy, even though I apply it in 30° weather. The quantity is quite a lot so it lasts for a few months. I'll definitely repurchase.",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

It seems like her doctor's don't know much about the disease at all, nor did they give us anything much beyond the diagnosis. We have been navigating this on our own and we are feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Her flare-ups are brutal to watch and they are becoming more frequent. Each flare-up takes her down for at least five days. Her fatigue and exhaustion make it hard for her to stay awake at work sometimes. Her pain is terrible and they just keep throwing more medication at her. I am hoping for some tips tricks suggestions. I would be so grateful for any help you folks can give. I'm talking Sjogrens for dummies here. We know very little about this. Thanks 😊",

A good rheumatologist can work wonders. It's also very common for someone to have multiple autoimmune diseases, and if one isn't being treated she won't feel her best. \n\nIt's also important to figure out what type of pain she's experiencing because the meds work in different ways. For example I take Nabumetone for my rheumatoid arthritis. It only works for pain caused by inflammation/flare ups, so if it doesn't work I know there's something else going on. Having those conversations with an experienced doctor helps a lot.\n\nAlso, a log. Log pain levels, fatigue levels, moods, where the pain is at, and possible triggers like food, weather, hours of sleep, lots of exertion, etc. These can help you find patterns. For me, if I eat too much junk food, my inflammation gets worse. \n\nI still recommend creating your own post, because I'm the only one who is going to see this one.",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "I see a lot of posts on here about sleep and I wanted to share with y’all some of the things I did to cure my chronic insomnia. For backstory, I suffered from CHRONIC insomnia for many years. It would take me 5 hours to fall asleep, I would wake up every hour and I was lucky if I got 5 hours of sleep. I tried every supplement under the sun and nothing worked. A few years ago I decided enough was enough and dedicated my life to fixing the problem. \n\nHere is what I did. \n\nFirstly, it’s important to note that the vast majority of insomnia cases are psychological. Yes, imbalances play a role and it’s important to address those but before you start experimenting with supplements you need to make sure you’re going into this journey with the right mindset. If you take a melatonin tab, and then sit around thinking “I hope this works” all night - it’s probably not going to work. You need to stop thinking about the problem. Try to get yourself into the mindset “well, i may not sleep tonight and who cares”.  Relinquish the control the insomnia has over you. The more you focus on whether you are or aren’t doing sleep, the more you are going to struggle. \n\nOnce I got over caring, I took a multi dimension approach to the problem. \n\n1. I stopped drinking entirely. If you drink alcohol whatsoever, it’s going to affect your sleep. It took me a few months off alcohol to start to notice an improvement. \n2. Don’t eat or drink liquids after 7PM. \n3. I do 5 minutes of red light therapy upon waking up, and 5 minutes when the sun goes down for my Circadian Rhythm.\n4. After the evening red light, put on a pair of yellow tinted blue light glasses. \n5. Commit to an evening routine and stick to it - no exceptions. Give yourself two hours of quiet,\nunwinding time before bed and be in bed by 9:30-10 every single night. Dont watch anything too engaging on TV. \n6. Make your room pitch black and cold and wear an eye mask if you need to. If you have a partner that snores or disrupts you, sleep in a different room.\n7. This is important. Make sure you are eating an incredibly nutritious, mineral dense diet. Eat a variety of organic proteins, vegetables, fruits and get off all the junk. No exceptions. No supplement is going to fix a body that’s being deprived of basic nutrients. \n8. LOWER YOUR STESS. Do everything you can absolutely do to lower your daily stress. Breathwork, warm baths, sauna, herbs etc. Address the toxic relationships in your life and get a new job if it’s ruining your life. None of these things are worth the toll of sleep deprivation. \n9. Once these things are addressed, now you can look into supplements. I take 250mg of Pure Encapsulation Magnesium Glycinate every night, drink a cup of aloe Vera juice after dinner (high in potassium) and take Cymbiotika Liposomal Sleep supplement. I also had a good experience with the CALM brand Magnesium sleep formula. It’s tempting to want to take a whole slew of supplements, but all that does is overwhelm the body and actually make your wake up more. Keep the supplements simple. \n\n\nHere are my supplements:\n\nhttps://cymbiotika.com/products/sleep?srsltid=AfmBOoojM2OcPR5k-LPh_Vgm79-GfDEx3u8BpBtFG1YNRCWFYdod2qaC\n\nhttps://a.co/d/9yu1IqI\n\nhttps://a.co/d/blIBKDg\n\n\nAfter incorporating all of these things into my life, my sleep scores are now consistently in the 90s. I also want to note that just implementing one or two of these probably won’t do much. I stand by the fact that 1-8 should be non negotiable for anyone suffering with insomnia. \n\nHope you all have a great day!\n\n",

If you know how, you do 5 or 10 minutes of meditation to clear your mind and turn your brain off, if anything just sit for 5 minutes and focus on your breath only; any time your mind wanders, notice that and bring it back to your breath.

    "body": "So, I just recently bought into the whole AB shebang. I did my research and came up with a routine, and have been using a blend of mostly Korean and Japanese products for just the past two weeks or so. Here's the thing though. I've noticed that the products that are most raved about here and that are considered HG seem to be considered so mainly because of how they help with acne. I feel like 99% of the folks here are acne-prone and acne and scarring are their main problems. I feel like I belong to a very small minority. I am not at all acne prone. Never have been. My main concern is skin aging as I now have fine lines and some sun damage, including discolorations, and overall skin dullness. I also feel like my skin is dehydrated from a recent wrong encounter with tret. Now, my question is, are most of the HG products here at AB at all helpful for fine lines and other aging skin concerns? Every time I look up a review, the people who rave about the product keep saying over and over again that it helped with their acne. I hardly ever hear anyone saying it helped with their fine lines and dullness and just overall helped make their skin better, healthier, plumper, more radiant. Now, I'm not sure if I bought the wrong products. For instance, is snail supposed to provide benefits apart from helping heal acne and acne scars?\n\nFor reference, here is my current routine:\n\n* **First Cleanser:** Pond's Cold Cream (does the job, IMHO, and is so much cheaper than the Korean alternatives)\n* **Second Cleanser:** Mizon Repairing Foam Cleanser (seems okay but high PH, so I'm planning to replace)\n* **Exfoliator:** 1. Skinfood Black Sugar Wash-Off Mask (I found this too rough on my skin and I didn't really see any brightening or smoothening effects. In fact, after using it my skin felt worse than it was and I even got some scratches from the sharp sugar crystals, even after I diluted it with water and waited for it to melt a little before I started scrubbing)\n* 2. Skinfood Rice Wash-Off Mask (This one I absolutely LOVE. It is gentle and soothing, but it does its job when it comes to physically exfoliating. After first use, it just really removed like magic the wrinkly, dull dead skin cells that were sitting on top of my cheeks and forehead, and left me with baby-smooth, radiant skin.)\n* **Actives:** DIY Vitamin C serum (AM), Retin-A .05% 3x a week, buffered for now (PM)\n* **FTE:** Kiku-masamune High Moist (This one I love and seems to really provide a LOT of hydration, and I noticed an immediate difference in my skin just in the first few days of use, heck, even after the very first application.)\n* **Toner:** Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium (I can't really see what this does. Used it before I got the Kiku and couldn't see any hydration at all. It just feels sticky. Am now using it immediately after the Kiku and I still couldn't see any difference in hydration or plumping or anything like that. Really unsure about this one.)\n* **Essence:** Cosrx Advanced 96 Snail Mucin Power Essence (This is one of the items that seem to be raved about by folks who have acne problems and that I am unsure about any benefits for overall wellness for aging skin)\n* **Ampoule:** Scinic Honey AIO (Another one that I am not sure is beneficial for overall skin wellness for aging skin. Even when I use just a tad, it makes my skin so sticky and I don't really see any of the glow that it's supposed to give, nor the hydration. It looks and feels sticky, not glowy. I'm thinking of getting the LJH Vita Propolis as a replacement, but not sure if that one is also only good for the acne prone.)\n* **Light Moisturizer:** Mizon Black Snail AIO (I don't really see this doing anything for me either, but I admit it's probably too soon to tell, since I am only on, I think, my third week. Thinking of replacing with the Benton Steam Cream, but when I looked that up, again, it seems to be HG only because of how it helps heal acne.)\n* **Eye Cream:** MUZ Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream (I don't think anyone here knows about this brand but I LOVE this. It is dirt-cheap but I feel like it has helped with my undereye wrinkles and dark circles and overall moisture more than any other high-end eye creams I've tried. It contains Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Shea Butter, Sodium Hyaluronate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Solluble Collagen, Houttuynia Cordata Extract and is paraben-free and alcohol-free. I really have seen a noticeable difference in the short time I've started using this.)\n* **Moisturizer:** Physiogel Daily Moisture Therapy (Another that is almost never mentioned here but that really makes a very noticeable difference. Hydrating, plumping, skin tone evening, this gives my skin a subtle radiance and an overall healthy look. I don't understand why no one here seems to know about it or like it. I did see one Korean video where they use this and have heard this is popular in Korea as well.)\n* **Sleeping Pack:** Laneige Water Sleeping Pack (I like this a lot, but I'm not sure if it provides any long-lasting benefits. I feel it may just be the silicone component that makes my skin look so hydrated in the morning, and not real hydration. I love how my skin looks in the morning though, but once you wash it off, it's gone.)\n* **Sunscreen:** Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel (better and more hydrating than the Essence, especially the BB in the pink tube, which is horribly drying and looks horrible on aging skin. I'm also using the Nivea Protect & Moisture and it is a lot more moisturizing than the Biore, but sadly the new reformulated PA++++ is not yet available here and this one is only PA++.)\n\nThat's it. I'm really just hoping to hear from the minority group of ABers who are NOT acne prone, and to hear about possible recommendations and replacements, especially for the Cosrx (and all snail products), as well as for the honey and propolis products. \n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for all the helpful responses. As an update, I have recently developed a better appreciation of both the snails and the Scinic Honey. The trick is to wait at least 5 minutes after the hada labo/toner and after the Advanced 96, and to use THREE pumps, not two, of the Advanced 96. Also, slathering all over the face before patting seems to work better for me. Ever since trying the above methods, I feel as though the products absorb better and they seem to provide better glow and hydration to my skin. After three weeks of the routine, I can definitely say that my skin quality has improved. Not yet dramatically, but it has improved. So, for now, I plan to continue using my snails and honey/propolis products and see where it goes. ",

It sounds like you are looking for something that is *specifically* for anti aging in the long run, but you are finding out that your routine is helping you anyway, so all the \"talk\" about snail and honey for acne is off putting.  I firmly believe that those things may also be helping with hydration and plumpiness which contribute to the overall improvement of your skin.  I see them often marketed for anti aging due to this effect. \nI think the only way you can find out if the snail and honey are helping the lines/dark circles is by removing them from the routine and see what happens. If it didn't do anything, then don't repurchase it and try something else. The reason why retinoid acid is so highly touted is because of the long researched results in inducing collagen production in the long run which slows down as we age, and we can't just slap collagen on the face and hope for the best, it doesn't work (retinoid acid also very popular for resolving acne among dermatologists, so it's not an \"either/or\" situation). Things like seaweed and licorice and snail are not researched to this degree though some companies would advertise that their R/D found results, so you have to trial and error.  I read that copper peptide also starts to go amiss when we age, so you can look into that as well.",

As for aging concerns, my concerns are: evening skin tone, eliminating PIH, and preventing wrinkles (I have a laugh line, which gives me thoughts).\n\nI know most reviews discuss acne but this is where you've got to know your science or at least where to look because the only reason you'll have an idea if a product will help with aging is if you do the research (I spent a good 3 hrs yesterday researching products for future purchases to hit on PIH/skintone issues.). Generally, AB skews younger if we take into account this reddit IMO. Some do have aging concerns but in the context of prevention rather than winding the clock back. \n\nIMO, AB offers a great foundation for aging skin. Aging skin: \n\n- losses elasticity (loss of fatty skin), \n- is more dehydrated/ dry, \n- has age spots (UV damage), and \n- wrinkles. \n\nA lot of this can be combated with a routine focused on **hydration and moisture**.  Yes, reviews discuss acne but these same products will likely in some capacity offer hydration and moisture to the skin so they can still be helpful for aging skin. And sunscreen really is non-negotiable. \n\n\nI'm pretty meh about most products you're using but if they work for you, they work for you. I don't use snail because I get hydration from other products in my routine (I find that snail is most useful for soothing, so those who still get acne). I keep moisture through having a med. moisturizer (although I plan on getting an emulsion for summer as I live in a swamp), and an oil, and make sure to use a sleeping pack to protect against waterloss. \n\n\nI have an oil like passionfruit because it supposedly fights free radicals and adds moisture but I'll be repurchasing it because I've seen awesome results in lightening the dark circles around my eyes. I use an FTE because it does brighten my skin overall. I use a BHA because my pores are huge otherwise. And the overall hydration in my routine keeps my skin plump. I'm testing a nonAB retinol right now and added a nonAB arbutin serum (for PIH) to my routine a couple of weeks ago. I notice the difference in my skin when I skip my routine for a few days -- loss of vibrancy in my skin, my laugh line is more prominent, and my skin is not plump. \n\n\n*Future purchases*: Me making a purchase decision is like making a plan of attack. I've adjusted my decision making recently and really only decide on purchasing if I find it'll add value to my skin based on research and a target to what my concerns are. \n\n- I'll add an oil like prickly pear and marula because I've heard so much about their antioxidant power and fatty acid content (I'm pretty much, gimmie all the fats). \n\n- I'm searching for the best Vit C serum and acid peel to attack the discoloration/PIH I have and I'll be re-adding a niacinamide product soon (personally, I don't know if niacinamide does anything for my skin but I'll give it another shot). \n\n- I'll be adding Stratia's liquid gold as well because it's an easily attainable product that I know hits the 3-1-1 ratio needed for actual ceramide penetration of the skin (which I think is important for aging skin). \n\nI'm adding all these things but they are on top of a routine that provides moisture/ hydration for my skin. If I feel like I'm missing something or something isn't performing, I'll add another product. Right now, I'm using HL Albutin moist lotion and I don't think it provides the hydration I need so when I finish it (hopefully in the next week or two) I'll replace it with another hydrating toner.\n\nBut I'm gonna be honest these products will not replace an Rx like tret or any retinoid. So, I view my routine as the accompaniment rather than the star. It'll provide the foundation so my skin can with stand a strong Rx (when I add one). My friend is a derm and really likes that I'm knowledgable about skin and ingredients but is very clear that tret is the best form of defense against aging (and acne) and likes to bring the papers to me, lol.  \n\n**TLDR**: Having an Rx like tret combined with a proper routine of moisture/ hydration, sunscreen protection, and a healthy lifestyle are the best methods to wind back the clock.",

        "body": "> I've noticed that the products that are most raved about here and that are considered HG seem to be considered so mainly because of how they help with acne. I feel like 99% of the folks here are acne-prone and acne and scarring are their main problems.... I now have fine lines and some sun damage, including discolorations, and overall skin dullness.\n\nAcne scarring and sun damage are both forms of hyperpigmentation and so they benefit from the same products. Off the top of my head, I feel like the most raved about products are Benton Snail Bee Essence (for soothing acne or redness), Scinic Honey AIO (for overall brightening), Cosrx AHA and BHA (for a tonne of issues), and Hada Labo/Kikumasamune/Cezanne Lotion (for hydration). I honestly don't think there are that many acne specific products that have literally zero use for anyone without acne. BHA can be a preventative for acne, but it's also good for sebum control and SFs. AHA can help active acne or PIH from acne, but it's also good for cell turnover for brightening including anti-aging concerns like dullness and PIH from sun damage (which tends to be a bigger problem the older you get because you start to see the long-term effects of damage gained years ago). Vitamin C helps pigmentation, whether that's from acne or sun damage. The plethora of hydrating products is good for pretty much everyone, whether they use one or several.\n\nStill, there have been good general recommendations, and hopefully this thread helps those who do feel there aren't products for them.",

There doesn't seem to be many posts from older Redditors. As previous posts have mentioned, the age group of this sub skews much younger. I'm in my 40's and I've used some AB products for years (mostly Shiseido sunscreen and makeup) but didn't make the switch to all-AB skincare until 6 months ago. I was initially using a lot of Mizon products (I'm one of the suckers that way overpaid on products from Peach and Lily!) and, because my skin was so dehydrated, saw a huge improvement. However, the progress plateaued quickly once the dehydration was addressed. I went through a a couple months of buying and using many HG products that are often discussed in the sub, but didn't see much effect. Then I stumbled onto Sulwhasoo products and Vitamin C and I really began to see results. My skin has never felt so soft, been so plump, and many people have remarked that I have the AB glow. There are people on here who dismiss Sulwhasoo products as ineffective. My suspicion is they are probably younger and have skin which does not lack in whatever Sulwhasoo products replace in more mature skin so they don't see any improvement. I haven't quite picked out my HG products because I've been buying samples of their lines on Amazon and eBay (MUCH more cost-effective), but overall I've gotten better results from Sulwhasoo than anything else I've tried.",

        "body": "You completely read my mind, I was wondering about this for the past few weeks when I realized that way more people posting here is pretty young and has acne problems and only very few people talks about anti-aging products. I was planning to ask recommendations from people over 35+ soon.\n\nI have been at AB for only 3 months but I think somehow I avoided buying completely wrong products and even though anti-aging skin care won't show results so fast I will just keep using it as it seems to make my skin nicer. I'm 46 and didn't really think that much about skincare until last winter. I have been using vitamin C, AHA, resist serum and 1% retinol (besides moisturizer) from Paula's choice for the past 3 years but very inconsistently and didn't know about the PH dependent use of acids so not sure how much good what I was using did anyway. I didn't think about my skin being bad and I don't have that much wrinkles except creppines under eyes that is a problem especially when I can't sleep and am in a pain (I have fibromyalgia). But after jumping on AB wagon I started to scrutinize my face and found that my skin is kind of uneven, dull and big pores. Here is what I think are supposedly anti-aging ingredients in products that I use or going to use soon.\n\nRetinol - I didn't realized that retinol is not used as much in AB products until I couldn't find many. I did get AgeVetoLAB retinol night moisturizer that has micro-encapsulated 2.5 % retinol, vitamin C, niacinamide, peptides, HA, vitamin E and green tea. And just started using   couple weeks ago Naruko ampm  A40 pore minimizing complex that is 4% retinol. That one is pretty strong so I use tons of moisture layers before and after. I use that one twice a week. I never used retinol that was more than 1% so this might actually have some effect as the previous PC retinol and retinol booster never made me flake much.\n\nGinseng - Some ginseng products I incorporated are Hanyacho black ginseng bogam toner by Tonymoly and Sooyeran wild ginseng essence by Saem that is very thick, looks almost like honey but spreads well and its not sticky.  Also have sample of Sulwhasoo concentrated ginseng renewing cream EX  that I really like and consider getting more of the sample size because of the cost. \n\nVitamin C - I tried OST 20 but I'm back to western one Timeless with cerulic and vitamin E.  Not sticky at all. Also got Matrixyl 3000 from Timeless that I started to use before Vitamin C just a couple weeks ago, found it while researching more antiwrinkle stuff for my eyes. \n\nAcids - daily using cosrx blackhead power liquid and Mizon Aha 8% peeling serum. Once a week I use Paula's choice Resist 10% weekly treatment and (re)fresh 15%  fruit acid gel peel. Going to try PHA so I have Make P:rem pha serum, booster and night cream on the way, found great deal of all 3 for 58 USD on eBay. Also use Naruko mandelic acid masks. \n\nPropolis - I just finished Scinic propolis 95 ampoule and no I'm going to try Graymelin propolis 80. Nothing wrong with Scinic just want to experiment a bit. I also got the LJH  vita propolis but was shocked when I saw how tiny it is for the price so using only few drops with moisturizing emulsion. \n\nNiacinamid - the strongest I found is Paula's choice  Resist 10% niacinamide booster. You can add it to other stuff or just apply straight. Haven't started it yet as I have a lot of stuff with it right now. I'm using Manyo factory galactomyces niacin essence and Nature republic white vita flora capsule essence that has 5%. Also for brightening and dullness I use Naruko ampm skin immaculate duo that has 7% arbutin, 5% vitamin B3, 3% tranexamic acid. My skin looks brighter but since I'm using more than 1 product for that I can't tell what does what. I guess I will find out when I will stop using specific products.\n\nCeramides -  using dr. Jart  Ceramidin liquid, just finished Dynasty cream which I will repurchase later (have few new creams  mostly moisturizing for warm months waiting their turn), have Skin watchers ceramizing cream ready for next winter, I decided to wait to use till then as it might be heavier. \n\nAntioxidants - green tea I have Innisfree green tea serum about to start and Innisfree green tea sleeping pack that is great for moisturizing. And I really like Tonymoly chok chok green tea watery cream as moisturizer and Tonymoly black tea London classic eye cream. \n\n\nSnail - starting second bottle of Mizon snail repair intensive ampoule, using also alternatively with Benton Snail bee high content essence or lotion, when needed also steam cream. Basically there is always at least one step that contains snail. \n\nGreat for overall anti-aging properties - Freeset donkey milk 3D  moisture cream has NMFs, lipids, licorice and chaga mushroom as powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits and also niacinamide. Only been using for 3 weeks but already got two more backups for great price as I  love it. Also love Innisfree soybean energy cream, feels soft as butter. Soon will start Saem power ampoule anti wrinkle with black yeast ferment. Also got bifida ferment and beta glucan from Graymelin, Zymogen fermented soybean firming serum that has peptides, ferments and ceramide 3 and waiting for Innisfree ginger oil serum. For second eye cream I just added Peter Thomas Roth mega rich intensive anti-aging eye cream that has 4 peptides and ceramide. And two more serums I have been using  and are not AB (and got seconds of) are bareminerals skinlongevity serum and Hey honey, Good morning silk honey serum that also have sea buckthorn oil. I like to use 3-4 different serums at AM and PM so that's why I have so many. Skincare wardrobe all the way. I also use tons of hydrating layers that I'm not gonna mention here as I wanted to keep it mostly to anti-aging stuff that doesn't get mentioned as much.\n\nAgain I have no idea if any of this actually works for anti-aging but better be safe than sorry.

I'm cool with my age generally, but also I find that when my skin is nicely hydrated, many of them plump away anyhow. There are some left, but the pretty silver hairs coming in would be a tip-off on my aging even if there weren't. I still have people shocked at my age since many want to place me in my mid-twenties or younger. \n\nI do feel like I must be in a very small minority that do not use actives! They sound really rough to me and like there is so much potential for things to go wrong. I have nice skin already, don't want to mess it up!",

The peonies are a must. I never buy flowers for myself and I plan on going back to get more before their all gone. The lemony arugula salad kit I can’t recommend enough. It’s my hands down favorite salad kit. Schwarma chicken flatbread was good but had a weird spice in it my husband was not fan of.

    "body": "Been having problems with BV for years… omg, YEARS! I can’t even enjoy sex or have sex like I want to because of this mess. It’s so embarrassing to say the least 🙄\n\nAnyway, I went to my OBGYN last week and of course he prescribed me antibiotics, I took four 500mg for two days. Didn’t work. Discharge came back, smell, etc 😵‍💫. Called back to see if they can get me something else. Then I thought about how tired I am of taking antibiotics! IM SO TIRED‼️ It’s messing up my gut health, I have to take these every month it seems! I’ve been tested for everything, negative. Ureaplasma and mycoplasma- negative. \n\nAnyway, found a healthy alternative because I refuse to take antibiotics this time. Like no, I’m not doing it. I need to get my gut health in check and then after that I’m pretty sure the BV will go away on its own. \n\nSo, I got an aloe Vera plant from 4 seasons. It’s a big one 🤭. Let it soak in a bowl overnight to release the yellow toxins (it contains latex). Cut it up into small chunks, I washed the slimy stuff (some ppl say you don’t have to) but I do, and wrap it in foil that’s safe to freeze or some other wrap, it doesn’t matter. Let it freeze and pushed it up there after showering. Use the inner leaf ONLY. \n\nI’ve been using this for 3 days so far…. The second day, I noticed the smell diminishing… the third day, it diminished  some more. I plan on using it for a week straight to see how it goes, but so far it’s been working really well. It will slide out on its own & if you’re having any irritation down there you can rub it all down there, it won’t hurt. You can use the slime as lubricant for sex. I’ve even used it my hair plenty of times as well. \n\nAnd I also got some aloe vera juice (no sugar added) from Walmart (this one has lemon juice in it and it’s in a glass bottle on the juice isle) and the other from the health food store. I drink like a shot every morning on a empty stomach. It literally has no taste except for the one that has lemon juice. So you wont be gagging while drinking it, I drink it really quick. It’s honestly not bad. It kind of tastes like water to me in a way but I let my sister try it and she says it’s nasty 😅. So depending on your taste buds you might have to dilute it with some juice or something lol. \n\nAlso, when swallowing aloe vera it acts a laxative so don’t get all crazy lol. My stomach is rumbling right now 😂. My son was constipated the other day and I let him drink a shot, he went to use the bathroom about 15 minutes later. So I’m sure that’s why a lot of people say aloe vera is like a detox or gut cleanser. So yea, it definitely works. \n\n& mind you, don’t get the one that says WHOLE LEAF.\n\n\n\n🌺Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk and I hope you guys try it out and see results. If you do, pls come back and let us know if it worked for you🌺\n\nUPDATE: AV worked for about a week, after that it stopped 😒….. but I’ve been trying something else, I’ve been using both of them for about 2 weeks. And it has been surprisingly working well. Like, I’m really surprised! So, one time I was at the obgyn and one of the women that was talking to me in the back told me about vh essentials (probiotics with prebiotics & cranberry) and how it keeps her lady bits in check…. I finally got it, I’ve been taking it twice a day on an empty stomach AND I’ve been consuming raw garlic- smash it with a knife, take the peel off, set a timer to 10-15 minutes so it can release the good stuff(I forget what it’s called). Sometimes I consume it with honey, it kinda makes it taste better… Raw garlic has some antibacterial and anti microbial properties that helps fight off many pathogenic bacteria. I haven’t had sex in like 2 months lol… but I did lastnight and there was no smell 🥹 and I haven’t been on antibiotics in a while so I’m happy about that.\n\nBut I think I will still use the aloe Vera sometimes though, it was very soothing down there.",

It was my first real surgery, the only thing I had done prior was wisdom teeth. I used to work at a surgery center with ENT docs, and I used to be a pharmacy tech so I have all the tips and tricks.\n\n**Supplies I Used**\n\n* Humidifier (if you can't get one, you can run the hot shower or boil a pot of water for a similar effect)\n* Tongue scraper\n* Kid's toothbrush\n* Ice packs (to wrap around the head, you will need it for the ear pain)\n* Dixie cups (used to measure how much water I was drinking, especially at night, super super helpful)\n* Pill crusher (I couldn't stand the liquid tylenol, so I would crush up tablets and mix them in applesauce or pudding. Just make sure not to crush an XR/ER or ODT pill, if you aren't sure check with a pharmacist)\n* Ice cubes or crushed ice\n* Stool softener (colace or docusate sodium, start taking 1x a day for 3 days prior to surgery, take 1x a day for every day you take hard pain meds)\n* Pillows to sleep elevated\n* Mouth tape (prevents mouth breathing which is drying)\n* Hydrogen peroxide (likely won't need this one, but if you have a bleed and can't stop it with ice, this will come in handy. mix 50/50 cold water and hydrogen peroxide and hold in back of your throat)\n* Heated blanket (having all those ice packs on me and eating ice all the time kept me FREEZING I had my heated blanket on 24/7)\n* Insulated water bottle (kept next to my bed filled with ice so I didn't have to go downstairs every time I wanted ice)\n\n**Food/Drinks**\n\n* Pedialyte popsicles (these were good but sometimes they burned, start with one box don't go overboard)\n* Aloe water (alo brand with just aloe and honey was the best but anything works, this will also help with constipation)\n* Prune juice (if you can stand it, will help with constipation)\n* Applesauce (the gogo squeeze brand was wayyy too harsh and burned after day 3, but motts in a cup was bearable)\n* Ensure/Pediasure/Boost (worked great for me up until day 4, then it started to burn so don't buy a fridge full)\n* Cream of Wheat (the only thing that didn't burn after day 4, made it with oat milk and honey)\n* Pudding\n* Mac & Cheese (started eating this on day 6, I found Kraft and Panera to go down easiest)\n\n**Surgery Day**\n\nPrior to Surgery:\n\nThe week before surgery, load up on water!! This will make your anaesthesiologist's job sooo much easier, therefore making YOUR life easier. Drink drink drink, especially the day before. Don't take any vitamin E, advil, or aspirin. If you need pain meds stick to tylenol. Discuss with your doctor about how long to hold off on those, for me it was 2 weeks for aspirin/advil, and 6 weeks for anything containing vitamin E. 3 days prior to surgery, start on the stool softener. Take it 1x a day for 3 days prior to surgery. This will prevent the anesthesia from backing you up (I was able to go the next morning with no issues). If you have any concerns with nausea while on pain meds, tell your surgeon so they can prescribe you zofran or a scopolamine patch.\n\nWhat to Bring/Wear:\n\nWear comfortable clothes that are easy to take on and off (button-downs are easiest), and only bring the bare essentials! If you have long hair, bring a hair tie or scrunchie, just make sure it has no metal. I wore slides, warm crew socks, sweatpants, and a flannel. I wore a bra but you'll need to take it off. I only brought my phone and my wallet. Make sure to take off all jewelry and anything metal before surgery! Better to take it off at home so you don't risk losing it there.\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nIt varies with every place, but I'll share my experience anyway. I had my surgery done at a private surgery center (actually the place I used to work which had its pros and cons lol). I walked in at 6:30am where they took my temp, got checked in, and paid my co-pay (so much money ;-;). They sent me into pre-op at around 6:45, where they gave me a gown and a bag, and told me to change into the gown and put all my belongings in the bag. Once I was changed, they got me some warm blankets and asked me to verify some stuff (my name and DOB, what surgery I was getting, what doc I was seeing, any medical history, etc). They put a hairnet on me and took vitals while this was happening (I was so nervous I was almost in tears and my heart rate was through the roof). Then they put the IV in, which felt pretty much exactly like getting blood drawn (at my place the standard was in the hand but my nurse was like I'll put it up here (inner elbow) so you can use your phone without seeing it which I soooo appreciated, so I recommend asking if you don't want it in your hand, worst they can say is no). Then I sat around for a bit while they set up the OR, and the nurses chatted with me while I waited. Around 7, the anaesthesiologist came over and asked me some questions, and started running the IV. This is the time to mention any nausea concerns! The doc will make sure to give you zofran along with any anesthesia so you're not nauseous when you wake up. The fluids felt kinda cold going up my arm, and then he gave me some versed to relax me (heart rate still going wild). I didn't feel it going in my arm but after he administered it I felt like I had had a couple of drinks, and I felt relaxed. Nothing scary at all. At around 7:10 my surgeon came in and asked if I had any last-minute questions, and then once he left I sat for a bit to get more fluids, and I was off. At 7:20 they put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me into the OR. I got up on the table, and the nurses started hooking me up to monitors. I thought I'd be terrified, but I was super relaxed (probably because of the versed lol). While they were doing this, they put a mask over my face with just oxygen, and then I was out like a light. Next thing I remember was slowly waking up sleeping on my side in the recovery room. Nothing hurt, nothing was bothering me, I just felt *really really tired*. It felt like I had taken a 5 minute nap, and I wasn't ready to get up yet. I knew I was in recovery though, and I asked the nurse if I could sleep for longer or if she wanted me to try to get up now. Luckily she said I could sleep LOL. I woke up at around 9:30, but the surgery only lasted about an hour (in \\~7:30, out \\~8:45) so I slept for a good hour afterward. Once I started to wake up, I got some water and some ice chips, but they were really hard to get down only because I had to pee SO BAD (they pumped 2.5 liters of fluid into me so this was expected). I was alert just a little unsteady on my feet, but I was able to use the bathroom on my own. From then on it was just a waiting game. They needed to monitor me for 2 hours to make sure I was healing okay and not having any bad side effects, so I just used my phone and drank water for another hour while the nurse checked my throat with a flashlight and gave me some healing tips. My mom and my girlfriend were allowed to come in once I was awake, and I could talk just fine, but I was so tired that I didn't really want to. Once 10:45 hit, I was able to go home! They sent my family out to get the car, took out my IV, and gave me my clothes so I could get changed, then they wheeled me out. I was fine in the car, and I was able to walk on my own and I felt normal by the time we got home at 11:30.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nI feel my recovery was very easy compared to some others. There were times when it got hard, especially mentally, but the pain was never my biggest issue. Here's how my recovery went!\n\nThings to note:\n\n* what you can tolerate will change as you recover. don't stock up with 2 weeks' worth of one food, even if it seems to be working.\n* my adenoid holes redirected my airflow for a day so i couldn't breathe out of my nose. don't panic if this happens to you! it'll go away\n* minor bleed story day 8\n* if you have the urge to cough, dont! drink water instead\n* ice pack around the ears helps with the ear pain immensely, i lived in an ice pack head wrap until day 9\n\n**Day 0: pain 1/10 | swallowing 1/10 | discomfort 1.5/10**\n\nwide awake after surgery, spent the day watching tv having pediasure, applesauce, aloe vera juice, and ice water. kept ice on my neck/ears 24/7. just taking tylenol\n\n**Day 1: pain  1/10 | swallowing 3/10 | discomfort 2/10**\n\nnight was rough because i was uncomfortable and anxious. in the morning i felt better once i got up and took a slow walk around my yard. day was ok, I set a timer every 15 minutes to drink 1/2 a dixie cup of water, and at night i had a timer every 90 minutes to drink a full cup. still just taking tylenol.\n\n**Day 2: pain 1/10 | swallowing 4/10 | discomfort 3/10**\n\nnothing eventful happened day 2, stayed pretty much the same as day 1. pain would come and go in waves. still only on tylenol.\n\n**Day 3: pain 2/10 | swallowing 7/10 | discomfort 3/10**\n\npain starting to ramp up but still nothing crazy. nights are rough. pain comes and goes in waves. still only on tylenol.\n\n**Day 4: pain 2/10 | swallowing 8/10 | discomfort 4/10**\n\ntook hydrocodone last night, just to try to get some sleep. my throat is so swollen that I stopped being able to breathe through my nose, but this was odd, i'll explain. I could breathe in just fine, but breathing out felt like the air was being pushed back into my throat unless i breathed out through my mouth. I think the way my adenoid holes had swollen, they were acting as an air deflector and redirecting the air back down my throat. it made it nearly impossible to sleep! this went away after a day. ALSO! foods that had previously worked started to burn like CRAZY, and would burn for an hour after. i had to stop eating applesauce, ensure, and anything that made me feel like i was getting some substance in me. the only thing i could get down without burning like crazy was cream of wheat.\n\n**Day 5: pain 3/10 | swallowing 8/10 | discomfort 4/10**\n\ndays 5-7 pain stayed relatively the same, still coming and going in waves. I only took my hydrocodone night of day 4 and night of day 5 just to sleep, otherwise I was on tylenol. pain stayed relatively the same throughout these days. sometimes it would feel like the world was ending, and sometimes i'd feel nearly normal. this didn't seem to correlate with my pain med regimen which was frustrating.\n\n**Day 6: pain 4/10 | swallowing 8.5/10 | discomfort 4/10**\n\npretty much same as day 5, hydrocodone didn't do anything for pain and i decided it wasn't worth the side effects, so i went back to tylenol at night\n\n**Day 7: pain 4.5/10 | swallowing 8.5/10 | discomfort 4/10**\n\nthis was the worst day. not necessarily because of pain, although it was painful, but not sleeping and not eating had taken such a toll on me mentally. i was just so upset with my situation. i didn't regret it and i knew this would end soon, but i really felt like i couldn't take it anymore. i was crying a lot on this day (hadn't cried before) which made my throat incredibly uncomfortable but mentally i was so unwell.\n\n**Day 8: pain 0.5/10 | swallowing 1/10 | discomfort 0.5/10**\n\nwoke up to a bleed at 5am. my stomach felt off like i had swallowed a lot of blood, and i felt like i was salivating an excessive amount. it didn't taste like blood, but i decided to check anyway because i was paranoid. i let my spit drop into the bathroom sink, and it turns out i was bleeding! i shakily ran downstairs and grabbed a bunch of ice and threw it into a cup. i put ice in my mouth and held it in my throat, and i would spit it out into the kitchen sink once it melted. my girlfriend came downstairs and started blending ice for me, and i alternated with ice water and ice chips for about 20 minutes until it slowed enough (didn't stop though) to call the doctor (instructions were to call doc if any evidence of bright red bleeding). at this point i was *barely* bleeding but it just wouldn't stop, so i asked the on-call doc at what point should i go to the ER and what i should do if it doesn't stop. she said not to worry because it's such a small amount, and to continue with what i was doing. she also recommended taking a mix of 50/50 hydrogen peroxide and cold water, and holding it in the back of my throat. this worked! this was the only thing that actually made it stop bleeding, but every time i would swallow it would disrupt the clot so i would need to do ice and the mixture again, and this process went on for about an hour. after it finally stopped bleeding, i sucked on ice chips for 3 hours and i was incredibly anxious. i was scared to eat or do anything besides suck on ice. i was so anxious to the point where my gf decided to call the on-call doc again, and she said if it stopped i should return to normal, and i should try to eat so the clot doesn't build up and bleed again.\n\nonce i got over my fear of bleeding, i felt GREAT. it was a HUGE turnaround. i had barely any pain, had so much energy, and felt nearly normal. it was insane! everyone said there would be 1 day that would flip the switch and it was day 8 for me! i was so relieved. i stopped taking tylenol on this day.\n\n**Day 9: pain 0/10 | swallowing 1/10 | discomfort 0/10**\n\nagain, feeling nearly normal!!! the next few days were so easy it was hard to remember i still had scabs and needed to be careful. i started eating whatever i wanted that was soft, and i find that the more i eat the more the scabs fall off.\n\n**Day 10: pain 0/10 | swallowing 1/10 | discomfort 0/10**\n\n**Day 11: pain 0/10 | swallowing 0.5/10 | discomfort 0/10**\n\n**Day 12: pain 0/10 | swallowing 0.25/10 | discomfort 0/10**\n\ni'm on day 12 now and the most frustrating thing is still having scabs! they're very thin, and every day i see improvement, but they're still there. otherwise i feel 100%!\n\nSorry this was SOOO long, but I hope it's helpful!

Today, Day 8 had another blood clot, ended up dislodging and about 15/20 minutes and bleeding stopped again, went in to the ER where they had me \"aggressively gargle water\" to try and cause it to bleed again so they knew where to cauterize it - no such luck and sent me home. I'm trying to hopefully not have anymore blood clot issues. The ER doctor said NOTHING about trying to eat more so the blood clot doesn't happen again - honestly I've been hoarding my ice chips and water just fingers crossing that was the last time. Looks like I'm going to try and eat normal and hopefully it can prevent another episode. \n\nThanks for all the tips and hopefully these help!!",

That had me thinking I might have a tough recovery but things seem to be going ok so far. \n\nI stayed overnight in the private hospital and it was the best decision, if you had any questions you had a nurse with you in 10seconds, the good drugs if you were in pain, surgeon check up and the anaesthesiologist popped in after to see how you were. \n\nSo far, my aching ears are the worst part, it just doesn’t stop unless you’re sleeping. I’m on paracetamol and ibuprofen with Tramadol if the pain gets too much. Tramadol helps me get to sleep and sleep a solid 4 hours.",

Unfortunately I don’t think there’s much that fixes it other than time :/ you can try gently gargling with water but be really careful because you don’t want to disturb your wounds! Greatest risk of bleeding days are around days 1-2 and 6-9 (when scabs form and when they fall off, although bleeds can happen at any point in the 14 days post op). Best thing to do is leave it be (easier said than done), it’ll dislodge eventually.\n\nI think maybe I had luck because for the first week I stuck to a mostly liquid diet (mostly ensure and pediasure), but that’s really hard mentally and honestly not much different benefit-wise than a soft food diet.",

I know I have sensitive acne prone skin.  but it is often dry and flakey.  the only time I get oily is when I am wearing makeup, which I do very often. I think I might have hormonal acne, because I will break out with hard cystic acne a couple of weeks out of the month, then it will calm down after my monthly cycle ends.  \n\nother problems: I get very bad cystic acne deep in my skin. I usually only get these on my chin or around my mouth, but I have recently gotten a couple of the left side of face on my upper cheeks.  I have large pores the are constantly clogged.  I have these weird small bumps that look like they are filled with gunk but are hard to pop.  i also have clogged pore looking things that i can squeeze and a never ending noodle of puss will come out (sorry to be so gross im just trying to explain what i deal with) not to mention little white heads here and there.  but most the the problems are around my mouth/lips and on the apples of my cheeks/around my nose area\n\nwhat ive tried to do: first of all let me say i cant afford to go to a derm, but i am not opposed to seeing an esthetician if it is affordable.  i have been using aveeno clear complexion foaming face wash to wash my face, makeup removing cloths before i wash, then i use face moisturizer.  but i have just started using OCM with castor oil and avocado oil.  I have done A TON of research on this before i started so Im almost positive im doing it right BUT i got a HUGE HARD cyst on my chin the day after starting :(\n\nother products i may use:\nlush's celestial moisturizer,\nLUSH enchanted eye cream,\nolay day time moisturizer,\nwitch hazel (not often),\nst ives exfoliating pads (2x a week),\ni also don't use towels to dry my face i let it air dry and pat some of the water with my hands\n\ni have also used a couple of other products that i actually really like, but im not sure if they are doing my face any good, or actually may be causing some of my problems. i will list the product, how i use it, and the ingredients because they are lesser known:\n\nOSEA ADVANCED PROTECTION CREAM: I use this at night before bed after i wash my face, before i put moisturizer on...\nits supposed to even hyper pigmentation, fine lines, and stimulate collagen production:\nINGREDIENTS: aqua, algae extract*, dipalmitoyl, hydroxproline, coco caprylate/caprate, cetearyl glucoside, olive, glycerin*, aloe barbadensis leaf juice*, macadamia seed oil*, grape seed oil*, jojoba seed oil*, capryloyl glycin, vitamin E, avacodo oil*, chondrus crispus*, undecylenoyl glycin, glycine, calendula officinalis flower extract, anthemis nobilis flower extract*, potassium ascorbyl tocopheryl phosphate (natural vitamin C), citrus medicalimonum peel oil*, xanthan gum, sodium benzodate, potassium sorbate (*certified organic) ( 100% natural derived ingredients) \n\nOSEAS red algae mask: HG mask for me at the moment. when i have a cystic acne break out it soothes my face and helps ease the pain and i always feel like my acne is less inflamed and my skin has a slight glow after using this. i use this 1x a week but not every week...\nINGREDIENTS:  red algae gel extract, glycerin, corrective oil complex, cocoglucoside and coconut alcohol, sodium lauroyl oat amino acid, French red clay, frech pink clay, magnesium aluminum, silicate, cahadian willowbark extract, multifruit extract, sesame oil. jojoba oil, sodium magnesium aspartate, water lily extract, chamomile extract, red wine extract, lactic acid, vitamin e, calendula extract, greentea extract, grapefruit seed extract, xanthan gum, phenoxyetanol\n\ni also have a face lotion that i use on my infant son, and i was wondering if i could use it as a gentle face lotion:\nnatures baby face and body lotion:\ningredients:\norganic aloe barbadenis leaf juice, safflower seed oil, ethylhexyl palminate (from coconut), glycerl stearate, sorbitan olivate, shea butter, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, olive fruit oil, jojoba seed oil, glycerin, rosa centifolia flower water, natural vitamin E, cellulose gum, xanthan gum, organic comfrey extract, organic chamomilla matricaria flower extract, organic calendula flower extract, amino acid, amino acids, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, glycine, citric acid\n\n\n\nso that's it! any help/advice/words will be very appreciated !\n\nthanks for reading.

Based on the items you have in your collection, I'd say a month or two of saving will be sufficient to cover the costs. If you're THAT against it, stick with the OCM for at least six weeks before switching it up. \n\n-EDIT-\n\nAlso remove any foaming cleansers you have - they're not good for sensitive acne prone skin. They mess with the pH balance - you want your skin to be more acidic than base as that acid helps kill bacteria.",

This has been a point of controversy for a while, even though the parabens are supposed to be food-grade, and I've heard Lush is trying to phase out preservatives altogether eventually... somehow (formulations for a lot of products would have to change, though).\n\nThere are also \"essential components\", which are fragrances derived from essential oils or synthetic compounds, which is how we get products that smell the same (like Honey I Washed the Kids has the same fragrance as It's Raining Men).\n\nThat all said, if it works for you, it just does. A lot of times, synthetic can actually be better, especially for people who are intolerant of natural essential oils. I'm sensitive to them in certain quantities myself (which is why the $90 Gorgeous moisturizer we have actually breaks me out!). Vanishing Cream doesn't do much for me, and feels tacky on my skin because of the shea butter content, despite the claims of being really light.\n\nI'd have to say Ultrabland is the best product by far for acne-prone skin, as far as Lush products go.\nBut I'm a big fan of Nude Cosmetics and also Kate Somerville!

It might be worth it to at least get a consultation with a derm (some do that for free), get some recommendations/samples, and then ask your GP to prescribe you things. I generally am pretty against recommending Accutane, but I think it's worth it for people who have that sort of painful, deep cystic acne, especially if it's causing you a lot of emotional distress. I have no idea if a GP can prescribe Accutane, though.\n\nI notice you said you have an infant son. Were you on any kind of birth control before you had him? Have you ever been on birth control? Cystic acne is frequently related to hormones. Can you see an OB/GYN? They would at least be able to talk to you about that, and if you are ok with going on birth control or other hormonal meds, that might help.\n\nI agree with what most other commenters are saying, though. Drop the multitude of heavily fragranced Lush products and start over from scratch with some gentle products like CeraVe and maybe some oils. Seeing an esthetician might be worth it just so someone can see your skin and guide you through treating it irl, but don't let anyone try to sell you miracle products.

I now spend over thousands on lasers and products in hopes of blurring the scars and all not very successful. My biggest regret is not saving to go see a derm (I was young, no insurance, and a student) so I was afraid I would be in debt. Guess what? A Dr.'s visit is around $100-200 depending on location. If I had done my research instead of avoiding it in fear, I would *gladly* pay $500 or more. The amount of money I spend on products thinking I'd save money sure adds up. I have also went to estheticians and that didn't help because what I had (deep cystic acne) needed medical attention, not just the upper epidermis. Please think about it. If only I did... :'(",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nJust wanted to put out a quick review on this mask.  I hardly ever use sheet masks as most of them make me itchy (even the Klairs Supple Prep mask).  Luckily, this one did not and really hydrated my skin, which lasts through the next day.\n\nThese are pretty good!  Maybe even great, depending on your skin's needs.\n\nThey come split into two parts.  The mask material itself is cross-hatched and sturdy.  You can give it a good tug while fitting it on our face and it's no big deal.  Other than that, it feels like regular mask material (cotton).  The fit for me was good.  It was definitely big enough to cover most my (normal-sized) face with a bit to spare.  \n\nVery saturated with the juice.  It's not a creamy formula, just the usual serum style.  And get this...NO FRAGRANCE.  I know many people love the nice smelling stuff, but this one is great option for people who can't tolerate it.  Plus it has tons of ceramides.\n\nIn terms of how long until the masks drys out...well I've never made it that far.  I wore one yesterday for 40min (youtube! stop being so distracting!), pulled it off and it was still soggy.\n\n\n**Ingredients List:** Water, Butylene glycol, glycerin, 1,2-hexanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycereth-26, Propanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Betaine, Allantoin, Cellulose, Hydroxyethyl cellulose, Sodium hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydrogenated lecithin, Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Arginine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Acetate, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Glyceryl Acrylate/ Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n\nOverall, I would rate this mask positively.  It's hydrating and benign...which is what I look for in a mask.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\nGood material\n\nNo fragrance\n\nHydrating AF\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\nCost (USD 3$/mask)\n\n\nEdit: my goodness I need to learn to spell",

Outside of this the doctor made the recommendation to start taking PPIs which I refused because of the reports of their carcinogenic effects. \n\nI tried a variety of natural remedies from aloe Vera juice but what was really a game changer was kefir.

I take it 2/3 times/day, but for sure once in the morning and before bed. Of course, it’s not a cure for everyone but I’d encourage you to try it if you haven’t. \n\nWarm regards, ",

    "body": "SIBO and parasites are connected. You should check this : Growth of Intestinal Pathogenic Organisms🦠🪱\n\nAnyone taking the natural path? Like NAC + enzymes for biofilm (the bunker of SIBO and parasites) — that’s why your body can’t kill the bad bacteria. 🫠\n\nIntestinal biofilms are actually very frequent in the colon of IBS patients, contributing to low-grade, chronic fermentation.\n\nThen comes the anti-parasite/SIBO cleanse. New Roots cleanse is great.\n\nCleanses release toxins — so zeolite and activated charcoal are great to counter them after the cleanse.\n\n(By the way, I speak French — sorry if my spelling is off.)\n\nBile is related to SIBO. Bad bile ➡️ bad digestion ➡️ fermentation ➡️ bad bacteria in the small intestine ➡️ nutrient deficiency.\n\nMMC is important too. Ginger and artichoke extract help. But you probably already know that  with the guy on yt. (How I cure my sibo).\n\n⸻\n\nDoes anyone have: • Anemia • Abdominal pain • Burping all the time with a “musty” or rotten egg smell (fermentation) • Brain fog • Blood in the urine • Grinding teeth • Pressure in the plexus? (Vagus nerve linked to duodenum)\n\nNegative emotions too — I feel like the stomach is deeply linked to emotion.\n\nAnemic? If yes — check for hookworms. They consume EPO — the hormone from the kidneys that produces red blood cells. And with D-lactic acid, plus SIBO, it gets worse.\n\nMore info on anemia at the end.\n\nI tested anemic when I was 6. Always tired, always sleeping — at school, at home. Doctors couldn’t find my problem. I don’t follow that path anymore. They’re not helping. And honestly, that’s not even their goal.\n\n⸻\n\nJust take cancer for example — $2.5 trillion in revenue for 2024–2025. A good client is not a healthy client. A healthy client doesn’t come back…\n\nYou’re better off trusting nature than trusting a system that profits when you’re sick. If you don’t think like this — don’t comment please. Tired of hearing the structure speak.\n\n⸻\n\nI know a lot about this — message me if you do too. It might help us both.\n\nIf you read this far, it’s because you’re tired of this. I understand you. Brain fog, tiredness — they can’t understand what it feels like. Keep fighting, boss. 🫡\n\n⸻\n\nMore info:\n\nSIBO and parasites create toxins — and a lot of those toxins end up in your bile.\n\nNormal bile has powerful antimicrobial action in the small intestine. If the bile is low quality (too little produced, poorly evacuated, or saturated with toxins), it can’t sterilize the terrain. Low levels of bile acids = bacterial overgrowth and inflammation. Weak bile lets fermentative bacteria thrive and steal nutrients that should’ve been absorbed. If bile is redirected too early to the colon (bile malabsorption), it can cause bile diarrhea — and your small intestine stays unprotected.\n\n⸻\n\nThere’s a video on YouTube showing parasites in the duodenum. They love that spot — it’s where bile flows in. That’s why you can’t digest properly. When I say parasites, I mean SIBO too. They both feed on your bile.\n\nKill the biofilm = kill the SIBO and parasites. Clean your bile = it will do the rest. Healthy bile = proper digestion.\n\n⸻\n\n🔁 Protocol (simplified):\n\nStep 1 – Kill the biofilm: • NAC (600 mg) • Serrapeptase enzymes\n\nStep 2 – Kill parasites/SIBO: • New Roots antiparasitic cure\n\nStep 3 – Clean and support bile flow: • Herbal teas (e.g. Detox Liver by Phytovie) • Nutripur combo: Boldo, black radish, artichoke ⚠️ If you’ve had SIBO/parasites for a long time, go slow — too much bile = too many toxins at once.\n\nSupport mucus evacuation + inflammation: • Triphala • Aloe vera juice • Slippery elm\n\nToxin binders: • Chlorophyll • Zeolite • Activated charcoal • Green clay\n\nDestroying the biofilm makes the mucosa sensitive in the short term — that’s why there’s inflammation. But dissolving it is a necessary pain in the long run. You can’t fully eliminate SIBO or parasites without breaking the biofilm — the treatments never reach what’s hiding inside.\n\n⸻\n\nYou’d be surprised how long parasites can stay in the body and how they reprogram your entire system. They’re VERY smart — next level.\n\nJust like your body. I find it strange how there’s always an equal force behind everything. Maybe heaven or hell isn’t “after” — maybe we’re in it now.\n\nThe opposite is always there. You choose. You research. Or you stay in it. Doctors want you sick. They won’t help you.\n\nYour life path is unique. Change the cycle. 🔄\n\n⸻\n\nAnemia.\n\nHookworms attach to your intestinal wall and suck your blood — just enough to keep you anemic. They also consume EPO, the kidney hormone responsible for red blood cell production. And from what I understand, they cause iron loss when they hook into your tissue. Basically, your whole oxygenation system becomes compromised.\n\nAnd that’s just hookworms — there are tons of other parasites and bacteria. They’re smart. They rewire your biology. Your nerves. Your emotions.\n\nNeed proof? Go on YouTube. Look up acupressure or massage points for liver and gallbladder nerves. Try massaging around your ribs. A lot of people feel crazy pain.🚑🕺🏻\n\n⸻\n\nInflammation:\n\nInflammation is the body’s way of protecting itself. When it’s there, your system goes into defense mode — and stops absorbing nutrients properly.\n\nAntioxidants signal safety. They tell your body “you’re okay now.” That’s when you rest, heal, rebuild. That’s the break your system needs.🎁\n\nInflammation is useful when something’s wrong. But chronic inflammation? That’s something else. If you don’t calm it down, disease starts to develop.\n\n⸻\n\nYou ever feel thoughts that aren’t yours? Impulses, anxiety, dreams that don’t feel like you?\n\nThat’s not random — some bacteria and parasites release neurochemicals. They feed on sugar… but they also feed on attention.\n\nListen to your body — it speaks more than you think.\n\nIf your doctor still says “everything looks normal” — but your mind isn’t clear, your belly talks all night, and your soul feels stuck… How much longer are you going to wait to trust your own experience?\n\nI’m not saying you have all the symptoms I do. I’m saying you should trust yourself — because no one else will. It starts with you.\n\n⸻\n\nHope you’re okay. 🍀 Message me. Like and comment if this helped — you could help someone else🎁",

It's how they communicate that \"treatment is coming, put up our armor!\" The many layers of a fully formed biofilm (if you have been sick for more than a year) need cracking with different natural agents.

Based off all of my research, it seems like sibo isnt even a disease itself, but more of a symptom you know? I think that's why they havent developed a cure to it even though again, based off research, normalizing motlity would in theory completely cure sibo. Then again, there is biofilms which is like the disruptor to that theory, it really is just trying to hit the broad side of a barn at this point.",

        "body": "Ok question... are you SURE it's as bad as you think it is? 🤔\n\nHere's my take..\n\nThis is literally your hairline. On everyone the hairline is much less dense and the hairs themselves are much finer than everywhere else. \n\nThis means that a little totally normal shedding might be far more noticeable in this area.\n\nBut also, I've noticed due to this fineness in the hairline thing that when I'm in need of a retie the locs on my hairline can look almost bald/hanging on by a thread when in truth they are no thinner or weaker than ever and after a retie i can't even remember where exactly my concern was. \n\nIf you are getting breakage, one issue can be Glycerin. Glycerin can be really great. It draws moisture to itself. But when it runs out of water to pull out of the atmosphere it'll start pulling it out of your hair 😣\n\nThe problem is when you therefore live in a dry climate or are in Central heat or AC ..it gets so dry so fast. A good idea to get the benefits of Glycerin without the drawbacks are to only use the Glycerin based product one time for every 3-4 times you use water only. Another would be more thorough daily exposure to moisture. For example, sleep with a humidifier on in the room.\n\nWhen are you doing the next retie? Comparing your freshly done locs between last time and this time in the orblem areas will give you the best comparison and full back in the illusion sparse areas so you can see what you're really dealing with.",

It was here for me when I was brand new and now that I've been around a while i love being able to give others what was once given to me 😉\n\nAnother thing I was thinking was that in the pic it does NOT look like you're lacking any hair follicles. \n\nThis reminded me of me. In the same hair line area I've had this sensation since starting the locs of feeling it and it's BALD feeling entirely, but it's not in reality.\n\nWhat I came to realize eventually was this was a combo of the parting, which is supposed to be bald cuz it's a PART lol but I'm not used to my hair being parted there in the hairline in a tiny little box. \n\nThe second thing was that starting locs made my sebum production SKYROCKET. Suddenly my sebum was so plentiful and it was being distributed so quickly. So that super smooth feeling, for me, was actually really our superb thick sebum fully coating the scalp and hair in that area and me having zero idea of what that would feel like before. \n\nNot sure if this is your deal also but I'm thinking... like this all happened for me about 3-5 weeks into my journey and I haven't thought about it in forever... so it seems like this popping into my head MIGHT be because it applies?\n\nI dunno. But I will say that it's maybe a good idea to go in for a consult for these areas. At the end of the day it's not like you're DIY, so you should report the issue to your loctitian now so that they can best manage the situation. They will probably ask you to come in for a consult so they can see it in person and make sure things are OK and if not do what's necessary to course correct Stat.",

Planning it out where you cut your bars helps make it more polished. It can be frustrating getting the consistency of the soap frosting correct, primarily because I scent my frosting, and that just makes it harder. Using it in the correct design can add a lot to the bar, and I think the soap I piped in this picture set was a poor design choice to pipe, but I wanted to put an embed in it, so in retrospect I think I should have designed either the base or piping differently. So basically, if you enjoy trying out new things, definitely give it go, but I don't think piping automatically makes a bar aesthetically better. It's a practice makes better sort of thing, but it can be very satisfying when you do pull it off. If your interested, give it a go! I use my regular soap recipe, not a special frosting recipe, but I can get away with it because my recipe is primarily hard oils. \n\nI will give a tip that helped me...I buy piping tips that are roughly the size of my bars..so, if I make one inch bars, I try to stick with tips that make one inch blobs. I mark my loaf where I will cut my bars, and I pipe one dollop per bar, right next to each other. Makes it so I'm not piping a million teeny dollops, plus, when I cut my bars, each one gets one entire whole row of piping.",

    "body": "This is my story of reclaiming my life from the grips of chronic acid reflux (GERD). It's not just about managing symptoms – it's about understanding my body and making peace with my digestive system.\n\nFor years, I lived in fear of food. Every meal felt like a gamble. Would this be the one that sends me into a spiral of heartburn, regurgitation, and that terrible burning sensation in my chest? I'd wake up coughing in the middle of the night, my throat raw from stomach acid. Simple pleasures like coffee with friends or enjoying a family dinner became sources of anxiety.\n\nThe turning point wasn't finding the perfect medication (though those helped). It was realizing that my digestive system wasn't my enemy – it was sending me important messages that I needed to learn to understand.\n\nThe first breakthrough came when I started treating my esophagus as a sensitive friend rather than a broken machine. Instead of just popping antacids and hoping for the best, I began paying attention to patterns. Which foods triggered symptoms? What times of day were worst? How did stress affect my digestion?\n\nI discovered that my reflux wasn't just about what I ate – it was about how I ate. Rushing through meals during lunch breaks, eating large portions late at night, and stress-eating while working were all contributing to my symptoms. My body wasn't malfunctioning; it was begging me to slow down.\n\nMeal timing became my secret weapon. Rather than three large meals, I switched to smaller, more frequent portions that didn't put as much pressure on my lower esophageal sphincter. I learned to eat dinner at least three hours before bed, giving my stomach time to empty before lying down.\n\nPosture played a surprisingly important role. Simply sitting up straight during meals and avoiding slouching at my desk made a noticeable difference. I started taking short walks after meals instead of immediately returning to work or collapsing on the couch.\n\nThe hardest part? Saying goodbye to some of my favorite foods. Tomato-based sauces, citrus fruits, chocolate, and my beloved morning coffee were major triggers. But instead of viewing this as deprivation, I turned it into an adventure of finding new favorites. I discovered the joy of herbal teas, learned to make creamy non-acidic sauces, and found ways to add flavor without aggravating my symptoms.\n\nSleep became a crucial focus. Elevating the head of my bed (not just using extra pillows) made a dramatic difference in my nighttime symptoms. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine helped reduce stress-related acid production.\n\nSpeaking of stress – it was perhaps the biggest revelation. During particularly stressful periods, my symptoms would flare regardless of what I ate. This led me to explore stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and gentle yoga. These practices didn't just help my reflux; they improved my overall quality of life.\n\nBuilding a supportive medical team was essential. Finding a doctor who listened to my concerns and worked with me to find the right combination of lifestyle changes and medications made all the difference. We discovered that my reflux was worse during certain times of the month, allowing me to anticipate and prepare for challenging periods.\n\nI learned to assemble a toolkit for flare-ups: loose, comfortable clothing, natural remedies like ginger tea and aloe vera juice, breathing exercises, and positioning techniques. Having these tools ready helped reduce the anxiety around potential symptoms.\n\nThe most unexpected lesson? How interconnected our digestive health is with our emotional well-being. As I learned to listen to my body's signals and respond with compassion rather than frustration, both my symptoms and my stress levels improved.\n\nTo anyone struggling with GERD – know that you're not alone. This condition can be isolating and frustrating, but there is hope. Your journey might look different from mine, but healing is possible. It's not just about finding the right medications or eliminating trigger foods; it's about creating a lifestyle that supports your digestive health.\n\nTake it one day at a time. Celebrate small victories. Be patient with yourself as you learn your triggers and find your balance. Your body isn't fighting against you – it's trying to communicate with you.\n\nRemember, managing acid reflux is a journey, not a destination. There will be good days and challenging days, but with understanding, patience, and the right support, you can find your path to healing.\n\nTrust in your body's wisdom. You've got this. 💫",

( take cabbage juice 3 times a day before each meal and whatnot ) just water and cabbage and blend . And remember stay consistent or don’t complain . I can say bc I was a big complainer and did nothing to help myself but I was sick of it so I had to do something . (REMINDER EVERYONES DIFFERENT ) ALSO MAKE SURE UR CABBAGE IS THE CABBAGE WITH THE BIG DARK GREEN LEAVES MY JUICE IS DARK GREEN , the white cabbage sucked still helped but compared to green cabbage it didn’t do much but the green one cured me ",

Some of us are poor and can’t keep spending money on all different types of supplements/natural remedies that more often than not give us zero results. \n\nYou say “most people” will be helped by these remedies, but it’s based off your experience as one person. Unfortunately cabbage is not good for people with IBS, which is a very common comorbidity of gastritis. A “GI tract supplement” is so non-specific, there’s so many out there with all different types of ingredients. Some may work for some people, many won’t make any difference at all, and some could even hurt. It’s expensive to test so many different supplements. \n\nI’m very happy for you and your healing!

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

So, it looks like the new formula might be ok for me but it also might be too soon to tell. She did confirm that there was no email regarding the change. \n\nHowever, the more I think about it, the more upset I get that Curology did not properly notify everyone about this formula change. They certainly have a right to change the formula, but people have a right to know what they are putting on their skin as well. Because Curology does not list ALL the ingredients on the bottle, I believe an email notification was the right thing to do. As you said, there’s a chance I would have started to break out after years of being clear and not have the proper information to determine the possible cause. \n\nFurthermore, since Curology has chosen to not be transparent about formula changes, how am I supposed to know when the next change will occur? It seems silly to have to message my provide rot confirm the ingredients each time I receive a new bottle. \n\nBasically, I don’t know if I trust Curology anymore and and will probably cancel my account. I really hope they reconsider and send out an email and are more transparent in the future.",

Like W T F.\n\nHow well can a product be working when it just sits on top of your face and rubs off if you touch it?\n\nI think the logical solution (and what they should have done in the first place) is announce the new FA friendly formula alongside the original as an OPTION, and allow the customers to choose which one they prefer. I mean, it's pretty basic skincare knowledge that some people's skin NEEDS oil, and some react badly to oil. Soo.... \n\nMy provider also said she'd pass on my complaints, and advised me to contact customer support directly. So i did just that. Their response? \"We'll pass this onto your provider so they can discuss it with you\" 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️\n\nThen they told me the would add a $24 credit to my account \"for a complimentary shipment next month\"\nREALLY? A free bottle of the cream i literally just told you I hate?? Not to mention, the bottle of the new formula i unknowingly purchased was $40, because it was the 2 month supply.\nI wrote back AGAIN and went off about how insulting that was, and how about they just refund me for the bottle they DUPED me into buying without telling me what it wasn't the same thing i agreed to be billed for.\nThey finally did, but it was a really curt one-sentence response that basically came across as \"FINE, we'll give you your goddamn refund.

She said “just try applying your moisturizer immediately afterwards”... uhhhhh THANKS?? That doesn’t fix the problem with your product... And there’s no way to get a bottle of the old formula. I’m hoping they get enough complaints to where they change it back — or at least something that’s like the exact same but replace the macadamia nut oil for the FA people.

It makes them seem pretty money hungry instead of being an upfront skincare company.  \n  \nAs to your comment about the pilling, I havent tried it yet so I cant say for sure, but the old formula was oil based and the new one is water based.

    "body": "I mentioned I was getting a colonic in a post yesterday and someone asked me to post about it so here goes.\n\nAfter being horribly constipated in spite of upping my fiber intake and trying at home laxatives, I decided to get a colonic. I've always had trouble going but it was much worse once I started keto. Around the same time I also acknowledged that I needed to cut out dairy (or at least cut back drastically) as it was affecting my gut and my skin and who knows what else. In the last few days with increased vegetable consumption, BPC in the mornings and very minimal dairy (a lil goat cheese in a frittata) I started to go more frequently. However my BMs were very ropey, and not normal.\n\nMy friend recommended someone she had seen last year when she was having some troubles and he had only 5 star yelp reviews so I booked a session with him. He sent over an instruction sheet to basically eat just vegetables and oraginc free range chicken or wild salmon for three days in advance (no sweat!) and fast for 24 hour before and drink fresh juice in that 24 hours. I was a little nervous about the juice but there was a place here that has a cucumber/celery/spinach/kale/parsley/ginger/lemon blend so I ordered two of those and a wheatgrass shot for good measure. I figured if they knocked me out of ketosis it wasn't the end of the world and I might as well follow the instructions. I don't think it knocked me out because I have felt totally fine. I also drank a cup of bone broth for lunch, some hippy electrolyte stuff. Also aloe vera juice on an empty stomach for the 3 days leading up to it, as instructed. \n\nWhen I arrived he asked me to disrobe below the waist and lay on the bed with a sheet over my lower half (about mid thigh to mid belly. Then he came in and we set an intention for the session (here in Portland, Oregon, this is very normal, haha). He then said he wanted me to take a deep breath and as I exhaled he would insert the tube in my rectum. It was totally painless. The piece that they insert has 2 tubes coming out, one in for the water and one out for the waste but there is just one uh tube in your rectum. Sorry its kind of hard to explain! Then he said he was going to turn on the water and used his hand to kind of pulse the tube which he said mimics the body's own way of going to the bathroom. We did this and what he called a flush where he filled me up with water (while closing the exit tube) until I was just uncomfortable and would then release the exit tube flushing out all kinds of crap. Yes literal crap.... I was on my side for the first half and then on my back with my legs up for the second half. We went through this maybe 4-5 times over the course of an hour and then he said I was done. He kept telling me what a good job I was doing and that I had tons of crap in my system and this was really going to help me feel better. When we were done he pulled out the tube out and a little water and excrement came out onto the what looked like puppy pads, lol, on the table. He instructed me to use the toilet and then left the room.\n\nOkay, but like how did it FEEL right? It was weird for sure, but also I felt huge relief. He said that since I had been so constipated there was probably blockage in my system which explained the ropey poops. It wasn't painful but the sensation definitely felt foreign and yeah essentially pooping out a tube in front of a stranger is a little odd but he made me very at ease. Now, post colonic I feel good but not too different, maybe a little lighter. I'm going to do some yoga tonight and see how that goes, he said I would probably have more flexibility in my core. \n\nA colonic just flushes out the colon, but doesn't affect the small intestine so they usually recommend going back in 7-10 days to get another since the small intestine might be impacted as well. I need to check my budget but I will definitely go back if I can afford it.\n\nI'll update this thread tomorrow with any developments. I'm kind pretty excited to weigh myself and see how much crap I got flushed out of my body. haha\n\nTLDR: I was constipated so I got a colonic and it wasn't weird at all.",

I definitely could have continued to struggle with my bowels but I literally wanted that shit out. I never called this a cleanse. I never gave this procedure any lofty claims beyond flushing out turds, which it definitely did. I never mentioned toxins. I only talked about my constipation issues. \n\nHopefully our combined resources can help people figure out what works best for their bodies.",

There was also a little blood when I wiped, but that seems to have resolved itself and is not uncommon for someone with the issues I was having apparently. Since the urge/nothing happening was stressing me out I decided to take half (.5mg) of xanax and a muscle relaxer. I promptly fell asleep.... for FOURTEEN HOURS. Who knows if this was the drugs or just my body recuperating or likely both. When I jumped on the scale I was down THREE POUNDS. which is pretty nuts! I know a lot of this weiht will come back as my colon fills up but I'm hoping with me new diet (just meat, veggies, oils and the occasional nuts) will keep things moving. \n\nI would definitely recommend this as a last resort but so far I am please with the results.

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Thank you for the reviews.\n\nI've seen FMC go upto 35%off on kindlife & 30%off on their own website.\n\nEdit - I have fine 2a wavy hair, & medium porosity from what I can tell. I'm hair dumb tbh. I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture. So sm1 with Frizzy or dry hair would need other more rich / moisturizing products.\n\nThe leave in cream & mousse are my more used products, I haven't quite figured out how to use the gel properly yet.",

Thankfully I recently managed to recover from gastritis without PPIs and I wanted to share my story.\n\nMy recovery steps as follows:\n\n1. Eliminate stress\n\nMy chronic gastritis was stress induced. I meditated every day to manage my stress. This is a very important step that many people miss.\n\n2. Dietary changes\n\nThe food in my company was not very gastritis friendly. I stick to salad bar at work for a couple of months until I get better. I prepared myself a healthy dinner when I get home. I also completely eliminated redmeat, processed food, refined sugar, cheese, and tomatoes. I only consumed bananas pears and watermelon as fruits. For drinks, I only had coconut water and soft herbal teas. Coconut water was very soothing for my stomach.\n\n3. Supplements\n\nI took pepzin gi and organic aloe vera juice every day.\n\nIt took about three months for my gastritis to heal 90%. My endoscopy was clear. I am so happy that I can tolerate coffee, pizza, and fries. The only thing that I cannot tolerate much is the alcohol. I still can enjoy a glass of wine. Just believe in yourself that you can recover.\n\nPs: I also had occasional cheat meals and deserts (such as cheesecake or oreos) during my recovery. I wasn’t very strict on my diet.\n\nEdit: as of today (april 2022), I can tolerate alcohol for 90%. I sometimes feel discomfort next day if I drink more than 2 cocktails mixed with coca cola. Wine doesn’t hurt my stomach.",

I call it the 4 stages of gastritis/healing. Stage 4 is the worst where everything you eat causes pain, inflammation, and loads of gas. For me ANY meat my stomach can not tolerate jut yet but breads, rice, and veggies are ok. I would consider myself a stage 3 progress but not quite there yet.

The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

Meanwhile, there is a laundry list of other brands that routinely cause people break outs and no one breaks out the pitchforks.\n\nANYWAY. I have tried a few times to contact them via their Twitter account to ask, wth-when will you properly preserve these products? Because I seriously love the Snail Bee Essence and have yet to have a single issue personally, but it sure would be great to be able to recommend them with more confidence. My queries were ignored.\n\nSo I recently tried reaching out via their Facebook account. I had actually forgotten I asked and [had this message this morning back from them.](http://imgur.com/kWr7MfS) \n\nI honestly don't know a lot about preservatives and types.

As of yet I have seen zero factual sources that supports that they are harmful and throwing around E.

I honestly follow all Benton related post and have yet to see more than the same two people say at one point, their product turned a color other than clear. And this is some time ago. \n\nIf the spoilage rate is so incredibly high and unstable, how is this still on the market? How is it so popular (and getting more so all the time)?\n\nSo are you saying you could leave AA-2g open and in sunlight and nothing would happens to it? Does it have the same effectiveness/properties as LAA? If not, it's a moot comparison. \n\nFinally, I really just don't understand why people have such a hard-on about why no one should use their products yet, there are likely hundreds of people here using their products without ill effect or spoilage. Obviously their light preservative system is doing *something*. Are there specific studies that say \"this natural preservative system combined with Pentylene glycol is completely ineffective\"? Because again, all my googling led to only pg being a booster of natural preservatives, not ineffective. \n\nProbably there is no specific study. But we accept the mythology of loads of ingredients potential effectiveness in this sub. If we did not, there would hardly be anyone using any AB products as so many star ingredients don't have a lot of studies behind them. \n\nMeaning, just because Benton may be the \"only\" ones using the preservative system, doesn't mean it doesn't work. Cosmetic companies generally bend  to consumer perception whether or not there is any real truth behind it. How many AB products brag about no parabens? Or no sulfates? Or no animal testing when they still use the initial animal studies that *were done in the past* as a basis for what they will or won't use in a formula? I have a feeling there are people here who would not use their products if the top 3 ingredients were mainstream preservatives. \n\nAnd finally no one is making anyone use anything they don't want to use.\n\nI made the OP to highlight a change, that's it.

I used this in the AM. Doesn’t react with tret creams.

I loved using it and so did my friends after purchasing it on my recommendation. The witch hazel was the right amount so it did not strip off my skin. It also had some moisturising ingredients because my face did feel supple after use. Although since the production has begun in India and someone said the quality of the moisturiser has deteriorated so did not repurchase.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist PHA Toner** {*bought on a friends recommendation*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not using currently*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Inulin, Lactococcus Ferment Lysate, Saccharide Isomerate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid, Allantoin, Glycerin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate. \n\nBrief review: I did not like this toner and I was very hopeful for this toner because it had good reviews, great ingredients and budget price point.. For me the one major requirement in a toner it for it to be of a water consistency, and this has a slightly thick syrupy consistency which just did not suit my skin. I kept getting small bumps and breakouts all over my face and this did not soothe my skin or make is feel supple. This also did not layer well with my actives and instead just made my face feel heavy after using it.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One Thing H. Cordata Extract** {*self bought - youtuber influenced purchase*}\n\nUsage: 9 weeks {*currently using in the AM/PM*}\n\nIngredients:  Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexaniediol\n\nBrief review: Absolutely in love with this product for its affect on my skin as well as how multifunctional it is. It does what it says and soothes my skin, reduces redness and helps with any irritation caused due to makeup or acne. The only con is the price point is not at all budget friendly. Although I have been using it for the last 9 weeks and have only finished a little more than half the bottle. Although, once I finish this I might try a different one from the ONE THING range.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Serums*\n\n{*Since I was seeing a dermatologist for my acne and acne scars I used a couple of actives that were doctor recommended and since all of those were rx products I would not be reviewing those*}\n\n**Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin + 1% HA** {*bought on reddit recomendation*}\n\nUsage: 7 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin \n\nBrief review: Love it. Since I stopped using all rx products I wanted a serum for my PIH and PIE and reddit had some really good recommendation for this active. So I gave in and bought this and I lve lve love it, in 7 weeks i can see my old pih scars faded and any new red acne I have has a fast healing time after using AA. So definitely have a raving review for this product. I use 2 drops on moist skin (from toner) and it evenly layers out.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Suganda 5% Niacinamide** {*bought after i received a sample*}\n\nUsage: 8 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Niacinamide (5%), Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf (Green Tea) Extract, Sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin \n\nBrief review: Again, very glad that my skin loved this product. It helps boost the effect f my minimalist AA serum. Helps in controlling the oiliness of my very oily skin in summers, and the two ingredients centella asiatica and green tea extract helps spreading 2 drops well on my full face and avoid over usage of products. So, I will 100% keep using this for life because I love it.\n\n>Holy Grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Lactic Acid Serum** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Water, lactic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, gluconolactone, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, sodium hydroxide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, phenoxyethanol, agastache mexicana flower/leaf/stem extract, disodium edta, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: So I used this product twice in a week (in the PM) and this has a cream like consistency and my skin just hated it. I could see red ness and irritation on my skin as soon as I applied it. I even made sure not to use it with any actives but it still did not d anything for my skin and just irritated it. So, it is just lying on my self with no use and my heart hurts because this was so expensive and had god reviews on ig. So this this brand really isn't reliable. I love the moisturiser but this formula just did not work even when my skin is used to strong actives.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Moisturiser*\n\n**Acrofy Acne Lotion** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 1 year + {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: Good/basic moisturiser for acne prone skin, helped me when I had the worst breakouts of my life. It is creamy consistency and does feel a little heavy and doesn't really mattify the skin. Stopped using it because my dermatologist recommended a different one.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow Acne Moisturising Gel** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: This is an ok moisturiser, I don't like fragrance in my moisturiser so I did not really like this but it did not cause any breakouts but did make my face moisturised.

I bought this as the the ingredient list matched the one of formularx barrier relief and this was a budget one so went for this. I tried using a normal amount and it was horrible, I also tried using a very small amount since it is thick and even then it just made my skin sweat and break out. So I stopped using and thought that this might help during winters but again just made my skin suffocate. It is probably a good moisturiser but not for my skin type at all. So now just to finish off the product i use it on my hands or as an eye cream.\n\n>WNRP.

But, nevertheless, the product deserves the love, it is lightweight and still moisturises my skin well. In winters I get weird dry patches on my skin and it peels off. This moisturiser prevented it. It layers well with my actives and makeup and it overall soothing and does the work it claims. I am almost one with my first tube and even though it is expensive, it lasts a good time for me so can call it worth the money.

For your second query it works the same as it did with my skin in summers. My skin feels fully moisturised infact as i said usually over the years my skin used to get big dry peely patches on my face every winters. This time around the moisturiser really helped. Haven’t gotten any such dry patches. So i would definitely recommend the moisturiser. \n\nSide note: a month back I recommended it to a friend of mine and she has a slightly dry skin compared to my very oily skin and it has kept her face moisturised as well and she loves it. :)",

All in all this brand is pretty cool and a small amount goes a long way :)\n\nNiacinamide in aloe based i was anyway i little sceptical, minimalist is such a hit or a miss brand in terms of their products. Anyway with suganda, I actually received a sample of this 5% niacinamide serum with my purchase on sublime and i loved it alot so i ordered the full size version. It is a pretty cool brand especially like the base they use (centella asiatica + green tea extract water) instead of aloe juice. Find it’s ingredients better than minimalist. For formularx i can and will only recommend the barrier cream. I am almost through my 1st tube and about to order the second. The other products (esp the new ones) are gimmicky, i think they invested a lot on the first set of formulas and now are just trying to come up with new new products to stay in the game?\n\nEdit: also thanksss, i love thriller novels and gone girl was something haha.

Too much of a good thing (like antioxidants) can also be a bad thing.

If we can eat clean, live clean, and use cleaner products, we'll avoid all of those assaults.\n\nCancers in our elderly years are likely going to occur anyway due to the fact that aging cells lose their identity and can start behaving like other organ tissue cells.  But if we can do the cleaner living while we're young, we can delay this until much, much later, \"compressing our morbidity\".",

I haven’t tried the BBQ sauce (maybe I will now though because the chip flavor is fantastic and I think it would work well with jackfruit) but I love the chips. I always prefer ridge cut over kettle and it really works here. My only complaint is that most of the chips are pretty small. It’s nice that theyre not massive, but with bigger pieces I can at least break them first.",

It’s incredibly lightweight and doesn’t live shiny finish, it’s semi-matte. It has a light creamy gel texture. It is very easy to reapply. It contains fragrance, but it’s very subtle and goes away quickly. It never makes me look like a greasy mess, there i salso no pilling under makeup! Most importantly, it never irritates my skin. There was no irritation, I noticed that it actually calms down the redness and helps with healing my acne scars.\n\nI can confidently say that it quickly become my HG sunscreen!",

In most of the more famous \"thermal water\" mists, its literally just water and pressure.\n\n\n**a note** I'm not bashing water mists, I own one! I think they are great for what their purpose is, pure hydration. I just find it easier to put some bottles water in a fine mist spray bottle, tbh.\n\n\n**So, what are you getting at here?**\n\nI have skin that (like many of us here) isn't flawless, spotless perfection. So I have been on the hunt for a mist that does more than simply hydrate, be cause we all deserve a mist that can help us with skin problems too, right? I think that some of the issue is, when looking for a mist, we all just assume that **hydration is all we are supposed to get from a mist** & that just didn't sit right with me. I feel like we should at least get a little bit more. Whitening/brightening effects, acne control, sebum control, pore minimizer, etc. I wan't all a mist has to offer!\n\n\n**You said you were on a hunt, did you find anything? Or are you just smack talking?**\n\nThis is why I'm here. I found a few mists that I would like to share and hope to get some recommendations for more! I hope to compile some type of list, so any and all suggestions are welcome. I would especially love some mists from brands that we may not see that often because I'd love to broaden my horizons!\n\n\n**Here are the mists I found so far and their ingredients:** (I hope anyone can add to this)\n\n\n**BENTON Honest TT Mist**\n\nIngredients: Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tee Tree) Leaf Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Altharea Roea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Poly Glutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Psidium Guajava Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract\n\n\n**ELENSILIA Escargot Botanic Garden Bee Venom Lavender Mist**\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Sodium Citrate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil,Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Chlorphenesin, Adenosine, Magnesium Sulfate, Citric Acid, Glycosaminoglycans, Bee Venom, Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Polygonum Multiflorum Root Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Phellinus, Linteus Extract, Angelica Gigas Root Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Paeonia Lactiflora Root Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Galactomyces, Ferment Filtrate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil\n\n\n**Snail White SYN-AKE Mist**\n\nIngredients: Snail secretion filtrate,deionized water, SYN-AKE (dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzalymide diacetate) Alpha arbutin, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Morus nigra fruit extract, rubus idaeus (raspberry extract) Prunus Avium (sweet cherry extract) fragaria vesca (strawberry fruit extract\n\nHonorable mention: I have **TFS Bamboo Water, sebum control mist.** I like it, it controls some oil, hydrates and doesn't have a strong scent. All around, a good buy and I use it occasionally. I can't find the ingredients for it and the bottle I have is in korean.\n\n**Elizavecca Hell-Pore Water Up Peptide EGF Mist One Button**\n\nThis is tough to find ingredients for but I have a summary thanks to u/Perpetuallydrifting\n\nFormulated with Squalane, western flower rose watercollagen, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil and humectants that moisturize and leave skin dewy, it's also infused with a adenosine, niacinamide Complex that supports Whitening and wrinkles.\n\n**MISSHA First Treatment Essence Mist** rec'd by u/snailslimeandbeespit\n\nIngredients: Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Propanediol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Niacinamide, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Betaine, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Beta Vulgars (Beet) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Cornus Officinaus Fruit Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgars Extract, Cassia Alata Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Trethylehexanoin, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Peg-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Raffinose, Polyquaternium-51, Water (Aqua), Tromethamine, Lactobacillus Ferment, Adenosine, Ethylhexyglycerin, Acetic Acid, Lactic Acid, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**DIY Mist of Holy Snails Snowbang Essence** rec'd by u/snailslimeandbeespit (decanted into a fine mist sprayer)\n\nIngredients: Ingredients: Distilled Water, (Abronia Villosa Leaf Extract, Agave Americana Stem Extract, Blue Lotus Extract, Calendula Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomile Extract, Evening Primrose Root Extract, Fouqueria Splendens Stem Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Ginseng Extract, Goji Berry Extract, Green Tea Extract, Helichrysum Extract, Hibiscus Extract, Horse Chestnut Extract, Iris Florentina Extract, Licorice Root Extract, Mushroom Extract, Pumpkin Seed Extract, Opuntia Coccinellifera Flower Extract, Yucca Brevifolia Root Extract), Hydrolyzed Oats, (Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthum Gum), Glycerin, (Water, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Wasabi Root Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Garlic Bulb Extract), (Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methyparaben, Propylparaben), Disodium EDTA \n\n(Non-AB) **MARIO BADESCU Facial Spray With Aloe, Herb and Rosewater** rec'd by u/margotmargot11 and u/scaperoute\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water, Eau), Propylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Rosa Canina Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Leaf Extract, Fucus Vesiculosus Extract, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Parfum (Fragrance), Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Citronellol, Geraniol, CI 17200 (Red 33), CI 42090 (Blue 1).\n\n**Nature Republic Bee Venom Mist** rec'd by u/mamukizzy\n\nIngredients taken from NR site: Water, Macadamia ternifolia seed oil, glacier water, bee venom, honey extract, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, salicyclic acid, butylene glycol, citrus nobilis (mandarin orange) fruit extract, gardenia florida fruit extract, angelica archangelica leaf extract, houttuyniacordata extract, acoruscalamus root extract, foeniculumvulgare (fennel) fruit cindiumofficinale root extract, chamomillarecucita *matricaria) flower extract, viscum album (mistletoe) extract, camellia japonica flower extract, peg-60 hydrogenated castor oil, tocopheryl acetate, phenoxyethanol, 1,2-hexanediol, caprylyl glycol, tropolone, disodium edta, oleaeuropea (olive) furit oil, canangaodorata flower oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil, lavandulaangustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, pinussylvestris leaf oil (tea tree) leaf oil\n\n**A small note:** Please let me know if you want me to add websites and prices.

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

I did not see ANY change on my Hyperpigmentation whatsoever after finishing two and a half bottles. I use it in the morning after washing my face with the Faceshop rice cleansing foam, the Tonymoly Mochi toner, this serum, , the Tonymoly watermelon soothing moisturizer, and either the UV Doux or the Re'equil Blue sunscreen. \n\nThe texture of the product is good, like a very lightweight milky emulsion, lighter than the plum niacinamide 10% serum, it's fragrance free and did not break me out. I did notice a hydrating effect with this product, but that's it. For reference, the Minimalist anti- pigmentation active started showing results by the three weeks mark, so did The Ordinary AA serum(which I used almost two years ago). Also, I don't understand why the product description mentions 'plant derived arbutin' on FirstCry, my understanding was that arbutin is always plant-derived, I would be glad to know if there are any other sources of arbutin that I don't know of.\n\n\nSo, yes not going to buy this product again, and will go back to either the Minimalist or TO AA.\n\nPS. I so wish I could post this review under the \"Reviews\" flair, my first ever review on this sub was of the Vivah Goat Milk shampoo, and if this free for all thingy comes into effect permanently, this one might be my last review here. 😔",

        "body": "Interesting! I've been interested in Vilvah for a while now, because their susncreens have new age filters  (just ordered one of them 😆) so it seems there's some intentionality behind their products. \n\nThis serum sounds pretty nice. Their \"plant-derived thing\" is probably just to caater to the \"natural\" demographic of consumers 😑 Sucks, because they also kind of misrepresent their sunscreens as \"natural\" and talk about the benefits of mineral sunscreen... but their sunscreens are hybrid? 🙃 I wish they'd get their messaging clear, because the products seem promising.\n\nGotta say, though, I don't think any single-ingredient product for PIH will ever stack up against a product with multiple tyrosinase inhibitors like the 8% Anti-Pigmentation Actives 😅 Like, that's a high, high bar. And the approach to treating PIH effectively (fast, without irritation) is down to using multiple angles and ingredients that serve that purpose. I see a lot of people disappointed or impatient with their results from just an AA serum, for example.\n\nSince they discontinued the 8% actives, I've been using a combo of multiple products (at different times during the week) to get similar results. Kind of tangential to your review, OP, just something that occurred to me ☺️ Thanks so much for sharing! I learn so much from y'all, had no idea this product existed 😂❤️\n\nEdit: also, the product that Minimalist created to replace the 8% is available online, its the Minimalist P10 Advance Pigmentation Corrector Face Cream 👀 It's not fungal-safe, but maybe you'd be interested, OP",

    "body": "Dear members,\n\nI want to share here my experience with gastritis and what I all learned about it. It may benefit you or give you some insights, which can possibly a solution. I try my best to make the setup of this post as clear as possible. I'm a male, 28 years old. Struggled with bad digestion since I started fitness and incorporate lots of food and 'bodybuild' type of diet. A lot of dairy, shakes, grains, shakes with grinded rice to get my calories in. I abused my stomach. I always band aided the acid with rennies, but that was no cure. I had several gastroscopes. In 2016 i had Grade D inflammation in my esophagus. November last year I again had grade C inflammation and chronic gastritis. I was put on PPI, which in the first place relieved the pain, but I felt horrible on the PPI. I felt like an ill person, my body ached everywhere. That was the wake up call that I can not rely on medicines, since that's not the solution. I had to change everything that I structurally did, like my diet choices. I suffered from vomiting gastritis. When I eat, my stomach would fill up, bloat and give extreme GERD and indigestion. I puked 2-3 times daily, lost a lot of weight and felt like a cancer patient. Hope you're not insulted by how I name it, but that's how I literally felt.\n\n**What is gastritis in short?**\n\nGastritis is a chronic or acute inflammation of the stomach lining. Gastritis feels like a very sharp, burning pain in your stomach. Eating causes bloating, pain and discomfort. Doctors falsely believe that gastritis is caused by producing too much stomach acid, which is almost never the case, very rarely one makes too much stomach acid. If they do, they probably have Zollinger’s Syndrome. Other cases your stomach may make too much stomach acid, is when you eat (a lot of) processed foods, that are hard to digest. Your stomach produces extra acid to break down the hard digestible food.\n\n**What do doctors about gastritis?**\n\nDoctors are educated in a certain way. You have X problem and for X problem exist a pharmaceutical Z that ‘fixes’ your problem, but actually band aids it. In case of gastritis X stands for ‘yoUr sToMaCh pRoDucEs ToO mUcH aCid, and Z stands for: hEre’s a LiFe LoNg PrEsCrIptIoN foR PrOtOn PuMp InHiBitorS’.\n\n**What do proton pump inhibitors?**\n\nThey inhibit the proton pumps in your stomach to produce stomach acid. Sure sometimes it gives relieve, most of the times it doesn’t, since you are totally wrecking your digestion this way, making the problem even worse. PPI’s are also linked to many diseases when used long term and weaning off PPI’s is a living hell.\n\nSo what I have learned, if you have GERD and gastritis you need to go through this check list:\n\n1. **Which** **medications** are you currently using? Did your stomach problems occur when you started these medications? In my case, I was using bupropion for my ADD. It worked perfectly fine, but wrecked my digestion, gave me constant heart burn and reflux. I kind of ignored it and ban aided it with Rennies. Worst decision ever, because this lead to gastritis with intestinal metaplasia stage II.\n2. **How** **is** **your** **diet**? Gluten, lactose, dairy in general lead to slower gut motility, leading to longer transit times and slower gastric emptying. Also these foods are inflammatory, especially gluten. Some dairy, like quark or fat free yogurt, are easy to digest. All full fat dairy will in almost all cases cause upset stomach, slow digestion and heartburn / GERD, possibly leading to gastritis in the long run.\n3. Are you smoking? Quit smoking, very important.\n4. You checked the previous two point, they are in check\\*\\*. Still having lots of trouble\\*\\*. You possibly have hiatal hernia. A hiatal hernia is in some cases easily treated with massage techniques. Look for a chiropractor that is specialized in hiatal hernia massages. It really works. Keep in mind, when you have gastritis with vomiting as a symptom, you probably also have hiatal hernia, since the force upward the stomach and esophagus causes the stomach to get stuck into the diaphragm. I personally fixed it with massages myself and with a light hammer and a piece of a massage gun, with careful impact I replaced the stomach to its original place. I will post pictures of the device is use.\n5. **Still using PPI’s**? You will not recover, until you quit PPI’s.**How to wean off?**\n\n**Starting dose**: 40 mg pantoprazole (or any other)\n\n**Week** **1-3**: 20 mg pantoprazole. Catch possible rebound reflux with Rennies or famotidine 40 mg\n\n**Week 3-6:** 10 mg pantoprazole. Catch possible rebound reflux with Reenies and famotidine 40 mg. Might up the famotidine to 60 mg spread in two dosages.\n\n**Week 6-8**: Quit PPI and use famotidine 40 – 60 mg. Slowly taper the famotidine off according to your symptoms.\n\n**Important supplements** to use while weaning off PPI’s and in general for gastritis are slippery elm, aloe vera juice and bromelain.\n\n* Slippery elm 800 mg 1-3 times daily with 200 ml water. This will make some sort of coating to your esophagus and mostly for your stomach.\n* Aloe vera juice really kick started my healing process, for me personally a very important supplement. I used it daily 1-3 times 50-100 ml.\n* Bromelain is an anti inflammatory and digestive aid. It breaks down protein and improves gastric pH. I use 500-1000 mg, break the capsules open and dissolve in 200 ml water, before or after meal.\n* Digestive enzymes may also work for you. When you plan to eat a huge meal, when dining out for example, this may help you digest the food. Personally the bromelain only is enough for me.\n\n**Understanding gastritis**\n\nYou have to understand that gastritis is a disease triggered by an environmental stimuli (h. pylori excluded). Most gastritis cases are diet, mechanical (hiatal hernia) or medicine (for example bupropion or NSAIDs but many more medicine cause gastric upset) related or a combination of these factors together. If one factor still persists, you will keep having problems. If you diet is in check, you don't use any pharmaceuticals but still have hiatal hernia, then you will definitely still have problems. You can take as much antacids or PPI you want, you will keep getting GERD and your gastritis won't heal.  You need to find a diet that fits your body. What you eat until now did not work, hence the gastritis. We are grown up with a gluten and diary rich diet. All the inflammation and damage added up and caused gastritis. You need to rethink your diet.\n\nFor me personally I followed a typical bodybuilding diet from my 17th until 28th. Loads of whey isolate shakes, dairy and gluten. I abused my stomach by pouring down shakes with grinded rice powder several times a day to get my calories in. The final touch to get into full blown gastritis was the bupropion.\n\n**What foods do I eat now?**\n\nMy diet now is based on: Eggs, quark, fat free yogurt, gluten free oats, buckwheat, cream of rice, banana's, deshelled sunflower seeds, cashews, almonds, pea protein powder, steak/chicken breast, sweet potatoes, zucchini, blueberries, mango, broccoli, cauliflower.\n\nI'm not sure if I gave any new information with this post, but I personally learned a lot from this sub and I want to give something back from my findings with gastritis, because I was really hopeless to get ever healed, but I can tell I am. I am off PPI, I have a new diet and I quit the bupropion. I can recognize trigger foods and avoid them. I do regular hiatal hernia massages techniques and this way I am 100% free of issues. Sure I can not eat everything now. Everything that’s fried will possibly give me probably problems, but I anticipate that with bromelain and occasionally famotidine (when I drink alcohol for example). Occasionally I can 'cheat' and my stomach will handle that, but if I do that too often, I will wreck my digestion again and it will take days to settle.\n\nHere you can find the device I use to reverse the hiatal hernia. Apply with a light hammer slight impulse force. Try to do a vacuum and apply the force. Also try not to tense the abdomen but keep it relaxed. You may feel slight discomfort, since you are applying slight force to the stomach. I learned this from my chiropractor. You can also use a small sized (pet) tennis ball to do the same. On Youtube there are also videos about hiatal hernia massages, which also help. [https://ibb.co/SmvZB2D](https://ibb.co/SmvZB2D)\n\n**Final advice**\n\nFill a small medicine jar with antacids, famotidine, slippery elm and bromelain and carry it anywhere in your jacket or in the purse of your GF (that's why they have purses right \\*giggle\\*). There is nothing worse than being outside and having a gastritis attack and not have any meds with you. You have to control the damage.\n\n**Why control the damage?**\n\nEvery time your stomach lining gets attacked, you are one step closer to gastric intestinal metaplasia, which are stomach cells that are turned into cells that look like intestinal cells. This change of cells is seen as a sort of pre cancerous stage for stomach cancer. There are two steps later involved before your get cancer, which is dysplasia and then if I am correct, possibly cancer.\n\n**How can you reverse gastric intestinal metaplasia?**\n\nI am currently trying to reverse the metaplasia with my clean diet, high doses of vitamin c, high doses of serrapeptase, bromelain and papaya enzymes. These enzymes have proven anti cancer properties. If the gastritis is fully cured, you can probably reverse or at least stabilize the metaplasia and prevent it from progressing.\n\nHope it helps.\n\nGet well soon!",

Ease the pain with rennies and famotidine. Make sure to drink aloe vera juice regularly if you experience a lot of rebound acid. The aloe vera will heal the affected tissue. Slippery elm is also important. When weaning off, try to eat only bland foods that are super easy to digest. Don’t worry about weight loss or muscle gains if you are into fitness, that will come back later. Priority is to get off the PPI and restore your body’s function to how it needs to be.

Then food will stay too long in your stomach and cause GERD. Also the gas in your intestines from bacteria fermenting the food that stays too long in your digestive tract will cause burping and belching and the pressure from down below (your intestines) will push gas and food upwards to relieve pressure and cause LES to be weaker and so cause GERD.\n\nI am currently using 20 mg famotidine pre bed and 10 mg with break fast, because I am an outlier that makes too much stomach acid. My stomach hyper responds to food and makes too much acid. I suspect I have SIBO, since my GERD isn’t totally away and I still have weird food sensitivities I never had. I’m also often constipated, which I never had. All are sign of SIBO. For constipation I psylium husk capsules. I’m going to run a anti biotic cycle for SIBO and keep updated in a month.",

Help please!\n\nI use European sunscreen everyday because I read they are the best but I have so many questions on whether I am using them right. I will greatly appreciate any answers! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n* Should we be wearing gloves to apply sunscreens because that is how they are tested? How much deactivation happens when mixed with the natural oils and sweat on our hands or residue from hand sanitizers? I read that sunscreen testers use gloves when sunscreens are tested. I also read that sunscreens are very delicate and reactive and deactivate with even little changes. I notice every hand sanitizer leaves a residue and my favorite one has many ingredients such as Aloe Vera Juice, Glycerin and Fragrance. I have oily skin and the palms of my hands can get sweaty very fast and I don't always get a chance to wash my hands with soap and water before I reapply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Is it bad to use a metal spoon to measure quarter of a teaspoon? The measuring spoons I have are metal. I read somewhere that metals cause a negative reaction with sunscreen filters which deactivate them. The sunscreen is only in the spoon for a few minutes too so how much of a reaction would happen in the spoon for that short period of time? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  I also read that sunscreen is tested on the back and not the face. How do we know this doesn’t cause a difference in protection? I read that the skin on the body is different from the skin on the face. Apparently the back skin is thicker and less oily than on the face and the skin cells are larger. Are there companies that test on faces and not the back? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  I read that sunscreen has to be reapplied every two hours because the sweat and oils in our face with break it down and cause the filters to degrade. Does that mean it happens at the two hour mark or over time in two hours? For the best protection possible, does that mean we should try to reapply sunscreen before the two hour mark?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you wipe or cleanse your face before reapplying sunscreen? I try to reapply everyday at exactly the two hour mark but notice by the second or third time the leftover residue from the morning is still on the face. The residue grows as the day goes by with more reapplications and it is very uncomfortable by night time. Sometimes the residue collects at the edges of my face like a gunk that sometimes forms crumbles that fall off or get caught in my hair.",

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

        "body": "Honestly just a year ago I would slap anything on my face but like I mention in the post beauty boxes pushed me to research the crap skincare items I was sent. \n\nIf you want to learn more about a certain product I recommend using https://incidecoder.com, it will show you the functions of all the ingredients in a skincare product (emulsifier, antioxidant, sunscreen filter etc) if you wish to learn more about a certain ingredient just click on it and most of them will have a dedicated page to one ingredient with a lot more info and they always cite their sources.  \n\nHowever a lot of times there isn’t information on new ingredients or botanical extracts (it happens a lot with K beauty skincare), I’m guessing because not many people do clinical studies on these ingredients. At that point you just have to google and dig deep into the rabbit hole, always question the claims/studies made by the manufacturer of a ingredient, like bioNymph peptide, which is its patented name.  But it’s Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, thus far I feel like I can’t trust any of the information that’s been made about this ingredient since there are no research confirming it, it’s also at the very end of the ingredients list which means the ingredients are all in VERY low % like 0.001% (not the actual % just an example), also the Magic Cream claims to have vitamin c (Ascorbic acid) but again it’s at the end of the list and Ascorbic acid works best at 5 - 15%.  \n\nGeneral rule is that the top 5/6  ingredients make up around 80% of the product so if a product claims to have a certain ingredient then it should be the first few ingredients you see on the list (Fresh’s Lotus Moisturizers has almost no lotus extract in them).  Here are a few tips to make the guessing game easier, by law if a product contains more than 0.75% of salicylic acid they must disclose the % so if certain exfoliating products say they contain salicylic acid but doesn’t say the % then you know it’s less than 0.75%, or if the percentage of SA is on the label, say 1%, then you every ingredient after SA is less than 1%.  Phenoxyethanol one of the most commonly seen preservatives can be used UP TO 1% in a product, they don’t always use that much.  However if you see this near the top of long ingredients list then it’s a good chance there’s probably around 1% of it in the formula and all the ingredients that comes afterwards are below 1%.  \n\nHowever if the ingredients are “actives” which are ingredients that address and target certain skin concerns, and they’ve been scientifically proven to have the desired effect, such as retinol, vitamin c, chemical acids, certain antioxidants, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide etc.  Then it’s important to know roughly the concentration of these ingredients in a product.  Certain actives work best at the right percentages anything higher would just cause irritation for sensitive skin anything lower won’t have the desired effect.  The studies that showed the amazing skin brightening properties of niacinamide used only 2% of it.  \n\nOn those subjects I recommend checking out LabMuffin a skincare blogger and YouTuber with a PhD (or was it a Master’s) in chemistry and she breaks down the chemistry behind skincare ingredients/formulation and makes it easy to understand.  Here a link to her helpful free acid calculator: https://labmuffin.com/free-acid-calculator-for-exfoliants-at-specific-ph-levels, all you need are the type of acid, pH level of product and the percentage of acids that’s on the label to figure the free acid value (the % that will actually be useful).  I would recommend watching her videos and read her blog post.  Next I watch a few dermatologist on YouTube, first is Dr. Dray her approach to skincare is very scientific, cautious (she discourages the use of scented products) and simple as in there’s no need for a 12 step routine or $200 moisturizers, its easy to see from her recommendations/routine.  Next I watch Dr. Shereene Idriss, another great source of information but she’s different in that she’ll use scented products and expensive products with pretty packaging (more like me haha), but she’s still a dermatologist so she knows her stuff.  \n\nTL:DR - checkout LabMuffin skincare YouTuber/blogger with PhD in chemistry.  Watch some YouTube channels by dermatologist, Dr. Dray and Dr. Shereene Idriss, there’s actually more dermatologist with YouTube channels.",

Website says the flavour is supposed to be natural pear flavour.  I ran 24 ounces and dropped in 3 level spoons.  It dissolved well with no grit left in the bottom of the cup.\n\nThe flavour reminds me of a bit of aloe vera juice with Asian pear tartness and the taste of candy pear on the aftertaste mixed with ramune.  It's pretty complex.  It leans into being candy pear (really reminds me of \"Juicy Pear\" jelly belly jellybeans) and has a pleasant tartness that really does remind me of \"snow\" pears (Asian pears).\n\nI'd say this is an outstanding flavour because it's not too strong and has a good balance of sour and sweet.",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants.

I agree with a lot of what you said, but generalising everyone who wears daily SPF by calling them obsessive is taking it too far (don't you agree?). That's like saying everyone who tries to eat healhy has an eating disorder. As long as it doesn't gets out of hand, it's perfectly fine. And I can't change my genetics, and I'm not your super good looking mom, so of course I'll do what I can by controlling the environmental factors of my life: like eating vegetables, exercising, not smoking, and not exposing my skin to too many carcinogenic UV rays. But, yeah, we both agree that it's important to not worry about aging (it's inevitable) or to develop a obsessive relationship with sunscreen, and not having a sun-phobia. :-)",

        "body": "Of course we will all age, and that's perfectly okay. That's why I wrote extrinsic skin aging -- not just skin aging. Extrinsic means the aging caused by environmental factors from the outside. If you look at older people with really dark skin, you can clearly see that they have much healhier-looking skin than their pale counterparts. And that's because their melanin worked as a UV filter for their entire life. (Note that every skin tone can develop skin cancer.) And that's what I want: to grow older with healthy skin. UV rays also causes skin cancer, and I already have many moles for someone my age, and I live in a country with some of the highest skin cancer rates in the world. \n\nWhen it comes to vitamin D, there aren't actually any studies that show that wearing sunscreen in practice leads to vitamin D deficiency. This is because you only need a small patch of skin exposed to UVB for a few minutes (10-15) for your body to produce enough vitamin D for the day, and then it'll actually stop producing more. If you are low in vitamin D your body will also produce vitamin D faster than normal, so skin tone isn't the only indication of how fast someone synthesise vitamin D. If you look at inuit peoples, they have somewhat darker skin than norther Europeans, but they never suffered from Vitamin D deficiency historically, and that's because their diet was really rich in Vitamin D. Australians, on the other hand, experience vitamin D deficiency same as everyone else, despite many Australians being of European descent and living in a country with some of the strongest UVB rays on the planet. Either way, you can get Vitamin D from your diet or a supplement, or a few minutes of UVB exposure a day. It's up to you. Talk with your doctor if you're worried about being deficient.\n\nThe vampire statement was me trying to be funny. I'm sorry if my joke was so easily misunderstood. Studies show that being outdoorsy and active is really good for you -- no surprise there. And if I actually lived as a vampire, I wouldn't need to buy any sunscreen. And I love garlic, thanks. And you're totally right that it's important to not be too obsessive about aging and sunscreen use. If I'm really busy and I forget to put on sunscreen it doesn't bother me, the same way forgetting to brush my teeth doesn't cause emotional anguish.\n\nAlso remember that this is SKincareAddiction, and many people take sunscreen pretty seriously around here. \n\nxx",

        "body": "I've been through almost three 100ml bottles of EVY, and you've seen how many different sunscreens I've tried at this point, so I definitely like it. It can be a little bit sticky if you overapply it, but it's not the same stickiness that I experience with other sunscreens, because the film isn't disturbed, and the sunscreen doesn't come off. It's difficult to explain, but it feels more like your skin is very hydrated, and you can tell that it has absorbed into your skin, not just sitting on top. But at the end of the day, cosmetic elegance is very biased, different strokes for different folks and all that. At least I can assure you that the EVY has perfect UV coverage and that's it's very water resistant.\n\nI think the big difference between European and Asian sunscreens, is that European sunscreens are developed for the holidays and the beach, while Asian sunscreens are developed for everyday usage, and thus are not as water resistant, but also way more elegant. Alcohol in sunscreens doesn't bother, thankfully. There is also a lot of alcohol in a lot of Asian sunscreens, so be careful. And I want to try the Klairs one some day :-D",

You can't see it, though, and you can only feel it when you're touching your skin. It's like a very thick primer, almost. It definitely works (no burn, no tan), and to date it's been the quickest sunscreen to apply and a bottle lasts a lifetime. I would personally buy the SPF 50+ version, since I'm a little bit sceptical how this formulation would work as a BB cream. Please write a review if you buy either one, though! :-D",

A higher SPF also requires higher UVA protection, since the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF (UVB protection) according to EU standards. So that's also a great reason why you should always buy the highest SPF available when in Europe. I'd try buying the SPF 50 or Kids SPF 50, if I were you. :-) If you don't like either of them on your face (which I doubt will happen), it's still a great body sunscreen.

    "body": "This is my story of reclaiming my life from the grips of chronic acid reflux (GERD). It's not just about managing symptoms – it's about understanding my body and making peace with my digestive system.\n\nFor years, I lived in fear of food. Every meal felt like a gamble. Would this be the one that sends me into a spiral of heartburn, regurgitation, and that terrible burning sensation in my chest? I'd wake up coughing in the middle of the night, my throat raw from stomach acid. Simple pleasures like coffee with friends or enjoying a family dinner became sources of anxiety.\n\nThe turning point wasn't finding the perfect medication (though those helped). It was realizing that my digestive system wasn't my enemy – it was sending me important messages that I needed to learn to understand.\n\nThe first breakthrough came when I started treating my esophagus as a sensitive friend rather than a broken machine. Instead of just popping antacids and hoping for the best, I began paying attention to patterns. Which foods triggered symptoms? What times of day were worst? How did stress affect my digestion?\n\nI discovered that my reflux wasn't just about what I ate – it was about how I ate. Rushing through meals during lunch breaks, eating large portions late at night, and stress-eating while working were all contributing to my symptoms. My body wasn't malfunctioning; it was begging me to slow down.\n\nMeal timing became my secret weapon. Rather than three large meals, I switched to smaller, more frequent portions that didn't put as much pressure on my lower esophageal sphincter. I learned to eat dinner at least three hours before bed, giving my stomach time to empty before lying down.\n\nPosture played a surprisingly important role. Simply sitting up straight during meals and avoiding slouching at my desk made a noticeable difference. I started taking short walks after meals instead of immediately returning to work or collapsing on the couch.\n\nThe hardest part? Saying goodbye to some of my favorite foods. Tomato-based sauces, citrus fruits, chocolate, and my beloved morning coffee were major triggers. But instead of viewing this as deprivation, I turned it into an adventure of finding new favorites. I discovered the joy of herbal teas, learned to make creamy non-acidic sauces, and found ways to add flavor without aggravating my symptoms.\n\nSleep became a crucial focus. Elevating the head of my bed (not just using extra pillows) made a dramatic difference in my nighttime symptoms. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine helped reduce stress-related acid production.\n\nSpeaking of stress – it was perhaps the biggest revelation. During particularly stressful periods, my symptoms would flare regardless of what I ate. This led me to explore stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and gentle yoga. These practices didn't just help my reflux; they improved my overall quality of life.\n\nBuilding a supportive medical team was essential. Finding a doctor who listened to my concerns and worked with me to find the right combination of lifestyle changes and medications made all the difference. We discovered that my reflux was worse during certain times of the month, allowing me to anticipate and prepare for challenging periods.\n\nI learned to assemble a toolkit for flare-ups: loose, comfortable clothing, natural remedies like ginger tea and aloe vera juice, breathing exercises, and positioning techniques. Having these tools ready helped reduce the anxiety around potential symptoms.\n\nThe most unexpected lesson? How interconnected our digestive health is with our emotional well-being. As I learned to listen to my body's signals and respond with compassion rather than frustration, both my symptoms and my stress levels improved.\n\nTo anyone struggling with GERD – know that you're not alone. This condition can be isolating and frustrating, but there is hope. Your journey might look different from mine, but healing is possible. It's not just about finding the right medications or eliminating trigger foods; it's about creating a lifestyle that supports your digestive health.\n\nTake it one day at a time. Celebrate small victories. Be patient with yourself as you learn your triggers and find your balance. Your body isn't fighting against you – it's trying to communicate with you.\n\nRemember, managing acid reflux is a journey, not a destination.

Introduce 1 Cup a day, don’t go overboard like me. \n\n[Here](https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health/aloe-vera-juice-for-ibs) is some information for those who would like more, or feel free to do your own research. \n\n——\nWhen I tell you, I’ve been drinking [this](https://a.co/d/igqNMxh) like WATER and couldn’t understand how I had been to the bathroom three times this morning. The typical symptoms I am used to experiencing BEFORE a bowel movement, were not my normal symptoms. I had no ill pain, or struggle to strain. TMI, but for the first time in a month or two, they were not “rocks and/or pellets.” It was a normal, “No. 2”— all three times. \n\nI love Aloe Vera Juice. It was one of the drinks besides Canada Dry I switched to that I felt was safe for my IBS-C symptoms because many of the other juices, such as Apple Juice, was high fiber. And anything high fiber causes me extreme pain. So for the last three months, I have switched to drink Aloe Juice every now and then. I had noticed that I’d get a weird stomach gurgle but assumed it was something I had ate at the time, which highly-likely, it was. \n\nBut for the first time, I decided to do some research because for the last two days, I have drank over 16 ounces of Aloe Juice, and decided to drink some today on an empty stomach, once again— drinking it like it’s water; and discovered that it does not only aid in constipation, but it’s classified as a “Laxative” due to the aloin, which is a substance that acts as a laxative. \n\nAlthough I will need to cut back on my Aloe Juice consumptions, I at least am grateful discover something that doesn’t feel like a lot of pressure on my intestines and bowels, and that aids in a very smooth and less painful bowel movement.\n\nThought I would give this as a suggestion for anyone who is looking to try something a little more natural such as this.

    "body": "I've noticed that it’s hard to find simple, hopeful stories—ones that don’t get lost in all the details about the “when,” “how,” or “how long” it took. Sometimes, those details can be overwhelming, especially when all we really need is hope.\n\nI wanted to create a space where we can just focus on success stories, for those of us who need a bit of light on the tough days when the symptoms feel unbearable, and it seems like we’ll never get better. But the truth is, we *will*.\n\nHere are three real-life examples of people who healed from gastritis:\n\n**1. Jordan Rubin – Overcame Gastritis and Crohn's Disease**\n\nJordan Rubin, founder of the supplement company Garden of Life, was diagnosed with a severe case of gastritis and Crohn's disease in his early 20s. He experienced debilitating symptoms, including severe inflammation of the stomach lining, chronic pain, and digestive issues. Jordan tried various treatments, but nothing worked until he adopted a diet rich in fermented foods, bone broth, and organic, whole foods. His holistic approach included probiotics, digestive enzymes, and supplements to heal his gut. After following this regimen, Jordan was able to fully recover and regain his health. His story is outlined in his book *The Maker's Diet*.\n\n**2. Adele – Healed from Gastritis with Diet and Lifestyle Changes**\n\nAdele, a blogger who shares her journey online, struggled with chronic gastritis that left her in pain after meals and with constant nausea. She initially tried conventional medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), but they offered only temporary relief. Adele switched to a strict anti-inflammatory diet, cutting out caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, and processed sugars. She incorporated natural remedies like Slippery Elm, marshmallow root, and licorice root (DGL) while also focusing on stress reduction through yoga and meditation. Over time, these changes allowed her to heal from her gastritis symptoms completely.\n\n**3. James – Healed from Chronic Gastritis through a Holistic Approach**\n\nJames, a fitness enthusiast, experienced severe chronic gastritis due to a combination of stress, poor diet, and overuse of NSAIDs. After dealing with constant burning pain, nausea, and fatigue, he decided to take a holistic approach. He eliminated trigger foods like spicy, acidic, and fried foods, and began eating smaller, more frequent meals. James also supplemented his diet with aloe vera juice, probiotics, and L-glutamine to promote gut healing. After several months of these changes, along with practicing mindfulness to reduce stress, he was able to fully heal his stomach and return to his normal activities without any symptoms.\n\nThese examples show that with dietary adjustments, natural supplements, and stress management, many people have successfully healed from gastritis.\n\n**4. Kayla – Overcame Gastritis with a Low-Acid Diet and Natural Remedies**\n\nKayla, who shared her journey on social media, suffered from severe gastritis that caused burning stomach pain and acid reflux. After trying conventional medications with limited success, she decided to switch to a low-acid, anti-inflammatory diet. She eliminated common irritants like coffee, tomatoes, citrus fruits, and fried foods. Kayla also introduced natural remedies like Slippery Elm, aloe vera juice, and chamomile tea, which helped soothe her stomach lining. Along with small, frequent meals and stress reduction techniques, Kayla was able to completely heal from her gastritis within a few months and now helps others through her blog.\n\n**5. Mark – Healed from Stress-Induced Gastritis with Mindfulness and Diet**\n\nMark, a corporate professional, developed stress-induced gastritis after years of working in a high-pressure environment. His symptoms included stomach pain, bloating, and nausea. Realizing that stress played a major role in his condition, Mark made changes to both his diet and lifestyle. He cut out processed foods, alcohol, and caffeine, focusing on a whole-food diet rich in lean proteins, vegetables, and healing broths. He also began practicing mindfulness meditation and yoga to manage stress. By addressing both his physical and emotional health, Mark healed from gastritis in about six months and has remained symptom-free.\n\n**6. Emily – Recovered from Severe Gastritis After Eliminating Food Sensitivities**\n\nEmily struggled with chronic gastritis for years, experiencing severe pain, nausea, and indigestion. After trying medications without long-term success, she visited a functional medicine practitioner who suggested that food sensitivities might be contributing to her condition. Emily underwent an elimination diet and discovered she was sensitive to gluten, dairy, and spicy foods. Once she removed these trigger foods from her diet, her symptoms began to improve. She also used digestive supplements like L-glutamine and zinc carnosine to support her gut lining. Within a few months, Emily's gastritis was completely healed, and she now follows a personalized diet that keeps her symptom-free.\n\nThese stories  demonstrate that by identifying triggers, making dietary changes, and adopting natural remedies, many individuals have been able to HEAL from chronic gastritis.\n\nStay strong!",

        "body": "Hi there, yes you are right, the formulas are different in terms of filters. For the Invisible Spray we have, in order of appearance: Tinosorb S, Uvinul T 150, Avobenzone, Diisopropyl Sebacate (booster) and then finally Mexoryl 400, Uvinul A plus, Mexoryl XL, and Ensulizole (plus hydroxyacetophenone which sould act as antioxidant and antinflamatory for skin and sunscreen both). \nNow, the consistency is light for being such a heavy duty sunscreen, water resistant and with so many filters, but it is shiny to the extreme! It feels like a liquid cream, with a sort of whipped texture, if that makes sense. Unfortunately the effect is like a glazed doughnut and if used in the right amount (1/4 teaspoon, 6 full spray for face only) it doesn't properly dry out, which makes difficult to apply a powder on top and will make pollution stick to it, especially with second application and so forth.  I use it with a silicon primer lightly tapped on it and it becomes 80% matte with no effort. Using a mattifying cream underneath is a good solution too, but I haven't tried this option yet.  I tried different methods of application and the best one for me is to apply in two layers (spreading and massaging 3 sprays on skin, then wait 20 min and procede with orher 3 sprays), in this way the result is less shiny and it absorbs better. In terms of filters it appears, judging by the position in inci, that the Invisible Spray has indeed more Mexoryl 400 in it, compared to the Pediatric UVmune Lotion ( fifth place in inci for the Spray,  seventh place in inci for the Lotion) but I don't know if this rule applies to sunscreen formulations, by logic it should, but maybe the same percentage was used and they were just formulated differently? I guess we should ask La Roche Posay, I am very curious about it too.  \nPersonally, I prefer the Lotion. It is so light in consistency for being such a heavy, water resistant and hydrating sunscreen, it is like a milk, and it dissolves and blends very quickly (even more so then the LRP Uvmune 400 Hydrating Cream Spf 50+ or the Oil Control Gel Cream Spf 50+). In terms of shine, it is indeed very shiny, just a tad bit more shiny then the Hydrating Cream, but it is a different kind of shiny in respect to the Spray. With the Spray I look oily and glazed, like a mirror, with the Lotion I look glowy at first application and then just heavily shiny with second and so forth application. Working with it in 2 layers is best for the Lotion also, but patting or one quick application works too. \nThe Lotion filters are, in order of appearance: Avobenzone, Uvinol T 150, Tinosorb S, Ensulizole, Diisopropyl Sebacate (booster), Uvinul A Plus, then Mexoryl 400, Mexoryl XL and Mexoryl XS. \nIf you have oily skin or you don't like heavy sunscreens, then I would stay away from both Spray & Lotion, but for dry to normal skin, I still belive those are great options, and will save you tons of money. They are excellent sunscreens to use when at home or doing sport. \n\n\nI am in the process of trying another product with Mexoryl 400, the L'Oreal Bright Reveal SPF 50 Cream, which is presented in a jar. It is not water resistant nor does it have the Net Lock technology, but it should be light and perfect for staying at home! The filters are, in order of appearance: Tinosorb S, Uvinul T 150, Mexoryl 400, Avobenzone, Mexoryl XL, Diisopropil Sebacate. In terms of skin benefits it has 2% niacinamide in the formula, a very good antioxidant which is the Phenylethyl Resorcinol, plus Vit E. It also contains fatty acids, emolients and glycerin, although the few reviews I have read said it is very light and not so shiny as the LRP sunscreens. Also, it has a light rosy color, so no white or yellow cast (as it is often with the Mexoryl400 products).  It comes in 50ml for as low as 11,00€ or as high as 25,00€, so no saving money here, but it could be a good replacement for the LRP Uvmune 400 products, if those are too shiny for you. \nFor the moment it appears the best LRP UVmune 400 semi matte sunscreen is still the Face Oil Control Gel Cream, followed by the Oil Control Fluid ( more so their colored versions, although unfortunately they contain fragrance and have an orange color). \n\n\nEdit: edit some typing mistakes.",

    "body": "Chelating agents are chemical compounds that react with metal ions to form a stable complex. They help to bind up these metal ions contaminants to keep the product microbe free for longer shelf life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMetal ions without a chelating agent are most likely to cause problems in DIY formulas, including:\n\n* Spoilage and rancidity\n* Degradation of vitamins and essential fatty acids\n* Fragrance/essential oil degradation\n* Discoloration\n* Cloudy formation and precipitation\n* Poor foaming and rinsability performance\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's essential to use a chelating agent if your DIY formula contains: \n\n* Botanical extracts/powders \n* Aloe vera juice/gel/powder \n* Hydrosols/floral waters/distillates/essences \n* Proteins (e.g. hydrolyzed oat and rice protein)\n* Honey and its derivatives (e.g. honeyquat and royal jelly) \n* Herbal/fruit powders\n* Clay\n* Thickening agents (e.g. starches and glucose)\n* Unrefined/unfiltered waxes (e.g. beeswax and flower waxes)\n* Lecithin\n\n# EDTA:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEthylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a molecule which complexes metal ions in aqueous environments. It is available in four neutralizations, two of which, disodium EDTA and tetrasodium EDTA are commonly used in the cosmetics. The choice of which product to use is determined by the intended pH of your product.\n\nDisodium EDTA is commonly used in neutral to mildly acidic products, such as toners, serums, creams, and neutral pH cleansers. Tetrasodium EDTA is recommended for alkaline products, like cleansers and shampoos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecommend usage rates:\n\n* Disodium EDTA = 0.1%-0.3%\n* Tetrasodium EDTA = 0.1%\n\n# Other chelators:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease keep in mind that disodium EDTA is a strong chelating agent than any of these chelators. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGlucono Delta Lactone is a polyhydroxy acid, the next generation of alpha hydroxy acid. It is recommended for acidic formulas. When it is dissolved in water, it will slowly hydrolyze to gluconic acid which produces gentle acidification in the same way as lactic acid-producing bacteria. It has several benefits: moisturizing and hydrating effects, may even smooth skin texture, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSodium phytate is an alternative of disodium EDTA and tetrasodium EDTA. It is the sodium salt of phytic acid and a natural substance found in plant seeds. It can be used in acidic and alkaline formulas. It has additional benefits: moisturizes skin, improves skin elasticity, normalizes oily skin, may help reduce pore size, helps lighten skin, and may help improve the appearance of cellulite. It has a pH of 12 - may need to adjust the pH's formula to bring it down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCitric acid is widely used in cosmetics to adjust pH in formulations, has mild chelating properties, and is also used as an antioxidant to improve the effects of other antioxidants. Citric acid is intended for acidic formulas only.  This shouldn't be the first choice for chelating agent especially if your DIY formula has too many botanical extracts or a high percentage of aloe vera/hydrosol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecommended usage rates:\n\n* Glucono Delta Lactone: 0.1%-1%\n* Sodium phytate: 0.1%-0.5%\n* Citric acid: 0.1%-1%",

    "body": "I was on the search for the perfect fragrance free oil/balm cleanser for quite some time. I love to do double cleanse to make sure I remove all the sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of first cleansers/cleansing balms so I thought I would do a quick review here for anyone who is interested. My standards when it comes to a good cleansing balm/oil: fragrance-free, effective, but gentle on the skin, doesn’t over-dry the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone.\n\nAll the products I buy and review here completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing, potentially irritating plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus). So here we go:\n\n**Versed Gentle Cycle Hydrating Milky Cleanser:**  **•**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water/Aqua/EauOlea Europaea (Olive) Fruit OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed OilPropanediolVitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed OilGlycerinCaprylic/Capric TriglycerideMusa Sapientum (Banana) ExtractMagnesium Aluminum SilicateLactobacillus Ferment LysateSclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed OilAvena Sativa (Oat) Kernel ExtractRubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit ExtractLeuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment FiltrateTocopherolCitric AcidSodium Lauroyl SarcosinateXanthan GumEthylhexylglycerinSodium BenzoatePotassium SorbateSodium Hydroxide\n\n**My thought:** This product has a milky texture that is easy to use, effective and also gentle on the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes, but there are a few things to note: 1/ It doesn’t spread very far on the skin so you have to use quite a lot of product to cover the entire face so the bottle doesn’t last very long. 2/Even though the product is fragrance free, there’s a light banana scent due to the banana extract in the formula. So if you’re not fond of the banana smell, you might not like it.  Overall, it’s a great , gentle formula and one that I might repurchase.\n\n**Updated review (11/10/22): I recently repurchased this product again and noticed there are little grainy particles like sand in the product. I'm not sure what they did to the product but my sensitive skin can't tolerate scrubs or any physical exfoliant so I won't be using or repurchase this product again.**\n\n**Good Molecule Instant Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polyethylene, PEG-8 Isostearate, 1,2-hexanediol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Citric Acid.\n\n**My thought:** This product used to be only available in the scented version (loaded with potentially irritating essential oils), but due to customer demand, they decided to make a fragrance free version (thank you very much). I’m not sure if the scented version is still out there, so make sure you check the ingredients carefully before purchasing. This product come in a tub with a small spatula that you can use to scoop up the product. I do like this cleansing balm, I think it’s very effective and a little goes a long way. You don’t need to use much to cleanse the entire face. It’s also gentle enough to use around my eyes without any irritation. One con I can think of about this product is the smell. Even though it’s fragrance free, it has a chemical smell that is quite strong which I guess comes from one of the raw ingredients in the formula (though I’m not sure which one exactly). I think some people might find it unpleasant, but it’s still better than adding fragrance or essential oils.\n\n**The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Laurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**My thought:** This product has a cream texture that is quite thick coming out of the tube, and once it’s on the skin, it does require a lot of massaging, then the texture changes to oil as you work it in. Even though it’s gentle on the skin, I find it a lot less effective than other products on this list. This is not a product I would recommend for someone that wears a lot of makeup or doesn’t like to take a long time removing makeup at the end of the day. Even if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, I think there are better products out there. Personally, I wouldn’t repurchase it because: 1/It requires too much rubbing and effort to make it work. 2/I find it does irritate my eyes a little. 3/you have to use a lot of product to cleanse the entire face and the tube doesn’t last very long.\n\n**The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n**My thought:** This product comes in a tube, similar to the packaging of the ordinary squalene cleanser, but the texture is different. It comes out of the tube like petrolatum jelly. Because it’s quite thick, it doesn’t spread very far, so you have to use quite a lot of product to cleanse the entire face. It’s gentle on the skin and eyes, and leave my skin very soft afterward, but I think it will not work well for someone that wear a lot of makeup. I consider myself a minimal makeup wearer and this product couldn’t remove my eyeshadow completely. I also notice that the texture of the cleanser is not completely smooth, it’s slightly grainy due to the small pieces of oat which I do not like. I will not be repurchasing this product.\n\n**Jordan Samuel Skin The After Show Treatment Cleanser for Sensitive Skin:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Aqua/Water, Sucrose Laurate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobiliss Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**My thought:** This has to be the worse balm cleanser I have ever tried. It has a jelly-like texture coming out of the tube, and it goes on the skin just fine, but it just doesn’t cleanse off when I rinse my face with water. It barely remove makeup and leaves my face with a layer of residue that feels oily. I feel like I have to follow up with another cleanser right away or risk breaking out. I hate wasting product but I couldn’t make myself use this one so I threw it out after trying a few times. Sadly, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbeth-30 Tetraisostearate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olive Fruit Oil, Water, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate (Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), Jojoba Seed Oil, Ceresin, Dextrin Palmitate/Ethylhexanoate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, BHT\n\n**My thought:** this product is a very popular Japanese cleansing oil, and for a good reason. It’s affordable, cleanses quickly and effectively, without leaving any residue behind. 2 pumps are what needed to cleanse my entire face. If you’re someone that wear a lot of makeup and need something that can remove make up fast and effortlessly, you will love this product. Some cons about this product: 1/ it can bother my eyes sometimes if I get it too close to the eyes. I thought i just throw this out there in case anyone has super sensitive eyes. 2/ It might be hard to get in in store. You have to order it online and it might take some time to arrive.\n\n**Isnt Tree Micellar Melting Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Sap , Opuntia Ficus-Indica Seed Oil , Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Squalane\n\n**My thought:** This is a liquidy cleansing oil that comes in a pump bottle. It’s thin in texture and gentle, but effective. It’s also non irritating to the eyes, and rinses off well. Compare to the hada labo, it’s a thinner oil, and I have to use more product than Hada Labo to cleanse my entire face. I need 3 pumps for Isnt Tree as opposed to only 2 pumps for Hada Labo. If you are deciding between the 2, I would recommend Hada Labo. It’s just as effective if not more, the bottle lasts longer, and more cost effective as well.\n\n**Purito from Green Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Vegetable Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**My thought:** This oil cleanser come in a pump bottle similar to the ones from Hada Labo and Isnt Tree, but the texture is thicker than the other 2 brands. It’s effective, but gentle and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I need about 3 pumps to cleanse my entire face. Overall, it’s a good cleanser but I still prefer the Hada Labo because it’s cheaper, works just as well, and the bottle lasts longer.\n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient solvent), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate (emollient cleansing agent), Diisooctyl Succinate (emollient), Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters (emollient cleansing agent/emulsifier), Trihydroxystearin (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (emulsifier), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant).\n\n**My thought:** This one has a balm like texture coming out of the tube and spread easily on the skin. There’s no residue left behind after cleansing. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn’t sting my eyes and is also effective. It has no discernible smell, which is nice since some fragrance-free products can still have an unpleasant smell due to the raw ingredients used in the formula.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-10 Isostearate, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Seed Water, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Water, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**My thought:** This is the most recent product that I've tried and is my current favorite. If I have to choose only 1 balm/oil cleanser to use, this would be the one. It replaces my previous favorite cleansing balm from Paula's Choice. The texture is smooth and gentle on the skin. It spreads more easily than Paula's Choice's and has no detectable scent. \n\n**Other plain oil options I’ve tried that work well:** When I run out of my balm cleanser and haven’t purchased a replacement in time. I usually use plain oils to remove my makeup. But because plain oils do not contain emulsifier, they don’t come off with water, so I have to immediately follow up with a water based cleanser to rinse off the oil residue on my face. Here are 2 oils that I like to use:\n\n**Coconut oil**: thicker oil, best for people with normal to dry skin\n\n**Jojoba Oil:** thinner in texture than coconut oil, best for oily and combo skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Top 3:** \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser**\n\nIf you have a favorite oil/balm cleansers that are not on this list, please share with me in the comment :)\n\n&#x200B;",

I'm definitely going to keep these in mind for reccing balms in the future since I don't usually mess with those.\n\nFor context, I'm dry skin and sensitive + acne prone, plus have keratosis pilaris. A cleansing oil I would highly suggest to try out is\n\nKOSE SPEEDY cleansing oil. Here is the current ingredient list https://incidecoder.com/products/kose-speedy-cleansing-oil\n\n you'll see a lot of different listings since they reformulated a lot but this is the right one. \nIt is a very light, well emulsified oil that rinses cleanly and doesn't overstrip. Spreads very well. Doesn't leave a residue. It is even good as a solo cleanse! This is my default recc for any skin type or with any condition. I have people with rosacea, eczema, and ichthyosis using it so I'm very confident in its gentleness. In the US, there's 1pack 7.8oz for $13 or 2pack with 1 full and 1 refill for $20 on Amazon. Some have mentioned being able to find it at Daiso stores in US and other countries. \n\nSo this second one I've only used for a week but I begrudgingly have been pretty into it as I'm more on the dry side. It's the Neutrogena lightweight body oil fragrance-free https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/body-oil-fragrance-free/6861830.html\n\nIt's a very low-viscosity watery-freling oil and it has good spreadability. Works really well at getting into pore for that deep but gentle clean you want from oils. It's probably the gentlest one I've tried even more so than my DIY sunflower/grapeseed + Polysorbate 80 I've made. The \"problem\" is that the Neutrogena oil does not rinse well at all. However I think it might good alternative for people who have tried other oil cleanser and found the emulsifiers just made it too much for their skin but don't want to use a pure oil. It does mostly come off with the gentle second cleanse. It will leave a bit behind in your skin, but as someone dry I quite appreciate that slight buffer for the cleanser and it hasn't caused any issues or broken me out. My skin does actually feel quite a bit more comfortable and less dry since introducing this when this was the only change. It does feel decently nourishing without being overwhelming. It definitrly lives up to its claims if used this way. Normal price is $13 for 8.5oz but can be found for $9-10 on sale sometimes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but my skin has already decided it likes this, so... 😒\n\nAs my gentle water-based cleanser, my current favorite is the Pipette baby wash and shampoo fragrance-free https://www.target.com/p/pipette-baby-shampoo-wash-fragrance-free-11-8-fl-oz/-/A-79503241. I get a lot of funny looks when I recc this but it's genuinely the best thing I've found that is on par in gentleness with some of the better non-foaming cleansers like the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser and is more affordable. It has amazing spreadability and you don't need a lot. I have gone through 4 bottles and am about to repurchase because I'm too hooked and it's insanely cost effective compared to most facial cleansers. Normal price is $8 for 12oz, it's commonly on sale for $6.50ish and one time I caught it for $4 so I stocked up hard. But I'd be happy paying $8. I also use it for body and hair so 😳 I felt it was worth mentioning since it's the second cleanse I follow with.\n\nI'm definitely gonna be taking a look at more of your content now as well!

    "body": "[The Tobacco Throwdown Rd 5 - Ariana &  Evans Vanille de Tabac](http://imgur.com/gallery/1kpsj8D)\n\n\n\n\n* **Brush:** Dogwood Hybrid\n\n\n* **Razor:** Charcoal Tech\n\n\n* **Blade:** GSB\n\n\n* **Lather:** Ariana & Evans Vanille de Tabac\n\n\n* **Post:** A&E Vanille de Tabac\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ariana & Evans is a luxury shaving and fragrance brand started in 2017 by Peter Charkalis. A&E's name comes from Peter's daughter's middle name Ariana and his own, Evans. A&E splits its production into its own brand and a separate but related membership- only brand, The Club.  The Club started out commissioning soaps, scents, and splashes from other artisans in the community,but now A&E produces its own products. Ariana & Evans has been somewhat controversial in the wetshaving community for the consistent use of scantily-clad women and sexually suggestive imagery in its label artwork, using preformulated scents, and the ridiculousness of needing to pay for the privilege of buying soap as is The Club's business model. Despite any controversy,  though, A&E has been well known for exceptional performance and strong fragrancing.\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Vanille de Tabac comes in a nice solid translucent tub that seems similar to the ones used by Stirling Soaps, just translucent not green. The tub is adorned with one of the aforementioned controversial labels, a pinup girl posing seductively on a cigar. I don't personally mind this label and actually enjoy the art. But I understand why some would, especially since this type of art appears on many of its products.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Vanille de Tabac is a duplicate of Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanilla, very similar to Highland Springs Soap Comoany's Havana Vieja which I reviewed earlier in this series.VdT is described as:  a smooth oriental, opening immediately with opulent essences of tob*cco leaf and aromatic spice notes. The heart unfolds with creamy tonka bean, tob*cco flower, vanilla and cocoa and finishes with dry fruit accord enriched with sweet wood sap. \n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scent notes in Vanille de Tabac are listed as: *tobacco leaf, tonka bean, ginger spices, cocoa, and fruit*. Vanilla is not listed as a scent note nor is the sweet wood sap mentioned in the description.\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For me the scent opens with a very thin vanilla note followed by a whiff of cinammon that moves into an air of tangy fruit and cocoa before immediately diving deep into a dark and spicy tobacco note. The tobacco here is relatively natural based on my college aged rcollections of swisher sweets. It gets very spicy and funky, delving almost as deep into that territory as the actual Tom Ford scent but with a lot less oomph. Vanille de Tabac comes across as more natural than HSSX Havana Vieja and I think the de-emphasis on the vanilla note is a large reason why. Jumping quickly through aromatics into the tobacco note really grounds the scent. I also want to add that the spice of the tobacco note comes through a lot more clearly in Ariana & Evans Kaizen soap base than it does in most other tobacco soaps I have reviewed here and tried elsewhere. I know soap is not a true or pure medium for scent and I appreciate that achievement. The matching splash brings out a hair more vanilla but is otherwise the same. The scent on this splash is very strong and will easily stick around all day, which I love.\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanille de Tabac is in A&E's Kaizen base and while I beleive the company is now on Kaizen 2, the Kaizen base is still its most available for most products. \n\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaizen's ingredients are listed as: *Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Aqua, Goats Milk, Potassium Hydroxide,  Kokum Butter, Shea Butter, Castor Oil, Cocoa Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Manteca, Aloe Juice, Avocado Oil, Hemp Seed Oil, Apricot Kernal Seed Oil, Lanolin, Agave, Slippery Elm, Sodium Lactate, Xanthan Gum, Silk Amino Acid, Tussah Silk, and Marshmallow Root.*\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&E's Kaizen base is frankly a stellar performer with its only close competition coming from Wholly Kaw and their Siero Base, and maybe Declaration Grooming's MilkSteak base too. Kaizen is very easy to lather; despite benefitting from a lot of water the lather comes together quickly and easily. Kaizen still performs better than average when underhydrated and can handle a ton of water before breaking down. Cushion, slickness, residual slickness, and post shave feel are all top notch. I could honestly do two passes on my head as well as touch ups with only one application of lather with no real issues, but I will admit heads are a little easier to shave. \n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&E's ' Skin Food' splash is nice and refreshing too. Skin food's ingredients are: *Aloe Vera Juice, Vegetable Glycerin, SD 40B Alcohol, Rose Hydrosol, Calendula Extract , Red Clover Extract, Chamomile, Plantain Leaves, White Willow Bark, Vitamin E, Caprylic Triglycerides ( combination of plant sugars and fatty acids derived from palm and coconut oils for silkier feel and as a natural preservative)*\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is refreshing and light and very similar to Noble Otter's splash and is bested by Zingariman recovery splash which is just a bit lighter and more refreshing. A&E skin food is still a great splash and I personally enjoy the heavy perfuming.\n\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the other soaps I have reviewed so far Vanille de Tabac comes out on top in both scent and performance for this reviewer. I personally really enjoy the balance of the scent here, despite being a dupe, it is very well executed. The vanilla is toned down to a level where its presence is just noticed and the aromatics of fruit and chocolate add an air of complexity to an otherwise simple scent. The tobacco itself is very dark and dirty without being overly dry and brings quite a lot of spice to the picture which suits my personal taste. I like that VdT is a more natural version of Havana Vieja and brings more punch than Cognac and Cuban Cigars. It also digs deeper into cured tobacco spice than either Valedictorian or Pee de Provence No 63 and so Vanille de Tabac takes the top spot.\n\nAs of round 5 the current Tobacco Throwdown Standings are thus:\n\n* [#1. Ariana & Evans Vanille de Tabac](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/m6y9qa/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_5_ariana_evans/?)\n\n* [#2. Henri et Victoria Cognac and Cuban Cigars](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/lvwwij/tobacco_throwdown_day_1_henri_et_victoria_cognac/)\n\n* [#3. Highland Springs Soap Company Havan Vieja](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/lyb2k8/tobacco_throwdown_round_2_highland_springs_soap/)\n\n* [#4. Summer Break Soaps Valedictorian](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/m4tdmg/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_4_summer_break_soaps/?)\n\n* [#5. Pre  de Provence No. 63](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/m1786o/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_3_pre_de_provence_no/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariana and Evans may be a controversial company but they put out some very attractive scents as well as making top notch soaps. And whether it's preformulated or not Vanille de Tabac is a fantastic scent. A&E has some issues, but I do think that Kaizen base is worth a shot and A&E probably has a scent you would like. That said I have toned down my enthusiasm for their products since learning more about their controversies (I'd totally buy a bottle of Dirty Ginger AS Splash if you have one to sell though).\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I hope you all have enjoyed this segment of the Tobacco Throwdown, I will be back with another this weekend!\n\n\n*I purchased these products on my own and I am in no way affiliated with Ariana and Evans*",

Controversial is not necessarily a bad thing, but I do understand how some feel about the pinup series (our take on the Varga pinup girls of the 50’s). Some will be happy to know that I’m phasing those labels out, although I really love Vacanza Romana, so I may keep that. Otherwise, I invite anyone to visit our site and report back what is offensive. Ohhh, I won’t be changing the label on Vanille de Tabac, which I think is fine. Yes, I do have a model Justine and may do another photoshoot for a different line, so hope you guys don’t find her so offensive. We are growing and in the beginning I must admit, I wanted to turn heads and get noticed (marketing), with the understanding that some would find it a bit less than tasteful. I was willing to take that risk. I have no regrets for that decision. Strictly from a business perspective it was the right move initially. Now time to standardize a bit more, but we will continue pushing the envelope as that’s just what we do and who I am. Love me or hate me, there’s nothing quite like our brand and brand differentiation is critical. All that said, thank you once again. I’m honored to be here.",

    "body": "I know this question gets asked a lot here. I asked it two months ago and the responses were pretty 🤷🏻‍♀️ “nothing you can do about your bitch-ass placenta.”\n\nBut I did do something so wanted to share my experience.\n\nAbout me: this is my 3rd baby, first time with GD. I started at a normal BMI but have put on about 60 lbs this pregnancy. I’m 38 years old. I’ve gained about the same with each pregnancy but this time I’m older and it’s pretty clear my insulin resistance was worse—no denying it.\n\nI failed the 1 hour (151) and skipped the 3-hour choosing to track my numbers instead. Like many, controlling my post meal numbers didn’t seem too hard if I avoided simple carbs, but my fasting numbers were elevated (96-105) about 75% of the time. So at 28 weeks they said I had GD, my midwives kicked me out, I had to get an OB, MFM, an RD, the whole thing. It was upsetting. My MFM wanted to put me in an insulin study our very first meeting, said I had to be induced prior to 40 weeks, had to do weekly NSTs after 36 weeks, the whole nine yards. I asked her to give me some time to see if I can control with diet and exercise, and she reluctantly agreed.\n\nYesterday, at 37+4 she cleared me, said I don’t need anything, baby looks perfect, I don’t need to be induced nor have I needed any NSTs, and she was overall super impressed that I was so committed to lowering my numbers and actually got them down from where they were.\n\nSO, here’s all the things I tried, and then I’ll end with what actually worked for me:\n\n-every type of snack imaginable before bedtime\n-taking apple cider vinegar, psylium husk, cinnamon before bed (I called it my apple pie drink)\n-resistance training of various kinds (bands, weights, etc)\n-hundreds of squats a day\n-swimming laps\n-aqua fitness\n-prenatal yoga\n-prenatal barre \n-having an egg at night if I got up to pee (something the RD said I should try)\n-aloe Vera juice (shown to lower fasting numbers in some small studies)\n\nHere’s what actually got my numbers down consistently in the 70-80s range:\n\n-Walking. I go for a morning waddle, afternoon waddle, evening waddle. They tell you to do this after meals to lower your numbers but it actually helped lower my fasting numbers more than anything. I end up walking somewhere between 4-5 miles a day, roughly 11-13k steps. I don’t do it all at once, that’s too hard on my back and SPD. But I know if I manage 4 miles, my fasting number the next morning will be below 95.\n-I don’t have snacks if I’m not hungry. Seems like a no brainer. Once I realized I don’t have to keep eating when I’m not hungry, it lowered my numbers even more. I don’t think a lot of us are here because we don’t eat enough.\n\nI don’t want this to turn into a fight about taking insulin vs not taking insulin. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with having to take insulin. I wanted to avoid another intervention if it could be avoided. I also took the statistics about how we’re more likely to develop T2D to heart and started reading about insulin resistance. I plan on sticking to a low simple-carb diet going forward and working on building muscle after I’m cleared for exercise. If there’s something that I could do to be healthier for my kids, I’m going to try to do it. I just want this post to exist for other women to see what worked for me. I was hoping to see things like this two months ago when I started this and couldn’t find much so maybe this can help someone else.\n\nTLDR; lots of walking and less snacking.",

I made sure to go on two significant walks a day- 20ish minutes during work since that was all I could manage due to time and a long walk in the evening.\n\nMy absolute biggest factor for my fasting numbers was quality of sleep! Nothing I ate/didn’t eat had any affect on my fasting numbers. I ended up changing my daily routine to allow myself to be 100000% fully relaxed about an hour before bed. So I started showering at night, heavily limited phone/tv time to avoid screen time, and prepared for the next morning so I didn’t have to worry about it while trying to fall asleep. Also got a really comfy eye mask and truly stuck to a bed time. Now PP my bed routine is so helpful. Since I have interrupted sleep due to feeding baby my routine is just as important now.\n\nThank you for sharing! Success stories are always helpful even if they don’t work for everyone.

This gets diagnosed as gestational diabetes but isn’t really GD, it’s prediabetes or type 2.

I now know I can't eat rice at all not even basmati or brown rice despite the nurse telling me to eat a bigger portion of rice with my meal 🙄 I seem to be fine with a decent portion of wholewheat pasta though. My after meal readings have been pretty much perfect for weeks now that I've worked out what doesn't spike me. However because my fasting readings are high now and then I'm still battling to try and stay diet controlled. I say high they have literally been one or two points over what they should be and I know if I lived in a different area they'd be within the rage so it's frustrating. It's also not every day. \n\nI've been experimenting with exercise and different things to try and get that fasting number down, Apple cider vinegar, cinnamon and a small chunk of cheese before bed seems to help, also a strength workout in the evening after my evening meal seems to give me a good reading in the morning but at 6 months pregnant and working full time I don't always want to do a strength workout in the evening 😫😫 I totally agree that walking seems to be brilliant for controlling the levels. We've recently been on holiday where we were walking loads and I managed to eat a carbonara with white spaghetti one day and got a perfect reading then another day had an ice-cream and again perfect reading I think because I was walking so much. Sadly I struggle to fit the walking in around my job. \n\nI think the diabetes nurse is phoning me this week so I'll see what she says about my numbers but ideally I'd like to remain diet controlled as long as possible.",

I spritzed my hair with water and reapplied oil to my scalp and my ends 2-3 times a week. i also did the banding method on my hair every night before bed to stretch my WNGs or my afro. i got braids/twists/locs often because i thought they were protective styles. i learned this all from YouTube and at the time, it 100% made sense to me. \n\ni also had an ridiculous number of hair care products. i basically had a mini beauty supply store in my room. and i’m so mad because i wish I could get that money back. \n\ni also put a lot of food in my hair. i mainly used store bought deep conditioners because I am lazy, but i did love making mayonnaise hair masks and spritzing my hair with aloe vera juice. i also tried eggs, onion juice, black tea, bananas, and avocados as natural deep conditioners. this is insane to me now (do not put onion juice in your hair!!!!!). \n\nidk about you guys, but i genuinely thought my haircare routine was working. I didn’t know that my hair was chronically dehydrated or that it was not behaving like healthy hair should because it looked the way I wanted it to look, it felt soft and plush to the touch, and it was growing. a lot\n\ni love that washing, conditioning, styling, and drying my hair only takes 2 hours a week. this is very convenient of course, but the very best part of my hair routine is how how light my hair is now. i never realized how heavy my hair was because I didn’t know that the oils and butters were weighing it down. it didn’t feel heavy before, but now, my hair is so LIGHT. i can’t even describe it. it’s just fluffy and light and it moves so easily. I’m amazed every time.",

        "body": "Nope! I have high porosity hair. I don’t know why because I’ve never dyed my hair before, but yes, my hair is very high in porosity, and the cosmetologist that I go to explained that this is because my cuticles are VERY raised (this is not good apparently). \n\nBecause I’m a high porosity girlie, I also thought that if I didn’t use oil, my hair would lose all moisture. In fact, I even started using Blue Magic instead of oil because I thought it was better at sealing in moisture. My hair sucked it all up and I had to redo the LCO method 2-3 times a week. I could do the LCO process on Monday and need to redo it all by Wednesday because my hair would be BONE DRY 😭😭😭 Now I know why and it wasn’t because my hair is high porosity.\n\nRaw oil cannot “seal” in moisture. That’s just not what oil does. Raw oil is a lubricant, not a moisturizer or a sealant. Water is going to evaporate from your hair every 4-7 days, so the only way to keep water in your hair is to just wash your hair regularly. The shampooing process IS the moisturizing process because you’re blasting your hair with water, and WATER = moisture. The conditioner is what “seals” moisture because conditioner lays your cuticles back down (after shampooing lifts them up during the cleansing process) to “hold in” water. regardless, that water will still evaporate within 4-7 days, which is why you need to wash your hair again. And again and again.\n\nWhen you put raw oil on your hair to “seal” in moisture, you are actually sealing OUT moisture because you’ve created a layer of oil buildup that causes your hair to resist water or not hold onto to water for very long. This is true even for high porosity hair, but it was hard for me to understand what this meant until I stopped using oils and seen how my hair responds to water now compared to before.\n\nThis is the analogy that someone told me that helped me: Let’s say you pour water on the floor. You don’t want the floor to stop being wet, so you pour oil on top of the water spill. The next day, what happens? The floor will eventually dry up and what’s going to be left? An oil spill because that water has already evaporated. Why? Because oil cannot keep water from evaporating. Now if you go and try to pour water and top of that oil spill, what happens? The water just sits on top of the oil because oil and water do not mix.\n\nAlso: when you are thirsty, what do you do? Drink oil? No, you drink water right? Because water is hydrating. Your hair needs that hydration too, but hydration ONLY comes from water, not from products. If your body feels dry and itchy, what’s the solution? Get your body very wet, use soap, and lotion up. It’s the same thing with your hair. When your hair is dry, you get your hair very wet, use shampoo, then conditioner.\n\nYou can do whatever you like with your hair because it’s on your head, but if you’d like to try it, you need to give yourself at minimum a month to see results. Every week, just shampoo and condition your hair, then use a styling product of your choice to style your hair. After 3-4 weeks of weekly washing and no raw oils or hair grease, I noticed that my hair was easier to detangle and it just felt soft and plush. It didn’t feel lubricated like how it did with oils, but soft, light, and plush. So I just never touched oils again and I didn’t need to use hair butter because there was just no need for it.\n\nFor me:\n\nAfro = shampoo, conditioner, leave in OR foaming mousse\n\nMini braids/twists = Shampoo, conditioner, and wrap foam\n\nWash and go = Shampoo, conditioner, and two layered gels\n\nTwistout/braid out = Shampoo, conditioner, and wrap foam\n\nedit: typos lol",

About 7-8 years ago I went to a natural hair event here in DC put a celeb stylist who also was doing hair on her hotel room (you had to come with your hair washed and conditioned). She properly shingled my hair and defined the curls using a gel aye makes,  a whipped shea butter product that her partner in the event makes and sells. She would take a section of wet hair, and apply the shea butter and then the gel. Told the audience at the event that you need to put some type of moisturizer under your geo always. They even showed people how to make it.\n\nI've always been a product junkie even when I relaxed and had a store full of products in my house. I used to order their shea butter and use that or some type of cream. I've been natural for maybe 20 years and decide early after its inception that the LOC/LCO methods made my hair gross. Loved Mielle when it came out and would use their leave-in and mint almond oil all the time. I would do wash and goes, dry them under my hooded dryer and then add the shea butter and mint almond oil several times a week for moisture.\n\nThen one day in March 2022, right after I cut all my hair down to about 2 inches, the monarch hair lady was posting about oils being bad for your hair on Twitter and I posted a pic I had of my hair and the two products I used weekly and she asked why I was drying my hair out. It insisted I wasn't and was about to send her cyber syphilis for calling my hair dry, but then I googled the 30 day hair detox and decided to try it. I already had products without oils and butters so it was easy. It made me realize that I had to add the oil and butter every couple of days because it was dry. And that the products were drying my hair out. My hair has grown a lot and is so much healthier.",

I have high porosity hair and currently believe that if I don't put oil in it, it will lose all of its moisture. If I were to wet it and let it air dry, it would take like 30 minutes to dry. Which is very short considering I have thick, mid back length hair. I honestly wouldn't know how to keep it hydrated if it weren't for oil locking in the moisture, but maybe I'm missing something? \n\nOils and butters don't weigh my hair down, like at all. They get sucked up like the rest of whatever I put on it. I have *very* high porosity hair. Basically a sponge on my head.

I still keep it simple, as I'm lazy asf, but I really do think  this regimen would break off my hair. \n\nIt makes sense for low porosity hair types that can hold moisture without the extra help, but for highest porosities that know no bounds, I'm not sure.

        "body": "For the most part yeah I've been done with oil and butters for a very long time. They always left my hair feeling very dry and oily. Adding water just made my hair feel worse and difficult to work with. My hair stayed tangled, too, and washing it out completely wasn't easy. The scalp irritation was another problem. Adding oils, grease, etc, never actually solved that problem.  My last stint was with the As I Am double butter cream and my hair felt very dry and oily as I was applying it. My hair had become so dry and brittle that as I was applying, some of my ends snapped. I was completely over extremely firm gels (like edge control) and braids when I got a (really expensive) knotless braid installation last year. The dye in the hair leaked and caused an allergic reaction. The way the braids were cauterized damaged my hair. Washing was a nightmare and caused snapping and overstretched my actual hair, leaving it overstretched and swollen for hours since that ish wouldn't dry. I worried about mildew, mold, and bacteria since I'd wake up and they would still be damp. Mini twists with my own hair don't hold well in my hair either as my hair wants to slip out and frizz up (breakage). I will do them (mini or larger), but I won't keep them in for very long, 2 weeks at best ifa can hold out for that long. Only in the takedown, I may use a warmed oil to lubricate the strands, so I'm not detangling completely dry hair since water will simply cause it it coil up and exacerbate the tangles, which I don't want. It's promptly followed by a wash, so the oil never stays in my hair or in my scalp,  which makes it itchy, flaky, and could cause plaque, among other issues.\n\n I wore those braids for roughly 14 weeks (tried to make the money worth it). After assessing the damage, I said enough was enough and decided to learn to love my hair as it was, in its shrunken state.  So I started doing wash and go and dust as needed. I've been doing this for a little over 6 months now I guess and I absolutely love it, and I feel my hair is looking and performing at its best. But it's made me a little lazy lol. I feel it's more work and more detangling when it's stretched or in twists.  My mantra really is KISS lol. I either 'rinse and scritch' or cowash every 3-4 days and wash every 8-10 days, so my showers last maybe 15 minutes.  No dandruff, bad smells,  dryness, stinging or itching, flaking, brittleness, hair loss, thinning, nothing. I use a pick every several weeks to gently check for thorough detangling (extends my shower by an extra few minutes, but oh well).  I'm in and out of the bathroom in about an hour from shower to completely dressed and ready to go. I've learned that type 4 hair isn't difficult if you don't make it difficult.",

Plus, if oil was making their hair grow, then why haven’t black people seen the same results since oiling our hair is a part of our cultures as well? Not to mention that South Asian women naturally tend to grow a lot of hair. It’s genetics, you know? And not just on their heads. Many of them have also thick arm hair, thick, full eyebrows, some upper lip hair, and even light back hair or light chin hair. It’s not surprising that the hair on their heads would be long and thick as well.

It makes sense, the whole thing about an oil spill and what not. But if this were the case, then simply putting oil on your hair would prevent it from reverting. But that obviously doesn't happen, humidity makes its way in fine. At least for me 😅  water and oil don't mix, but they can pass through each other. \n\n I already wet my hair about once a week becuase of styling, but I do add oil bc I want the lubricant. I did think oil locks in moisture, but I knew oil didn't provide the moisture. Regardless, even though I thought oil locked in moisture, I still thought it had its limits and would wet my hair if it was dry. I think with people who damage their hair with oil, the damage comes from thinking that oil provides moisturization.\n\nTruly, I think I was using a happy middle ground without knowing it. I don't shampoo my hair every week, but I do rinse it every 5-7 days. I do use oil and now I know it was just acting as a lubricant. Now that I know that, I think I'll keep using it becuase it doesn't create a build up on my hair. I don't use heavy oils or butter, I use a light breathable oil. \n\nThank you so much for your explanation, I think maybe I'll try the regimen for at least a week.

Your answer might be different, and you have to decide if hair aesthetic or hair health is more important to you.\n\nFor gels, like the other respondent said, botanical gels are your best bet. Personally, I use Uncle Funky’s topped with Innersense’s I Create Hold gel. Innersense’s gel is the best gel I’ve ever used, but i won’t lie, it has a little crunch to it. It’s not super crunchy (nothing like Ecostyler), but there’s definitely a little crunch.

Some Rx medication they used on me ended up being banned due to toxicity. Nothing has helped, including any store bought shampoo (H&S, T gel, etc), avoiding sulfates, even stuff prescribed by a dermatologist (ketaconozole). My scalp itches if I don't wash it everyday, and since I have long hair I have to blow dry or it is a wet curly mop, this is an issue. \n\nI saw that Atlanta Body Culinary had a shampoo and conditioner for eczema and thought I would try it. Not too pricey, first ingredient is aloe vera juice. I got the grapefruit basil smell, and it might be the first time any bath and body company has NAILED the smell of basil. It really sticks in your hair, when combing it wet (dissipates when dry). Made my bathroom smell amazing. My hair was pretty smooth and not frizzy, soft.\n\nThe real exciting part: I washed my hair Tuesday morning and blow dried it later in the day. Wednesday I curled it and used a ton of hair spray. Then got sweaty/pretty dirty that day. And still haven't washed it today. And zero itchiness. I am so shocked it has achieved something even an Rx couldn't do!! \n\n5/5 I do recommend.",

Wet a **warm washcloth** with distilled/filtered water, or heat a wet washcloth in the microwave, and hold it on my face for 1-5 minutes (depending on how patient I am haha). This is really helpful downstream in getting my skin to absorb the moisturizers.\n2. Apply pure **aloe vera juice** (I use Aubrey brand) to my face including my eyelids. This acts like a toner in preparing skin for moisture. It also reduces inflammation and softens the dry patches.\n3. On my eyelids, apply a small amount of **coconut oil**.\n4. On my face, apply **Cerave** Facial PM or Skin Renewing cream. I find coconut oil to be a little too moisturizing on the rest of my face and causes acne.\n5. On my face and ESPECIALLY my eyelids, apply a layer of **shea butter**. This is my emollient layer to lock it all in.\n\nI usually start feeling clear by Day 2 of this routine and it is almost 100&#37; gone on Day 4. (Photo 1 was taken Wednesday, Photo 2 today, both post moisturizing) I hope that can help some people find relief for facial eczema. This sub has been so helpful in my eczema healing and sanity, and wanted to give back a little! <3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0cxmk3bzkg411.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a602c0b1806671079ba38e8b5f1be77f458da7",

Very easy to use, but the problem arises when the product is about to finish. I learnt from this sub to cut your products nearing finish to use up the excess product that gets stuck to the tube. This ain't possible for Derma Co Sunscreen as the packaging makes it difficult to cut the product. So once the pump stops dispensing the product, I'm left with the option to throw it.\n\nAnother problem I liked is that It ain't travel friendly. If you're someone like me who prefers sling bags or small satchel bags, this product ain't travel friendly.\n\n**My Experience:** The gel-like texture of the product is so lightweight, it's so comfortable to apply on face. It blends it so smoothly, that it almost feels like a moisturizer. It was like applying your Moisturizer twice. It blended comfortably without any white cast. On occasional moments, it did pill, but I remember those days to be in a rush to not have applied it properly or went out in the sun too quickly, so I probably think that the pilling was due to me.\n\nThere's a mild fragrance that wasn't bothersome. My favourite part was the dewy finish. This product convinced me to opt for dewy finish rather than matte. It didn't make my face look oily and it wasn't sticky.\n\nThe only problem I have is that, I haven't yet been able to find proof of this product being tested as a sunscreen. Does it really claim to protect you against sunrays?\n\nA very affordable product, if it's confirmed that it truly protect against UV rays, I can see it becoming my HG sunscreen. \n\n**WRP:** Will defining repurchase subject to it's credibility as a sunscreen.",

I experienced my first ever massive flare up in December 2024 my symptoms were sour mouth so potent that I would need to swish mouth wash every 2-3 hours. Chest pain, regurgitation,mild heartburn, and a small cough I developed. I would do everything in the book to try and get better 20 mg of pantoperazole morning,Pepcid at night for the first month of the flare then around middle of January I decided to do anything aloe Vera juice in the morning and night, ginger tea with cut up ginger, slippery elm in the middle of the day,melatonin. My symptoms from December did start to ease around February the potent taste decreased, I stopped regurgitating when I started ppi , I still had chest pains from time to time and the heartburn went away as well. Around march I decided to contact a gi to see if the could maybe go in and see what’s going on since I was still having these minor symptoms. They wanted to do a endoscopy with bravo and I decided against it because the gi said it can take up to 6 months for things to heal. Well it looks like he wasn’t to far off around Late April my sour taste was pretty much gone it comes maybe a few times out of the day very light taste for 30 minutes usually after meals. But besides that I don’t have much other gerd symptoms. I decreased to 20mg40mg of Pepcid only within the time frame, and probiotics and psyllium seed. My diet is garbage and I’m sure if I stuck to a gerd friendly diet I could heal things even more but it’s hard to be on a gerd friendly diet. But this is just a reminder to you all things can get better. I for one thought life was over I was going to have to live with this strong taste for life or take a huge risk on surgery but after reading through countless fourms about surgery it’s a huge risk and should only be considered if you are dealing with super uncontrollable gerd like throwing up non stop, Barretts , over 50. Also staying off this group helps a lot when your dealing with a flare this group is filled with to much anxiety the chances of you all having cancer or barrets is so low and the progress from barrets to cancer is so low at 20 years of barrets your chances of cancer is only 3% ",

I personally have not come to a conclusion on reactions from long term exposure to fragrance, whether citrus extracts increase photosensitivity, and the effectiveness of formulas with lots of plant extracts like here. When I saw how much phenoxyethanol the Imperial Bird's Nest contains I was immediately turned off. \n\nApple polyphenol seems low in irritants and Aloe is high in sodium hyaluronate.\n\nMBD is a very established mask brand in Taiwan. They started in 2003, but they have only released masks so far. There have been many other brands that have made it in and out of Taiwan since then, like Naruko for those looking for targeted treatments and White Essence with lotions more advanced than Hada Labo. \n\nThere are many other sheet masks ranges in Taiwan, and they have to be good enough to retain market share against market leader MBD. I haven't looked at any of them.

So, it is very useful in treating atherosclerosis (blood vessels clogged with clot and fat deposition).\n\n\n2) For constipation, 10 gram pulp of aloevera paste is made with rock salt, mixed well and then boiled(to evaporate the water content). Take this once a day.\n\n\n3) Aloe Vera leaf is heated on burning charcoal, cuticle  is removed and pulp is scraped and squeezed in cloth to get the juice. One teaspoon of this juice is added with two drops of ghee and 4 drops of honey and licked hourly to relieve attacks of breathlessness and wheezing.\n\n              Click here for more information about Ghee\n\n4) Healing effect : polysaccharide, and gibberellin, a growth hormone, interacts with growth factor receptors on the fibroblast, thereby stimulating its activity and proliferation, which in turn significantly increases collagen synthesis after topical and oral Aloe vera.9 Aloe gel not only increased collagen content of the wound but also changed collagen composition (more type III) and increased the degree of collagen cross linking. Due to this, it accelerated wound contraction and increased the breaking strength of resulting scar tissue. An increased synthesis of hyaluronic acid and dermatan sulfate in the granulation tissue of a healing wound following oral or topical treatment.\n\n            > Wound healing is a dynamic process, occurring in 3 phases. The first phase is inflammation, hyperaemia and leukocyte infiltration. The second phase consists of re-moval of dead tissue. The third phase of proliferation consisting of epithelial regeneration and formation of fibrous tissue.\n\n            - The leaf pulp is useful to heal burn wounds, boils, acne, blisters, allergic skin disorders.\n\n            - Its pulp is added with turmeric powder and heated for a minute and this is applied externally(acne, wound, allergic skin) and internally on mouth ulcer(2-3 times a day).\n\n               Click here for more information about Turmeric (Haldi)\n\n5) Oil prepared with Aloe Vera in sesame oil or olive oil base is very useful against diaper rashes.\n\n                  Click here for more information about sesame seed/oil\n\n6) Skin protection effect from uv and gmma ray exposure : Aloe vera gel has been reported to have a protective effect against radiation damage to the skin. An antioxidant protein, metallothionein, is generated in the skin, which scavenges hydroxyl radicals and prevents suppression of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the skin. It reduces the production and release of skin keratinocyte-derived immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and hence prevents UV-induced suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity.\n\n                 - Aloe Vera juice is good for stomach, skin diseases.\n\n\n7) Anti-inflammatory action : Aloe vera inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway and reduces prostaglandin E2 production from arachidonic acid. With this, the novel anti-inflammatory compound called C-glucosyl chromone was isolated from gel extracts.\n\n\n8) Laxative effects : Anthraquinones present in latex are a potent laxative. It increases intestinal water content, stomach upset, stimulates mucus secretion and increases intestinal peristalsis.\n\nIntake : Take Aloevera juice regularly in early morning on empty stomach.\n\n\n9) Moisturizing and anti-aging effect : Mucopolysaccharides help in binding moisture into the skin. Aloe stimulates fibroblast which produces the collagen and elastin fibers making the skin more elastic and less wrinkled. It also has cohesive effects on the superficial flaking epidermal cells by sticking them together, which softens the skin. The amino acids also soften hardened skin cells and zinc acts as an astringent to tighten pores.\n\nApplication - you should apply it externally and internally (juice / slimy gel).\n\n\n10) Antiseptic effect : Aloe vera contains 6 antiseptic agents: Lupeol, salicylic acid, urea nitrogen, cinnamonic acid, phenols and sulfur. They all have inhibitory action on fungi, bacteria and viruses.\n\n\n11) Regular intake of mild doses of aloe vera in the form of capsule or juice, is very beneficial in hemorrhoids treatment. Because of it's mild laxative action and wound healing property.\n\n\n12) Five phytosterols(lophenol, 24-methyl-lophenol, 24-ethyl-lophenol, cycloartanol and 24-methy-lenecycloartanol) of Aloe Vera have been identified with anti-diabetic activity. It is a good anti oxidant and it maintains healthy structure of the blood vessels. Both these are very vital in diabetic care. Hence it is very useful in diabetic management.   (Pls consult ayurvedic practitioner before use).\n\n\n13) It helps to protect the sensitive tissue in the mouth, dry mouth and enhances the taste buds\n\n                  - Drink aloevera juice once a day in morning after you wake up.\n\n\n14) Because of its antidandruff property, it(pulp/powder) is used in antidandruff hair oil and shampoo.\n\n\n15) For weight loss : Take half a teaspoon of aloe Vera pulp. Heat it a little. Add a teaspoon of honey to it. Take it at night after food. OR you should add triphala to it.  OR. This remedy is also good for kapha imbalance and asthma.\n\n           Click here for more information about Honey\n\n\n16) Laxative effect(substances that loosens the stool and increase bowl movement) of aloevera can be increased by using it along with cardamom or cumin seed powder.\n\n           Click here for more information about Cumin seeds\n\n           Click here for more information about Cardamom (Elachi)\n\n17) Aloe latex contains anthraquinones compounds that actively heal and reduce pain through natural anti-inflammatory effects.\n\n\n18) In western societies, especially in the USA, Aloevera has been grown mainly to supply the latex component of the leaf to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\n19) Aloe material has been used for drug absorption enhancement for drugs with low bioavailability due to extensive efflux.\n\n\n20) Aloin and its gel are used as skin tonic against pimples. Aloe vera is also used for soothing the skin, and keeping the skin moist to help avoid flaky scalp and skin in harsh and dry weather. The Aloe sugars are also used in mois-turizing preparations.  Mixed with selected essential oils, it makes an excellent skin smoothening moisturizer, sun block lotion plus a whole range of beauty products.\n\n\n21) Aloe juice is helpful in smooth functioning of the body machinery. It reduces cell-damaging process during stress condition and minimizes biochemical and physio-logical changes in the body.\n\n\n22) Application of Aloe Vera pulp to the scalp reduces dandruff and nourishes the hair follicles.\n\n\n23) It is best to avoid it during pregnancy........\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference :\n[more information on AloeVera](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2020/10/aloe-vera-commonly-known-as-barbados-or.html)\n\n1) Indian Journal Of Dermatology ; 2008; 53(4): 163–166.\n\ndoi: 10.4103/0019-5154.44785\n\n2) Natural Medicine Journal ; September 2012 Vol. 4 Issue 9 : https://www.naturalmedicinejournal.com/journal/2012-09/aloe-vera-gel-research-review\n\n3) The Review on Properties of Aloe Vera in Healing of Cutaneous Wounds; Volume 2015 |Article ID 714216 : https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/714216/\n\n4) Aloe vera: An Ancient Herb for Modern Dentistry—A Literature Review; Volume 2014 |Article ID 210463 : https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jds/2014/210463/\n\n5) Identification of five phytosterols from Aloe vera gel as anti-diabetic compounds : https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16819181/\n\n6) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225411014000078\n\n7) Therapeutic and Medicinal Uses of Aloe vera: A Review : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262698658\n\n8) Book - Dravya Gunna Vigyan Vol 2\n\n9) https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/aloe-vera\n\n10) Wikipedia\n\n11) local tradition and knowledge\n\n12) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313368556_REVIEW_ON_ALOE_VERA-MEDICINAL_PLANT ",

No one wants deposits covering their vital mucosa and membranes throughout the G.I./digestive tract.\n\nListen to the islanders. They can go so far as treating (reversal of) cancer with Soursop, BUT only if used in the *correct manner*, religiously, without compromise. Fresh. Plentiful. Multiple times per day. Every meal. Watch diet carefully, go by the practitioner’s guidelines. \n\n(Whereas...in America / western medicine, the practitioners aren’t taught the correct ways, given, it isn’t profitable to teach such in med school, coz... one cannot patent a full spectrum, whole plant, that is all-natural)",

    "body": "**First things first, about my skin:**\n\nI live in a really humid, hot tropical country and I have really oily skin. To the level that during the day at work, I can easily go through five or six oil blotting sheets. When I wake up in the morning from sleeping, despite being in an airconditioned room, there's a thin sheen of oil on my face. But oddly enough I had this consistent dry patch of skin near the corner of my lip. I think my skin was dehydrated after going on a beach trip and was overcompensating by making more oil. I've used a clear gel moisturizer for the longest time only because anytime I tried something thicker, my face would break out. But I could tell it just wasn't moisturizing enough for my skin. Which is how a friend recommended to me Nature Republic's Super Aqua Max Watery Cream (what a mouthful!) at least for the PM moisturizer.\n\nThey have variants for oily, dry, and combination skin but I chose the combination because the reviews I saw recommended it, it's the one my friend uses, and given I have that dry patch on my face, I figured I'd go for the combination one to address it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqy40m2aae211.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ce8ac54563d6e7e28e50f893d34b22b385b15f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84rawz6bae211.jpg?width=1278&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9143842540e8b7297f0dc09d3c6e0481ee1a2d5\n\n[Texture is sort of the in between of a gel and a cream? Yeah, it's my first skincare review. Haha!](https://preview.redd.it/xwqspu7eae211.jpg?width=1278&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a8c838c9beb40fd34c9701d8f4108c15247c5c3)\n\n**INGREDIENTS (from the Nature Republic USA website):**\n\nSEA WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, CYCLOMETHICONE, DIMETHICONE, PEG\\-10 DIMETHICONE/VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIU ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PIPER METHYSTICUM LEAF/ROOT/STEM EXTRACT, PORTULACA OLERACEA EXTRACT, PUERARIA THUNBERGIANA ROOT EXTRACT, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, PAEONIA LACTIFLORA ROOT EXTRACT, CNIDIUM OFFICINALE ROOT EXTRACT, ULMUS DAVIDIANA ROOT EXTRACT, AMARANTHUS CAUDATUS SEED EXTRACT, SARGASSUM MUTICUM EXTRACT, HYPNEA MUSCIFORMIA EXTRACT, ULVA LACTUCA EXTRACT, ECKLONIA CAVA EXTRACT, CODIUM TOMENTOSUM EXTRACT, AGARUM CRIBOSUM EXTRACT, ENTEROMORPHA COMPRESSA EXTRACT, LAMINARIA JAPONICA EXTRACT, DUNALIELLA SALINA EXTRACT, SARGASSUM FULVELLUM EXTRACT, PORPHYRA YEZOENSIS EXTRACT, FUCUS VESICULOSUS EXTRACT, LAMINARIA SACCHARINA EXTRACT, SPIRULINA PLATENSIS EXTRACT, JANIA RUBENS EXTRACT, GELIDIUM CARTILAGINEUM EXTRACT, MACROCYSTIS PYRIFERA EXTRACT, ALGAE EXTRACT, UNDARIA PINNATIFIDA EXTRACT, CODIUM FRAGILE EXTRACT, LAMINARIA CLOUSTONI EXTRACT, CHLORELLA MINUTISSIMA EXTRACT, HIZIKIA FUSIFORME EXTRACT, SALICORNIA HERBACEA EXTRACT, PIKEA ROBUSTA EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED ALGAE EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED ULVA LACTUCA EXTRACT, HAEMATOCOCCUS PLUVIALIS EXTRACT, LAMINARIA DIGITATA EXTRACT, SOLUBLE COLLAGEN, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, SQUALANE, WATER, 1,2\\-HEXANDIOL, CARBOMER, POLYSORBATE 20, PEG\\-10 DIMETHICONE, TROMETHAMINE, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, DIMETHICONE/VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, POLYSORBATE 60, BETAINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, LACTOBACILLUS/ALGAE EXTRACT FERMENT, MACROCYSTIS PHRIFERA (KELP) PROTEIN, ALGAE OLIGOSACCHARIDES, CHLORELLA FERMENT, XANTHAN GUM, FRAGRANCE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CI 19140, CI\\-42090      \n\n**CONS:**\n\nGetting these out of the way:\n\n* It comes in a jar, with no additional scooper/spoon thing. And I know a lot of people are particular about that.\n* It's also very heavily scented. Don't get me wrong, personally I find it to be a nice, clean, refreshing scent and it does kind of make me think of the ocean, but it is kind of strong. 10 minutes after I've put it on, I can still kind of smell it on my face. But I know a lot of people are sensitive about fragrance on products, so if you are, yeah, don't get it.\n\n**PROS:**\n\n* It's pretty affordable! I was thinking of trying this or the Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis Essence and it's about 1/4 of its selling price (at least here in my country). \n* It's been about a month since I've been putting it on \\- and no breakouts! That's honestly the bare minimum I ask for in a product. So I'm happy for that!\n* The texture is sort of that halfway point between a gel and a cream so just a little product goes a long way and I can easily smooth a small amount over my face and it glides on easily and sinks into the skin. I don't feel like it's just sitting on top of my skin. It also leaves a nice cooling feeling on my skin.\n* I can confidently say it's doing its part in moisturizing my face.\n   * When I apply it before going to bed, I wake up in the morning and I no longer have a layer of oil on my face. And now I know what it feels like for my skin to be smooth and soft in the mornings. I can really feel the difference on my skin when I start to layer products after it. \n   * Because it sinks in so well, I've started using it in the mornings before my sunscreen \\- and now instead of five oil blotting sheets a day, I can survive with one or two.\n   * I also no longer have the dry patch of skin near the corner of my mouth! I used to have to apply Vaseline on it every night but by the time I wash off the Vaseline in the morning it'd still be there. Now the dry patch is completely gone.\n\nSo overall, I'm really happy with it so far. I've always kinda ignored the Nature Republic in the mall because it doesn't have a lot of noise about it online (from what I've seen), so I'm happy to have tried this out.  \n\n\nEDIT: Included the comment that it's affordable!",

    "body": "#Review type \nRave! And so satisfied that I purchased this (based on the ergonomic bottle alone 👀) it's a 5/5 for me. I'm buying a new one tomorrow 😂\n\n#Skin type\nOily, sensitive, redness-prone, prone to malassezia overgrowth (\"fungal acne\") and mild but ever-present acne and PIH, thanks to hormones and slow-healing skin 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n🐳 Age: 30\n\n🐳 Current climate: Hot and humid\n\n#Usage timeline\nBought at Feb end, just finished the bottle. So it lasted two and a half months... I used it twice a week, mayyybe thrice the week before my period. I used... half a ₹1 coin size? On face and upper neck. \n\n\n🐳 Price: ₹275 for 30ml [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/Disrupt-Salicylic-Sulphate-Blackheads-Exfoliant/dp/B09FZLLSZG/). MRP marked as 445.\n\n#Ingredients\nAqua, Glycerin, Salicylic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Methylpropanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, C15-19 Alkane, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n#User experience\n\n[Packaging, product texture shots, pH strip results](https://imgur.com/a/IGMbYzm)\n\nA translucent, slightly milky, runny serum that sinks in fast, leaving no residue or tackiness. The brand advises to leave 1-2 minutes before layering other products. I've never had any pilling issues or anything. \n\nLeaves the skin feeling very slightly smoother than before application, but otherwise unchanged. I like that a lot about this serum ☺\n\nAlkanes are apparently plant-derived alternatives to silicones, and I think along with the polymers in there, they contribute to the sliiiightly velvety finish after application. But it's very subtle, and there no film or layer formed over the skin at all. \n\n#My thoughts\nI was super pleased when I pH tested it and the results were 3-4. Right at the sweet spot for efficacy of salicylic acid - even though the Amazon seller answered a pH question by saying it was 5.5 🙃. I purged almost immediately after starting use - nothing irritated, but I could see my clogged pores (of which there were quite a few that had made themselves at home) start to get a move on 😂\n\nMy skin has a pretty slow turnover rate, so I purged for at least three weeks - I'd say the period would last much shorter for most. \n\nI'm also delighted by the low price point, which belies the simple elegance of the texture. I didn't feel like the formulation cut corners, or like I was compromising in any way. They also cover all their bases with the label, including advising a patch test, warning not to use on broken skin, etc. which I appreciate. \n\nThey suggest using it 2-3 times a week at night, and recommend sun protection the next morning. Brand communication on point 👌🏽\n\nAll in all, very happy with the product. Would recommend to anyone looking for a basic, affordable, effective BHA. Finally, a 2% salicylic serum I can recommend to beginners! 😤❤\n\nEdit: I just bought a second bottle of this, having run out -  it was dispensing product without having to poke the nozzle 🤔 Did I poke it unnecessarily? Do some of them not dispense for some reason? Who knows 😂 Lemme know of your experience with Disrupt packaging if you try  it! TIA!",

Technically, you can use a BHA once a week or so, depending how many times you're using tretinoin, whether your skin is still getting used to it, etc. But it depends on your skin's condtion and your rouinte. That's why it's best to ask your derm first, instead of risking over-exfoliating and causing skin barrier damage.\n\nIf your skin is still sensitive from starting tretinoin, then no, using salicylic acid is not a good idea. I'd suggest using a 5% or 10% niacinamide serum instead ☺️ Safe for daily use, can be layered with retinoids no problem, strengthens and supports skin barrier and helps manage irritation. Can help calm existing acne and purging.",

They have spread from there to the sides of my face and chin, and since then have randomly disappeared from my forehead but have remained everywhere else. I have tried switching my shampoo, laundry detergent, toothpaste, and using a clean towel over my pillow every night. I have changed my entire routine slowly and completely multiple times. I have not found a permanent routine yet because I keep thinking it's a product causing the cc's. I am starting over on a new routine, and am just so frustrated and don't want to keep buying new products.\n\ncurrent routine (I'm still patch testing and building):\n\nAM\n\nsplash with water + konjac\n\nLootatMe Jelly Sunscreen\n (ingredients: Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Orchid Extract, Crinum Asiaticum Extract, Dendrobium Phalaenopsis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Butylene Glycol, Betaine, Carbomer, Polyoxyethylene Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, 1, 2 - Hexanediol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Perfume)\n\nPM\n\nOCM with argan oil + cromollient SCE (have also tried hemp and mineral in the past)\n\nInnisfree anti-trouble gel cleanser \n\nBenton Snail Bee High Content Skin (patch testing) \n\nAnd I have EltaMD PM Therapy moisturizer to add in a couple weeks. I have large pores and used to have oily skin, although recently it has been a little flaky.  I have tried using H&S shampoo and noble zinc soap, thinking they may be fungal, but without any help. I have also used Paula's Choice AHA gel and BHA liquid, but they did not seem to affect them very much. In fact, the AHA created more cc's and the BHA caused me to break out in cysts. \n\nIs there any way cc's without any inflamed acne could be hormonal? I am not on BC. Or any other ideas? ",

It is the case sometimes but there are many cases where they're caused by the pore being clogged by sebum and dead skin cells, either because of an overproduction of sebum and/or your skin being bad at shedding skin cells effectively/'sticky' skin cells. for me, my closed comedones are hormonal (diagnosed hormonal by several derms bc of timing and placement), hormones classically causing an overproduction of sebum and those 'sticky' skin cells i mentioned. If chemical exfoliation didn't work for you you should consult a derm. Retinoids are usually prescribed for ppl with closed comedones. Retin-a reduced mine a lot but I still get them.

This was the answer I was looking for. :)\n\nThe BHA I used for two months with constant new cysts and not much else, while the AHA I did not give much time to, I only used it 4 times, due to the increase in cc's. I had tried cutting out fatty alcohols, and OCM has been a rather recent addition. However, you answered my main question! I have only been able to find people blaming hormones for cystic acne, which I do not get. But the cc's I get are all concentrated in my \"beard\" area. They are there the whole month, but definitely have fluctuations of better or worse. I have thought I might have imbalanced hormones for other reasons as well and have an appointment with an endocrinologist Monday. Glad to hear it may not be a product causing them!",

Although even 'non comedogenic' things can break people out, id review all the stuff youre using on yr face on that website to make sure youre not using anything with super comedogenic ingredients. i cut out all the slightly comedogenic stuff i was using and still continued to get cc's. i went straight on retin-a and that helped and ive recently incorporated chemical exfoliation (both a BHA and AHA) and that's also helped a little although i see that wasnt the case for you. mind you you may not have a hormonal imbalance even though youre getting hormonal acne - many women don't have a hormonal imbalance but still get hormonal acne due to sensitive androgen receptors in the skin, aka the skin is sensitive to hormonal fluctuations/the androgens you have even if theyre at normal levels. that's what i was told by my endocrinologist. the treatment for it is also a birth control (something like yaz or yasmin which has anti androgen properties) and/or spironolactone which is also an anti androgen. ofc its super important to check that yr hormones are normal!

I actually was prescribed differin and have it but I wanted to get a solid routine down with moisturizers and sunscreen before I started. Because I thought it was a product causing them I kept changing my sunscreens and moisturizers and kept putting off the differin. Although now I may just stick with what I have and start the differin. Thank you! :)",

    "body": "Gastritis was one of the worst experiences of my life. I know so many of you guys struggle too so I’m sharing some things that helped me. \n\nIt started during a stressful time in July 2020. We were moving and raising 2 kids under 4 during a pandemic. I had just rebounded from postpartum depression and still suffering from insomnia. I was stressed, anxious, and drinking espresso 2-3 times a day to keep me awake and energized to pack and keep up with the kids. I was also taking lots of ibuprofen for headaches that were a result of all the things I mentioned. I started getting reflux but had no time to deal with whatever was causing it so I took more ibuprofen for the pain. 🤦‍♀️ Fast forward to January/February 2021 I was a total disaster. Couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, anxiety was insane, I lost 25 lbs and my marriage was crumbling.\n\nIt was a dark time but thing are so much better now!!! Don’t lose hope. After an endoscopy I reluctantly started Nexium after my GI dr recommended it.  It helped with some of the chest pains but not the nausea and anxiety. I added zinc carnosine, l-glutamine, and DGL before every meal and as needed for supplements. I started taking Trazadone to help me sleep which helped my mind state a lot. My biggest breakthroughs were when I started religiously taking Carafate 3-4 times a day, (I even carried it with me in my purse), Aloe Vera juice on an empty stomach before bed, and anti-anxiety medication to calm me the fuck down.\n\nI honestly wish I had started the anxiety meds sooner because for me the anxiety definitely made EVERYTHING WORSE. \n\nI hope this helps someone. I can now pretty much eat whatever I want as long as I don’t eat too much at once. I’m still working through some reflux but the stomach pain, nausea and other awful gastritis symptoms are gone. I can even have a small cup of coffee daily but I do NOT take ibuprofen.",

Long story but I was not planning to get pregnant because I wanted to be sure I was better and off meds before but I had an IUD and got pregnant anyways so here I am. I would t recommend it but I am doing ok. I was very scared my symptoms would come back and I’m only in the second trimester so I don’t know how I’ll fare with reflux when baby is pushing on my stomach but so far I’m doing ok. I’m still Nexium twice a day unfortunately and my anxiety got much better when I got pregnant. Thank goodness because I had to stop my anxiety meds. It was scary but I’m doing ok and lucky that I was healed so much when it happened. Hopefully after baby I can get off the Nexium. I also still take the Trazadone to sleep.

I am in no way affiliated with Chiseled Face, Groomatorium Inc, or /u/chiseledface. One time, Ron gave me a tub of CF Banana, but that was because he wanted to clear out inventory, I had already bought some other soap from him, and also because I promised to fulfill its destiny with a Banana Roam shave. I think Ron is a good dude and I miss visiting his store. These are my personal biases and I own them.\n______________________________\n\n\n**Soap Background:**\n-\n\nOn March 14, 2017 /u/chiseledface released his first collaboration with Chris Bartlett, perfumer of [Zoologist](https://www.zoologistperfumes.com/). WIth the launch of the highly coveted [Rhinoceros](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/608/), a beutiful partnership was born. Over the past two years, they have released eight soaps in this line: Rhino, Panda, Civet, Macaque, Nightingale, Camel, Hummingbird, and Elephant (I believe in that order, but I don't remember).\n___________________________________\n\n**Ingredients:**\n-\nStearic Acid, Aloe Vera Juice, Beef Tallow, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Glycerin, Fragrance, Mango Butter, Avocado Oil, Silk Powder\n\n________________________________\n**Official Notes:**\n-\n\nTop Notes: Tree Leaves, Darjeeling Tea, Magnolia\n\nHeart Notes: Cocoa, Coconut Milk, Incense, Jasmine, Woody Notes\n\nBase Notes: Amber, Musks, Patchouli, Sandalwood\n_____________\n**Availability:**\n-\nLimited run of 80. Price is $36.85. Stock is split between:\n\n[Chiseled Face](https://chiseledface.com/products/chiseled-face-and-zoologist-elephant-shaving-soap?_pos=2&_sid=6f9f18c96&_ss=r) (Free shipping at $35)\n\n\n\n[Groomatorium](https://groomatorium.com/products/chiseled-face-and-zoologist-elephant-shaving-soap?variant=30904735465515) (Free shipping at $60, but larger selection)\n\n__________________________________\n\n**Packaging:**\n-\nI wouldn't normally review this, but as a luxury product, packaging is kind of important. I love the labels [[Top]](https://imgur.com/Rv8A2Hb) [[Side]](https://imgur.com/qP5DcFs) on this line. There's a nice, uniform aesthetic to the soaps and perfumes. The gold on black looks elegant, and I would feel comfortable displaying these on a shelf in my bathroom. The violet glass is heavy and sturdy. As dumb as it sounds, the jar *feels* nice. When you see/hold it, this soap tells you that it's a luxury item. Considering the price, I'm glad that so much thought was put into presentation.\n\n________________________\n\n**Guywiththepants *PROFESSIONAL* Scent Notes:™**\n-\n\nThis line of soaps is insane. To my plebeian nose, it is nearly impossible to pick out individual notes. They all blend together to make some sort of super scent; I love it!\n\nI definitely get sandalwood, but under that there is a definitive sweetness, cocoa, but NOT chocolate, and very light. Mixed in with that, lurking in the background is this sort of dense, rich, incense/tea/woody smell that I lack the words to describe. It's none of the notes individually, but all three at once. Overall, I quite like this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhere would I rank it in comparison to other Zoologist soaps? I'd say it's middle of the road. Yes, I have a [tier list...](https://imgur.com/wDGV0aV)\n\nRhino, Panda, Civet, Elephant, Macaque, Nightingale, Hummingbird, Camel\n_________________________\n**Scent Strength: 10/10 (For a soap)**\n-\nIf you're looking for cologne, look elsewhere. However, I will say that the scents in this line last longer than any other soaps I own. It comes on like an aftershave and stays that way for 20ish minutes after the shave. Over the course of the next few hours, I'll catch whiffs here and there, but nobody else really seems to notice. I'm a teacher, and I have only been called out twice while wearing Rhino (the strongest of these scents). Both times were when I sat down next to colleague who said I smelled nice.\n\n__________\n**Performance: 8/10**\n-\nI must admit that while this soap is lovely, it can be tough to dial in. There is a very small margin of error when it comes to water:soap ratio. This soap is texturally unique. It's a sort of [soft, doughy, croap](https://imgur.com/QTq0bfk).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo hit this sweet spot, I recommend a fairly dry brush. When properly loaded, the soap will clump up and look [a bit grainy](https://imgur.com/XsmQAQT). From here, SLOWLY add water. You're shooting for [this texture](https://imgur.com/OX4s07s). I know it looks a bit dry, but trust me, this is dense, pillowy, silky goodness. You might be tempted to shoot for something more slick, but that's a mistake. You'll end up with [something like this](https://imgur.com/hm9jEKF). Yes, it will grant you slickness, but it will ruin the glorious cloud of cushion that makes this soap great. If you start with a wet brush or take it too far, the soap will break down and you'll end up with [sadness](https://imgur.com/nCRv9fT).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it. This soap is a princess, BUT treat her right and you shall be rewarded.\n______________\n**Post Shave: 8/10**\n-\nLeaves my face feeling smooth, but every so slightly dry. I really wish there was an aftershave to go with the soap, but obviously that would cut into perfume sales.\n_________________\n**The Verdict:**\n-\n\nPricey, but worth it. Difficult, but manageable. I would not recommend this soap to a beginner or to a budget conscious individual, but if the scent sounds nice and you can justify the cost, go for it! Obviously, I am a fan. Although Elephant is not my favorite soap, it makes a fine addition to [the collection.](https://imgur.com/wDGV0aV)",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the 7th installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Chiseled Face Groomatorium Trade Winds](https://i.imgur.com/oiyv5aY.jpg)\n\nTrade Winds is the first soap I'm trying out that isn't either explicitly marketed as a dupe or even an homage? The soap uses Old Bay as a base but then adds extra layers to it. u/chiseledface doesn't even describe the soap as anything but an aquatic scent, which, Old Spice - despite the prominent boat on the brand - isn't really one of. As such, the goal here, obviously, wasn't really to duplicate Old Spice but play around with it to find something new.\n\nTo do this the soap layers notes of cucumber, ocean, ozone, and mint on top of the Old Spice base. I say on top because that really is what it feels like. Taking whiff is like smelling Old Spice with other scents over it. The cucumber hit me the most on the puck but they're definitely all there, including the unmistakable base of Old Spice. The mint probably is the hardest to pick up, only come out to play every so often and really only when I'm thinking, \"Can I smell the mint?\"\n\nThe soap itself is beef tallow-based and pretty soft. I scooped it easily with my finger and it felt like a slightly firmer cream cheese, which is, I'm sure, what any soap maker wants their soap compared to.  The rest of the ingredients include Stearic Acid, Aloe Vera Juice, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Glycerin, Fragrance, Mango Butter, Avocado Oil, Silk Powder.\n\nIf you'd like to read my first shave with the soap you can find them here (I didn't record the second): [Shave 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/u2jjjm/comment/i4kdyo5/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**Oldness: 2**\n\nSince Trade Winds' goal wasn't to duplicate Old Spice it obviously isn't going to get that high a rating here. It, in fact, succeeds very well at not smelling like an Old Spice dupe, so good job all around on achieving the goal but failing at duplication. I am, however, giving it a two as the base behind the scent of Old Spice does indeed smell like Old Spice. Because of all the other layers to the scent it's hard to actually unpack the base scent in detail but it is, without a doubt, Old Spice. The top layers even die down a bit once lathered and you're left with a bit more Old Spicey scent.\n\n**Spiciness: 4**\n\nHonestly, this scent is just fantastic if you like Old Spice and for that alone it would get a good score but it also plays so well with teasing out scents I didn't realize played into Old Spice. What is really interesting is how the \"sea air\" scents really pull out aspects of Old Spice's scent. On the initial whiff of the puck I thought this wouldn't be my favorite but as I lathered and smelled the soap more I started picking up on how the new scents were actually accentuating the classic scent. Sometimes when I shaved I'd get cucumber and the watery side of Old Spice and other times the ozone would play more and I'd discover a nautical aspect to the scent I hadn't thought of before. I'm not a scent nerd but the work on this scent makes me talk like one.\n\n[**Lather: 3**](https://i.imgur.com/FgDybq4.jpg)\n\nChiseled Face blows up quickly and easily but I struggle to dial it in throughout my shaves, never getting it into the slick, creamy puffiness I wanted. It often just felt kind of a bit too thin. I think it's in there, for sure, as I got a lot of variance between latherings. It definitely needs a lot of water, I found. Precision lathering was almost too slow and I spent a good amount of time follow-up lathering on my face. There the soap eventually got to a good, if not great, lather, but it takes some work. I think, eventually, I'd get this right where I wanted but as it stands it's a perfectly decent lather that is easy to get big but hard to nail down.\n\n**Shave: 4**\n\nUsually, when I'm shaving for this I really concentrate on the soap feel and how my blade is moving on my face but with Trade Winds I kept forgetting to do that. That's a good thing! There is a saying with movie scores that the best ones make you forget they're there because they're so much part of the movie. Trade Winds does that but with soap! You don't think about the slickness because the slickness just works, you don't think about the cushion because it's just there. I'm only downgrading it a point because the soap does have to get there and on some shaves I just couldn't get it there and then I would be thinking about it.\n\n**Post: 5**\n\nTrade Winds goes on the face soft and leaves the fast soft. Part of the \"forgetting about it\" aspect is also the fact that you don't feel like you had something on your face after using it. My skin felt nice and soft afterward, though not as well moisturized as some other soaps I've used. It works even better mingling with the Old Spice aftershave, especially the new one. The cucumber and sea air scents last a bit longer than the base of the soap does and so throughout the day you get hits of those scents dancing around with the aftershave and it is, honestly, wonderful. This might be my favorite post-shave scent so far.\n\n**Final Verdict: 17**\n\nThe final score may seem kind of low but since this is partially a duplication scale there was no way to avoid that because this isn't actually a dupe. What Chiselled Face has done here, though, is wonderfully play with the Old Spice scent and make something built off it. I don't think many people out there are doing that and I really like it. The soap is a solid base that provides a stellar shave, I just wish it was a bit easier to really get it into the kind of lather I want. However, if you're a fan of Old Spice but want to switch it up a bit I couldn't recommend this enough.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller, family Xanthorrhoeaceae) is a perennial green herb with bright yellow tubular flowers. It shows antibacterial, anti-oxidant, antiviral, antitumor, antiarthritic, antirheumatoid, anticancer, and antidiabetic, antifungal property.               \n\nIt has different names in different languages such as Hindi name(Gheekuvar), Marathi name(korfad), English Name(Ind[..................................read more](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2020/10/aloe-vera-commonly-known-as-barbados-or.html)\n\n￼\n\n\n\nVitamin and mineral content\n\n• Vitamins: A, C, E, B12, B complex, Choline\n\n• Minerals : calcium, copper, selenium, magnesium, manganese, potassium, sodium, zinc, chromium. \n\n• Enzymes : aliiase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, bradykinase, carboxypeptidase, catalase, cellulase, lipase, and peroxidase.\n\n                 - Bradykinase helps to reduce excessive inflammation when applied to the skin topically, while others help in the breakdown of sugars and fats.\n\n• Anthraquinones : It provides 12 anthraquinones, which are phenolic compounds traditionally known as laxatives. \n\n                 - Aloin and emodin act as analgesics, antibacterials and antivirals.\n\n• Fatty acids : It provides 4 plant steroids; cholesterol, campesterol, β-sisosterol and lupeol. \n\n                 - All these fatty acids have anti-inflammatory action and lupeol also possesses antiseptic and analgesic properties.\n\n• Hormones : Auxins and gibberellins that help in wound healing and have anti-inflammatory action.\n\n• Sugars : It provides monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) and polysaccharides (glucomannans/polymannose).

So, it is very useful in treating atherosclerosis (blood vessels clogged with clot and fat deposition).\n\n\n2) For constipation, 10 gram pulp of aloevera paste is made with rock salt, mixed well and then boiled(to evaporate the water content). Take this once a day.\n\n\n3) Aloe Vera leaf is heated on burning charcoal, cuticle is removed and pulp is scraped and squeezed in cloth to get the juice. One teaspoon of this juice is added with two drops of ghee and 4 drops of honey and licked hourly to relieve attacks of breathlessness and wheezing.\n\n              \n4) Healing effect : polysaccharide, and gibberellin, a growth hormone, interacts with growth factor receptors on the fibroblast, thereby stimulating its activity and proliferation, which in turn significantly increases collagen synthesis after topical and oral Aloe vera. Aloe gel not only increased collagen content of the wound but also changed collagen composition (more type III) and increased the degree of collagen cross linking. Due to this, it accelerated wound contraction and increased the breaking strength of resulting scar tissue. An increased synthesis of hyaluronic acid and dermatan sulfate in the granulation tissue of a healing wound following oral or topical treatment.\n\n            > Wound healing is a dynamic process, occurring in 3 phases. The first phase is inflammation, hyperaemia and leukocyte infiltration. The second phase consists of re-moval of dead tissue. The third phase of proliferation consisting of epithelial regeneration and formation of fibrous tissue.\n\n            - The leaf pulp is useful to heal burn wounds, boils, acne, blisters, allergic skin disorders.\n\n            - Its pulp is added with turmeric powder and heated for a minute and this is applied externally(acne, wound, allergic skin) and internally on mouth ulcer(2-3 times a day).\n\n              .\n5) Oil prepared with Aloe Vera in sesame oil base is very useful against diaper rashes.\n\n             \n6) Skin protection effect from uv and gmma ray exposure : Aloe vera gel has been reported to have a protective effect against radiation damage to the skin. An antioxidant protein, metallothionein, is generated in the skin, which scavenges hydroxyl radicals and prevents suppression of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the skin. It reduces the production and release of skin keratinocyte-derived immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and hence prevents UV-induced suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity.\n\n                 - Aloe Vera juice is good for stomach, skin diseases.\n\n\n7) Anti-inflammatory action : Aloe vera inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway and reduces prostaglandin E2 production from arachidonic acid. With this, the novel anti-inflammatory compound called C-glucosyl chromone was isolated from gel extracts.\n\n\n8) Laxative effects : Anthraquinones present in latex are a potent laxative. It increases intestinal water content, stomach upset, stimulates mucus secretion and increases intestinal peristalsis.\n\nIntake : Take Aloevera juice regularly in early morning on empty stomach.\n\n\n9) Moisturizing and anti-aging effect : Mucopolysaccharides help in binding moisture into the skin. Aloe stimulates fibroblast which produces the collagen and elastin fibers making the skin more elastic and less wrinkled. It also has cohesive effects on the superficial flaking epidermal cells by stick[..................................read more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference :\n\nIndian Journal Of Dermatology ; 2008; 53(4): 163–166.\n\nNatural Medicine Journal ; September 2012 Vol. 4 Issue 9 \n\nThe Review on Properties of Aloe Vera in Healing of Cutaneous Wounds; Volume 2015 |Article ID 714216 : \n\nAloe vera: An Ancient Herb for Modern Dentistry—A Literature Review; Volume 2014 |Article ID 210463 \n\nNCBI\n\nPUBMED \n\nJournal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine.

    "body": "Mickey Lee Soapworks (MLS) is an artisan that specializes in small batch handmade soap, aftershave, preshave products, bath products and lip balms.. Samantha (/u/Sammy_Lee) and Eric McDaniels (/u/Mickey_Lee) have been occupying the artisan space for a over a year now and continue to impress with their soap scents and hip style. Both are active participants in the shaving community and are easily accessible and a pleasure to speak with. I encourage you to read their full [“About”](http://mickeyleesoapworks.com/about/) section of their website for a deeper look at who is behind this amazing company. MLS can be purchased directly from their [website](http://www.mickeyleesoapworks.com/) or from third party retailers such as [Maggard Razors](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-category/soaps-creams/mickey-lee-soapworks/).   \n\nAs always, I will provide my complete honest review and I have not received any compensation or preferential treatment for my review. This is strictly for the community to use as a tool in making informed decisions. Most importantly, these are my opinions and mine alone. If you do not like them or disagree with them, I respect that and ask that you do the same.  \n  \nPlease note that I often review products from the same artisan and to save myself time, the introduction, packaging and lather may be identical or slightly tweaked. The uniqueness normally will be found in scent, price and overall.  \n\n**Packaging:**  \n\nMLS Souq comes in a opaque polypropylene tub with a solid white screw top lid. The product weight is 3.3 oz which leaves the obligatory room to lather the soap directly from the tub without throwing protolather everywhere. The top label, the only label on the soap, is waterproof and is very elegant. It contains the company name, soap name, ingredients and website address. Packaging score 9.4/10.  \n\n**Lather:**  \n\nSouq is offered in MLS’s special edition tallow base. This base is noticeably better than the already very good standard base. This soap loads quickly and effortlessly into the brush and rewards the user with a very rich creamy lather, that is both cushiony and slick. The post shave feel is great, as can be expected from a tallow based soap made from fine ingredients. I have spent quite a bit more time of late with MLS soap and have really hit my groove lathering it up and dialing it in. The stuff is really amazing once you are able to get it where you like it in terms of hydration. Lather score of 10/10.  \n\n**Scent:**  \n\nSouq is one of the most unique scents available in the artisan space right now. It’s base is the note of fig, which is sweet and slightly ligneous. The sweetness is a natural sweetness because fig is a fruit cultivated from the *Ficus carica*, an asian flowering plant in the mulberry family. This natural sweetness is grounded by a myriad of middle eastern spices and a subtle musky note. To my nose, I can pick out the clove, cinnamon and ginger spice. The resulting fragrance is both warming and palatable. The soap as described by MLS themselves is as follows: *”Opening sharp notes of animal musk, like the many perfume stalls lining the streets and malls. Sweet dried figs, like the ones piled high in the markets.  And warm, rich spice notes of tumeric, cloves, cinnamon, bay leaves, pepper, and ginger; like the ones carefully arranged in artful pyramids in the souqs (open air markets) in Manama, Bahrain.”* The scent is mid to strong off the puck and remains this way once lathered up. Scent score 9.5/10.  \n\n**Price:**  \n\nFor $18.00 you get 3.3 oz of soap, this is soap comes in at $5.45/oz. The ingredients list is as follows: Stearic Acid, Tallow, Coconut Milk, Aloe Vera Juice, Coconut Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Kokum Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Glycerin, Lanolin, Shea Butter, Avocado Oil and Fragrance.. As a note, the artisan market in general has settled in recently in the $3.50-$4.00/oz price point for tallow based soaps. Coupling the price per ounce and the ingredients list, I give the Price score 8.5/10.  \n\n**Bottom Line:**  \n\nMLS Souq is the type of soap that can carry an artisan forward. This soap is bold and unique and sets MLS apart with respect to scent offering. If you can only own one MLS soap, which would be a shame, this is the one to have. The stellar performance of the SE base also aides to setting this soap apart from the pack. I applaud Samantha and Eric for their foresight and ability to bring something completely fresh to a market that is quickly reaching saturation. MLS Souq gets an overall score of 9.7/10.",

For low price, it was a pretty good buy.\n\n**Repurchase:** WRP\n\n**2) [Vitamin C + E Super Bright Sunscreen SPF 50+++](https://www.nykaa.com/dot-key-vitamin-c-e-face-sunscreen-with-spf-50-pa/p/13199519?skuId=8380668&se=0)**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 445 for 50g (Got 2 D&K sunscreen for Rs. 374/- from firstcry during Fomo sale)\n\n**🥵Climate:** Currently using in humid summer heat \n\n**Texture:** Watery fluid\n\n**👃Fragrance:** Claims to have none.\n\n**Claims:** 100% No White Cast\n\n**🧪Ingredients:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Glyceryl Citrate/Lactate/Linoleate/Oleate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta Vulgaris Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Terminalia Ferdinandiana (Kakadu Plum) Fruit Extract, Citrus Sinensis (Blood Orange) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid \n\n**My Experience:** I'm currently using this Sunscreen, mostly for reapplication.I also apply it on hands for reapplication. \n\nIt has pretty much protected me from tanning, but the only problem is that it pills if not blended properly. \n\nI know you might say all sunscreen pills if not rubbed or applied properly, but I've used many sunscreen, which even when applied in rush, didn't pill. Can't say the same for this sunscreen. \n\nIt's not sweat proof or water proof, and can burn your eyes if you accidentally rub them before the product seeps into your skin. I wouldn't recommend it for oily skin too, as it feels greasy.\n\nThe product does its job of protecting against sun, but I haven't been out for longer hours after applying it. Plus, reapplying it while being out under the sun might lead to pilling. The positives are that it has no white cast, is affordable and might work for dry skin.\n\n**Repurchase:** No\n\n\n",
