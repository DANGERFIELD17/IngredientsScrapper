    "body": "I was so excited when I finally figured it out that I thought it would be appropriate to share it with others. I have personally been struggling with bad breath since I was 10 years old for several reasons.\n\nWhen I was 10, I had tonsil stones and didn't really know what they were. At that age, I thought that it was food coming back up, so I ignored it for 6 years, until I did my research in high school. I removed them myself thinking that it would help, but it actually made it worse. I was bullied by others who continuously commented \"Your breath smells like sh\\*t.\" At that point, I begged my mother to take me to an ENT and scheduled an appointment to get my tonsils removed. The doctors told me that they should have been removed years ago because they were \"highly infected.\" After I got them removed, I thought I was home free to continue brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash with no bad breath. WRONG!\n\nAfter I got my tonsils removed, I still had bad breath. I researched again and decided to buy a tongue scrapper, but it didn't work. I was at a standstill again for about another couple of years until I looked up that the ingredient in most toothpaste was sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which can dry your mouth out. I did have dry mouth, so I started focusing on buying toothpaste without that ingredient. I also started using alcohol free mouthwash, and it still didn't work. I was back on the path of spending lots of money buying different products that had no effect on me.\n\nI later researched that post nasal drip could cause bad breath, which I had. I went to the doctor, and they told me to buy over the counter nasal spray. I used it thinking that it was all over. NOPE!\n\nFrom there, I thought that everything was coming from my stomach because my oral health was not the problem at this point, so I started eating healthy foods in hopes that it would help, but it didn't.\n\nThen, I started flossing after every meal, and it only helped temporarily, so I knew there was another problem.\n\nI kept reading forums online about people who cured their bad breath, and I read across someone who said that they started using oral probiotics that contained BLIS M18. I bought several bottles hoping that this would finally be my eureka... It wasn't. That, too, was also a temporary solution.\n\nAfter everything I tried, I thought there was no hope for me, but then I came across the post that talked about using diluted hydrogen peroxide (HP) as a mouthwash. My dentist makes me use diluted HP every time I came in, so I figured it was safe. I brushed and flossed like I normally did and then swished to solution in my mouth, even brushed it on my tongue, and IT WORKED! I finally had a long term effect. For the rest of the day, my breath was fine. I didn't think it was possible. Then, the next morning, I woke up with very little morning breath when it's usually very bad in the morning. I don't use the solution daily, only when I feel the need to. I'm hoping that my post will reach someone because I have struggled with this for most of my life, and it has really dampened my confidence, but not anymore. If I can figure it out, then you can too.\n\nEDIT: OMG! Thank you guys for the support! I honestly didn't think this would get this much recognition lol\n\nFor those wondering, I used half and half for the HP solution. I literally bought the store brand kind, and it worked for me. I used to 3% in the brown bottle that you can buy in the store. You can dilute it more if you feel the need to. I also still use the oral probiotics occasionally. You can look up any online that have BLISH M18 in it. Most of them have good reviews.\n\nWhen it comes to the process, I floss and brush first. I personally use Sensodyne since it doesn't have SLS in it (at least the one I used). From there, I take the half and half solution and swish and gargle it for 30 - 45 seconds. Then, I rinse it with water to make sure it's all out. I also put some on my toothbrush and scrub my tongue with it. Sometimes I use the chewable oral probiotics afterwards if I felt the need to.\n\nAlso, I don't smoke, I hardly drink coffee, I eat fairly healthy, I don't have diabetes or tonsils anymore, so some may have other issues than me.",

I definitely don’t want to worry anyone unnecessarily, especially because it seems to work long term for lots of people, but after a few weeks it started to become less effective for me: the odour started coming back and I had to start using it more and more regularly. Couple that with the grey area in terms it’s effects on dental health (enamel etc.) and I stopped using it. This may not be an issue for you, however if it is, about 2 weeks ago now I started using a new product: Therabreath mouthwash. You might have heard of it before, I’m not sure, but regardless I strongly recommend giving it a go. It’s working for me like almost nothing else has, and seems pretty safe and easy to use (no annoying dilution process like with hydrogen peroxide). Just wanted to mention in case this might help anyone! Good luck to all out there suffering with this shit, it sucks.",

    "body": "Recently I've seen a large influx of posts from people commenting that stopping all their products or missing out on their routine for a few days drastically improved their skin. With so many people reporting this, I figured making a trouble-shooting post about it for quick reference might really help! Maybe we can link to this post so these questions don't go unanswered while still prioritizing more rare or complex questions asked here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's LOOOTS of reasons why your skin may have improved with some down time, so here's some things to consider if (specifically) nothing has changed except discontinuing your routine! :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You may have been cleansing too often. Maybe your cleanser is actually a good choice for your skin, but using it twice a day is more than your skin needs. Try skipping out on the morning cleanse and aim for once a day at night time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your cleanser may be straight up too harsh. There's a lot of factors that can play into this, but if your skin feels tight, dry, 'squeaky clean', or uncomfortable after cleansing, it might be time to ditch that product. If you're looking for a more gentle or less drying cleansing method, consider the double cleanse! Start off with a non-fragrant oil to break everything down, and then go in with a gentle, fragrance free cleanser to whisk all that away. There's tons of posts on this sub addressing this method and providing product recs if you're interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You're using micellar water and not washing it off. I realize micellar waters are marketed as cleansers that don't require water, but leaving surfactants on your skin can cause dryness and irritation. If you're going to use a micellar water, it should be part of a two step cleanse - It's not an excuse to skip out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You're using makeup wipes. Cue the SCA police! /s. But seriously, same thing as micellar water - wipes are often irritating, tug and pull at the skin, and are fragrant. If you're going to use one, again, make it part of a two step cleansing process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- User error. This is an interesting one, but definitely a point to be considered. Actives are all the rage these days (and for a good reason), but it's really easy to get carried away. If these were in your routine, consider cutting down how often you  use them. If your skin is looking better with some down time, maybe it's because it's recovering from over-exfoliating or persistent exposure to (what is normally good) actives. This also applies to manual scrubs and cleansing tools! Another thing to consider is how actives play a role with other products and when and where they should be used in your routine. For example: Using a retinoid when your skin is still wet can enhance irritation, and using an occlusive (like vaseline) over a retinoid can increase penetration and lead to increased irritation. Consider a method called buffering, and search this sub for how to specifically use certain actives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your routine contains irritating or sensitizing ingredients. OOOOH boy. This is a long one, particularly because there's just so \\*many\\* things that can do this. But a good place to start evaluating ingredients is by checking for the following: Fragrance/parfum, alcohol, essential oils, fragrant plant oils, weird plant extracts (things like berries and flowers and shit),    methylchloroisothiazolinone (an irritating preservative), sodium lauryl sulfate, lanolin (which you can develop an allergy to), and dyes (particularly red dyes). Your product may also be formulated at an unsuitable pH. Checking for these things can get really overwhelming, but that's okay! Websites like Skincarisma and Cosdna break down individual product ingredients pretty well and can give you a good baseline when looking at a product. NOTE: Alcohol is not a bad ingredient!! But when you are specifically having problems, it's worth cutting out. NOTE: Fragrance is a no, regardless of whether you have a visible reaction to it or not. You can develop a fragrance allergy at any time. Fragrance has no place in skincare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You aren't wearing sunscreen. Yes, yes. We're vampires here at SCA. But seriously, using actives in a routine without sunscreen can really contribute to a multitude of problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- It's a you thing. This one sucks, but it's just the reality. Sometimes certain ingredients are generally well tolerated, but your skin alone reacts negatively to them. This is the case for me and coconut, jojoba, and rosehip oil, for example. Generally great ingredients, but they're just not for me. :( If you suspect a particular ingredient allergy/sensitivity, the only real way to verify this is to patch test. Everyone is different, and while studies can tell us what's generally not a good idea for our skin (fragrance, for example), a large part of skincare is trial and error.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- EDIT: You're using natural products, or you're DIYing something you shouldn't be. Sigh.. This one is sure to cause controversy, but hear me out. Natural is NOT better. Poison ivy is natural, but that doesn't make rubbing it on your face a good idea! The thing with 'natural' products is that many of them contain extracts (this kind of goes back to the sensitizing ingredient point). Plant extracts are not pure, single compounds (like glycerin, for example). These extracts consist of a conglomeration of different chemical compounds, and while a few of those parts may be good for your skin, a lot of those parts may not be. This is the advantage of having 'synthetic' products - you reduce the potential of having a reaction because there's fewer chemical compounds to interact with. The same applies to DIY skincare - just because you can eat it doesn't mean you should put it on your face. Also worth noting is that concentration of ingredients is vital when DIYing. Formulating is a complex science, but if you're set on making your own products (with substantiated science and actual commercial ingredients, I highly reccomend /r/DIYbeauty ). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Your skincare expired. CHECK EXPIRATION DATES PEOPLE!! I believe you can use  [http://www.checkfresh.com/](http://www.checkfresh.com/)  with a batch code to verify a product is still in a usable condition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf and when you decide to reintroduce your routine, I highly suggest going slow. One product at a time with patch testing (as hard as it is..). I personally think it's ideal to figure out your moisturizer game \\*first\\*, then your cleanser, and \\*then\\* your sunscreen. All in that order. Everything after that is supplemental anyway, and should be added in slowly once your baseline routine is established.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these considerations and resources help! These are just a few reasons that come to mind, but please feel free to comment anything else to add down below. :)",

I tried all popular brands of dandruff shampoos and conditioners including Neutrogena T-gel (tar shampoo) which was prescribed by a general physician.

Sulfate-free conditioners are very easy to find, and I switched to L'Oreal Sulfate-Free Everstrong shampoo at $6/bottle. Almost immediately, no more dandruff or itching! \n\nMore shampoos: http://www.sulfatefreeshampoobrandslist.com/\n\nEDIT: Another note, sodium dodecyl sulfate is also in many toothpastes. For a similar reason (drying or allergic reactiveness), it can cause canker sores in a person's mouth. If you have that trouble as I did, switch to a sulfate-free toothpaste as well. Sensodyne has some that are sulfate-free, but you must look at the ingredients.",

        "body": "I wrote about this a while back. Here's how I beat dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis):\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1gy1va/mfa_how_do_you_deal_with_dandruff/cap8s7o\n\nI've been fighting dandruff (sebhorreic dermatitis) my whole life. Some thoughts:\n\n- **Wash yourself!** Never buy into the hype that soap dries out your scalp. I mean, it does, but not as much as an oily scalp (yes, an oily scalp can lead to a dry scalp - more on that later). I take a night shower before bed, and I take a morning shower.\n\n- **Kill what's causing it.** SD is caused mainly by a yeast. Everyone has this yeast, but some just have it more strongly than others. The easiest way to kill the yeast is by using medicated shampoo. The big players are Pyrithione Zinc (Head & Shoulders), Selenium Sulfate (Selsun), Coal Tar Extract (Neutrogena T-Gel), and Salicylic Acid (Neutrogena T-Sal). \n\n- **Kill what's causing it, Part II.** There is a tiny mite that lives around the base of your hair. They will also dry out your skin. \n\n- **Yeast and Mites...so what?** When these things are there, they feed. They eat oil (sebaceous glands) and they drink water. As they multiply, they suck more and more water from you. The result is a dry, flaky scalp. When you have a VERY oily scalp, you run the risk of really growing these microorganisms. \n\n- **Establish a routine**. Generally, in the morning I ALWAYS use Pyrithione Zinc shampoo, then I rotate use of the other shampoos at night. \n\n- **Cut out sugars, watch your alcohol intake.** Sugars also feed the mites and yeasts. I'm not saying you need to do what I did, but I went on a keto diet (high fat, low carb) and my flaking is non-existent.\n\n- **Manage stress, stay healthy, exercise**. All these things mean good immune systems. Your immune system can play a role in making sure these critters don't wreak havoc on your scalp\n\n- **Facial Dryness**. Chances are you also have redness and dryness on your face. Clotrimazole (Tinactin) cream will help reduce this. Redness can be managed with Cortizone. \n\n- **See a dermatologist**. If none of this works, you need better antifungals, and maybe some steroid drugs. A dermatologist can help you.\n\n***\n\nSome will praise teatree oil. I tried using a teatree oil soap, and it didn't work well for me. Also, if you can, avoid soaps/shampoos with sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate. I know that's not always possible, but try. Usually the benefits of the medicine in a shampoo outweigh the risks of this particular chemical, but be advised. \n\nEDIT: Additionally - some are adamant about not shampooing at all. This also gives the side benefit of having the appearance of fuller hair....to some. My skin is so greasy that the flaking gets WORSE, and the greasiness forms hair clumps (thus exposing clumps of baldness). I went 10 days without shampooing and the flakes that came off weren't only huge, many of them were sticky and gross. Furthermore, my scalp was very itchy. \n\nVery oil hair types may experience this same issue when they don't shampoo.",

    "body": "Happened upon a guide from a dermatology magazine from ye olde days of circa 2004 which outlined in laymen's terms the core principles of cleansing and moisturizing for different skin types and conditions. These basic key points haven't changed in well over several decades, despite all the gimmicks and new breakthroughs. Thought it'd be an interesting read for both skincare newbies just embarking on their journey and enthusiasts alike. \n\n \n\n# Making the Choice\n\nEvery patient needs to cleanse and moisturize skin properly using suitable cleansers and moisturizers containing the appropriate ingredients. In patients with compromised or sensitive skin, proper cleaning and moisturizing is even more critical. Using too harsh a cleanser or an inappropriate moisturizer can, in many cases, exacerbate certain conditions and can cause contact dermatitis and other problems. \n\nThe plethora of cleansers and moisturizers available today makes it difficult to keep current with new ingredients and their actions — or to guide patients in the selection of these products. In addition, few trials have looked at cleansers and moisturizers and their therapeutic value. \n\n“Dermatologists must understand the ingredients in the products their patients use and what they do to or for the skin. However, the market changes quickly and it is very difficult to keep up,” says Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D., P.A., Clinical Associate Professor, in the Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest University. “They need to keep abreast of this as much as they keep abreast of any aspect of their medical practice by reading journals and going to meetings This aspect of the dermatology practice is just as important as any other since cleansers and moisturizers have a dramatic impact on the skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Moisturizer:**\n\nXerosis occurs when the water content in the skin is less than 10% to 20% — depending on the measurement method, and there is a loss of continuity of the stratum corneum. While moisturizers cannot repair skin, they can help restore the skin barrier and protect the skin as it heals. \n\n“Moisturizers need to stop water loss, decrease itching and burning, and make the skin feel smooth and soft,” says Dr. Draelos. “This creates an optimal environment for healing. Because the skin turns over every two weeks, healing can occur rapidly.” \n\nA good moisturizer should also be hypoallergenic, non-sensitizing, and non-comedogenic. The ingredients in moisturizers are often divided into occlusive agents, humectants, and emollients. \n\nOcclusive agents physically prevent or retard water loss. The most effective occlusive moisturizer is petrolatum. Lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones, such as dimethicone, are also very effective occlusive moisturizers. Applying an occlusive moisturizer immediately after bathing may be an effective way to trap additional water in the skin. \n\nHumectants attract and bind water and can improve the hydration of the stratum corneum. Effective humectants include propylene glycol, glycerin, urea, hyaluronic acid, and pyrrolidone carboxylate (NaPCA). However, high levels of humectants can draw water from surrounding cells and can actually dry the skin further. if not trapped by an occlusive agent. \n\nEmollients soften or soothe the skin by filling spaces between skin flakes and creating a smooth skin surface. They are usually light oily substances, such as octyl octanoate, sesame oil, grape seed oil, or cetyl stearate. Some emollients can also function as occlusive moisturizers. When combined with an emulsifier, the oily emollients are thoroughly mixed with the other water-soluble ingredients in the moisturizer. Emollients are probably the most important consumer ingredient in moisturizers since they provide the smooth skin feel associated with well-moisturized skin. \n\nMoisturizers may contain additional additives such as vitamins E, A, C, niacin, panthenol, peptides, polyphenols, aloe vera, and others. Alpha hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid or glycolic acid, may also be added to decrease cohesion of the excess stratum corneum cells, reducing roughness and scaling. The special ingredients are designed to function as cosmeceuticals imparting unique attributes to standard moisturizer formulations.\n\n Their final efficacy depends on how much of the ingredient is in the moisturizer and how the final formulation interacts with the skin. Despite their benefits, many patients resist using the most effective moisturizers since they often have unappealing characteristics. \n\n“Petrolatum is actually the very best moisturizer available, but it stains clothing, smells bad, and is greasy,” says Dr. Draelos. “Every other moisturizer on the market is trying to achieve the benefits of white petrolatum without the bad aesthetic effects.” \n\nAccording to Dr. Draelos, a good moisturizer should start with an occlusive agent, such as petrolatum or mineral oil, which is not as thick or greasy. It should also include occlusive ingredients that reduce greasiness, such as dimethicone, a type of silicone. \n\n“You might add grape seed, sesame, or some other lightweight oil and emollients, such as cetearyl alcohol,” says Dr. Draelos. “These are oils that can fit between the dry skin cells and make the skin feel smooth and soft.” It is also now possible to synthetically produce ceramides, which are some of the newest occlusive agents to enter the marketplace. \n\nDr. Draelos is excited about some of the newer developments in moisturizers. “The next generation of moisturizers are moisturizers used in a shower. Patients put the moisturizer on in the shower, and then rinse off. This novel technology effectively moisturizes the skin with long-lasting effects and is known as a new category of skincare products known as moisturizes.” *(These are available to us now.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Cleanser:**\n\nExcessive cleaning can damage the skin by washing out the natural humectant agents, change the pH value of the skin, and cause irritant contact dermatitis. \n\n“Cleansing damages the skin because the soap cannot distinguish between unwanted dirt and intercellular lipids,” says Dr. Draelos. “Synthetic detergents known as syndets are not as effective at removing dirt, but they do not remove as many intercellular lipids and are pH adjusted. A good alternative is the newer body washes that remove dirt, but leave behind a thin layer of petrolatum, especially if used with a puff.” \n\nWhen cleansing, all patients should use warm — not hot — water and bathe for not more than 10 minutes. Cleansing agents should be spread sparingly on the wet skin and, after briefly taking effect, completely rinsed off. \n\n“When looking for a cleanser, most patients should avoid cleaners with parabens, fragrances and detergents. Patients should also avoid detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,” says Leslie S. Baumann, M.D., Director of Cosmetic Dermatology at the University of Miami. “Ingredients to look for depend on the skin type, but acne-prone patients should look for cleansers with salicylic acid, while those with rosacea would look for sulfacetamide.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Acne** \n\nSome people with acne may try to stop outbreaks and oil production by scrubbing their skin and using strong detergent soaps and rough scrub pads. However, scrubbing will not improve acne; in fact, it can make the problem worse. Astringents are not recommended unless the skin is very oily, and then they should be used only on oily spots. \n\nPatients with acne should use a mild cleanser (5% benzoyl peroxide wash), once in the morning, once in the evening, and after heavy exercise. Acne suffers generally have oily skin, but the skin barrier can be compromised by treatment, leading to flaking and itching. \n\n“I recommend skin lubricants in the silicone family like cyclomethicone and dimethicone, which soften and hydrate without oils,” explains Mary Lupo, M.D., a dermatologist in private practice in New Orleans and professor of dermatology at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans. “Cleansers should be mild if on treatment, but high surfactant cleansers or those with salicylic acid are good for oily and acne-prone skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Eczema & Other Dermatoses** \n\nAny skin disease will benefit from a moisturizer that strengthens the stratum corneum barrier, even blistering bullous pemphigoid. Moisturizing with a good moisturizer is also very important for a disease such as psoriasis. \n\n“Since this is a disease characterized by hyperkeratosis, keratolytics can play an important role in its treatment. Propylene glycol and lactic acid can be sole, or integral parts, of treatment regimens by effectively removing adherent scales,” says Andrea Trowers, M.D., a pediatric dermatologist who has completed a fellowship in pediatric dermatology at the University of Miami. \n\n“Plastic wrap, plastic gloves or plastic shower caps can be used to occlude the affected area after application of a keratolytic, resulting in increased efficacy.” Patients with eczema usually have an impaired stratum corneum barrier so they can benefit from a moisturizer that will help replace cholesterol, ceramides, and fatty acids. The only skin diseases that generally do not benefit from a moisturizer are conditions that are skin manifestations of internal diseases such as skin cancer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Photoaged Skin** \n\nPhotoaged skin is generally treated with retinoids, which can dry the skin, especially during winter. For these patients, applying a moisturizer is helpful. The best moisturizing agent is petroleum jelly, but it is too greasy for most people, though a creamy version is available that is almost as moisturizing as the original. If other moisturizers are used, they should be the cream versions of the moisturizer. \n\n“Patients with photo-aged skin should avoid detergent cleansers with lots of surfactants. And they should look for added emollients like petrolatum to soothe,” explains Dr. Lupo. “Sodium laurel sulfate and many polysorbates can be very drying. Moisturizers with safflower oils and ceramide complexes are good. Humectants like glycerin are good as well.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ethnic Skin** \n\nPatients with darker skin tones, often referred to as “ethnic skin,” have special concerns. “Ethnic skin is generally no more or less sensitive than lighter skin and all the same precautions apply,” says Heather Woolery-Lloyd, M.D., Director of Ethnic Skin Care for the University of Miami Department of Dermatology. “However, ethnic or darker skin is subject to certain conditions not usually associated with lighter skin, such as hyperpigmentation following irritation.” \n\nIf a cleanser or moisturizer causes an irritation on a fair-skinned person, any redness heals and the skin returns to its normal appearance. However, a darker-skinned individual may be left with dark brown patches on their skin, which is especially bothersome if it occurs on the face. E\n\nExcessive scrubbing and harsh cleansers in patients with conditions such as rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis heighten susceptibility to irritation that can lead to hyperpigmentation. Those patients should use the mildest cleanser and least irritating moisturizers. \n\n“While it is difficult to specifically predict which individuals will be irritated by a particular ingredient, a dermatologist should make sure that patients use products with fewer known irritants,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Soapless cleansers are generally milder than traditional soaps and are especially useful in patients with sensitive skin prone to irritation. Additionally, traditional soaps combine with minerals in hard water and can leave an unwanted residue on skin and hair.” \n\nPatients with pseudofolliculitis barbae may find that cleansers with glycolic acid offer some relief. In addition, shaving gels with salicylic acid can be effective against in-grown hairs. However, these products can be very irritating and should not be used for individuals with sensitive skin. Another issue with darker skin is the ashy appearance of the skin when it becomes dry. While not necessarily a medical issue, it is still of concern to darker-skinned individuals. \n\n“Patients with dry, ashy skin will find products with lactic acid or urea to be effective,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Because they not only moisturize and hydrate the skin, but they also exfoliate the superficial dry scale.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Elderly Skin** \n\nSince elderly patients do not produce a lot of sebum, their skin is dry and prone to itchiness. As a result, the elderly need to be especially careful about skincare. They should wash less frequently and should avoid cleansers as much as possible, relying almost exclusively on warm, not hot, water to rinse away surface dirt. Mild soap, such as glycerin soap, should only be used for local cleaning of, especially soiled areas. The elderly should moisturize frequently, especially after bathing when the skin is still moist. Bath oil can also be used, but patients must be careful about slipping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Young Skin** \n\nMoisturizing is very important in pre-pubescent children since they do not produce a lot of sebum, and they generally get dirtier and require frequent bathing, which dries the skin. “As far as moisturizers, individuals with healthy skin can use most of the products. Just pick a product that leaves skin smooth, not tight or greasy,” says Dr. Lupo. “A combination moisturizer and sunscreen is an excellent choice because you can hydrate the skin and have the added benefit of preventing aging skin and skin cancers.” \n\n“Young children with ethnic skin who have dry skin — especially those living in colder climates — can relieve the dryness and alleviate the ashy appearance by using products like petroleum jelly or even vegetable shortening that has been refrigerated for a cooling effect,” says Dr. Trowers. \n\nOlder children often resist this approach because of the greasy feel, but products such as Cetaphil emollient cream can be almost as effective, with better cosmetic tolerance. According to Dr. Trowers, children of all skin types who suffer from atopic dermatitis often have more bacteria on the surface of the skin. More severe cases can be cleansed below the neck with chlorhexidine, or in milder cases with a product such as Cetaphil anti-bacterial soap, then bathed in a solution of Alpha Keri bath oil. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Understanding the Ingredients:**\n\nConsidering the difference that proper cleansing and moisturizing can make to dermatology patients, it is essential that every dermatologist understand the ingredients that go into moisturizers and cleansers — and the impact that those ingredients have on a patient’s skin. \n\n“Good practice in cleansing and moisturizing can make a significant difference for patients with certain skin conditions and as a therapeutic response to the side effects of medications used for treatment,” says Dr. Baumann. “It is very important for dermatologists and their patients to become familiar with the individual ingredients in moisturizers and cleansers and to know what they really do. Without this knowledge, you may not be able to respond appropriately because your patient has come in with an unfamiliar product, and you are unable to offer sound medical advice.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n*Source: The Dermatologist Volume 12,  Issue 6,  June 2004*",

    "body": "**Introduction (stop using 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 shit)**\n\nI've been putting off writing this because of the stigma that \"knowing\" or caring about your hair is \"gay\", I had to deal with this stigma as I tried to grow out my hair when I was 14. I don't think this is right and any male should be able to care about his hair without being having to worry about stigma. Everyone wants to have good hair; hair is a source of confidence for many men.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a professional, I'm just a normal guy who's done a lot of research because I was sick of having bad hair days.\n\nNatural hair and promoting your natural genetic tendencies is what I'm aiming to promote with this guide. [See this picture of me aged 14 vs aged 21.](https://i.imgur.com/RI4ejCj.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Basics (boring information stuff)**\n\nEven though hair cells are dead, your hair should be treated like a living organism. Certain things can be more damaging then beneficial; this means damaged hair will take time to repair.\n\nThe purpose of shampoo is to remove oil and dirt that is in your hair. Conditioner's purpose is to put back some oils to make it soft and managable for combing and styling. However, naturally your scalp produces oils that naturally condition your hair. These oils also become striped when you use certain shampoos ^(psst it's sulphates). Certain shampoos can be more damaging than others (as I will explain later).\n\nIf you shampoo too often your scalp will produce more oils in an attempt to restore equilibrium (balance). This means if you shampoo daily and stop suddenly, you will experience a rebound effect where your scalp is producing too much oil. The result can be oily hair, dandruff or an itchy scalp. In this case, it may be worth while to slowly reduce the amount of shampoo you use over a longer period of time. It's kinda like a drug in which you will experience withdrawals, you can go cold turkey and deal with an itchy scalp and dandruff for awhile or you can reduce your usage over time.\n\nConditioning hair seals in moisture and is normally used if your hair is too dry. This is why most brands recommend you use their conditioning product if you use their shampoo product.\n\n1. You can use a shampoo and conditioner\n2. You can use shampoo and not use conditioner (use as needed e.g. when you feel your hair is too dirty or too much build up)\n3. You can use conditioner and not use shampoo (called co-washing)\n4. You can use no shampoo at all (no shampoo relies on your scalp to reach that eventual balance, however this doesn't work for everyone)\n\nI use a combination, I shampoo when needed and I condition when needed. This is entirely up to you and **overall it can be all boiled down to**:\n\n* Use shampoo if your hair is too oily (build up)\n* Use conditioner if your hair is too dry\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Temperature**\n\nThe temperature of the water while you shower can dry out your skin, including your scalp. This can worsen dandruff and dry out your hair (loss of those oils my dude). Thus cold showers are actually better for your hair and skin, but who's going to do that? If you still want a warm shower, just adjust the temperature until it's as cold as you can manage. Just avoid hot and steamy (although relaxing) showers. If you do turn up that heat, just don't get your hair wet, I'm fucking serious.\n\nScientific reasoning is:\n\n1. hot = more energy\n2. more energy evaporates more stuff\n3. therefore dryness and itchy hell\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shampoo and Conditioner Products (it's all a scam)**\n\nOkay so most shampoo and conditioner products are a scam. They use the same chemicals.  L’Oreal, Aveeno, Garnier, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Dove, Head and Shoulders...ect. all use the same shit. Most shampoos use  **Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Sulfates)** while most conditioners use **silicones (ingredients ending with “-cone”)**.\n\n* Sulphates are bad because they strip natural oils, causing your scalp to become itchy and dry.\n* Silicones are bad because most silicone chemicals are not water soluable. This means that they build up in your hair.\n\nSulphate products are designed so that they can remove silicones from your hair. They are strong chemicals in that regard, thus this is why they are effective at treating dandruff. However it is in your best interest to not be held back by these hair drugs and you should only use every so often, with the goal of no usage *evennnntually.*\n\n* If you are making the switch from Sulphates/Silicones, you should do a reset wash by using a ***sulphate product that has no silicones***.\n\nYou will need to go to a pharmacy or a supermarket and look at products' ingredients list. Yes, this is where the effort comes in. Generally natural products will advertise that they are sulphate or silicone free. This will vary from location, country and region. It really just depends what you can find or order online. I will refer you to this [ultimate guide from /r/curlyhair](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6Dj9WAZxlfBhJSyS5on2rw3-if5cOV3oV-dQ3B0AHA/edit#heading=h.exb4a3d58zp), it has some suggestions but I just used the the first natural product I could find.\n\nGood products will cost more money, although if you use less (as I'm suggesting) you will only need to buy hair care products every 3-6 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hair Styling Products**\n\nThis is getting fucking long so you get dot points now.\n\n* Your natural oils act as product, style while your hair is wet and let it naturally dry.\n* Look for water soluable products\n* If you use a hair dryer; a hair diffuser is an option to reduce further frizz (it's like naturally drying it but quicker)\n* Becareful of non-water soluable products as they might not be easily removed from your hair (only sulphate products may be able to remove them)\n* Touch your hair less as this produces more oils\n* Consider that different hair products are tailored to different hair types (curly, dry, damaged, voluming... ect)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know if this is general knowledge, so if it is... My bad lol. I didn't know most of this until recently. If there is anything to add comment it below. This guide will help any hair and promote a natural healthy style but it's more important the longer your hair is.\n\n**EDIT:** Another tip is not to go crazy on your hair with a towel when it's wet, but rather to pat dry it, as this can damage it.",

I blot my hair with a tshirt to get the excess water out and occasionally use the Umberto Giannini No More Frizz to help settle it down.

I work out every morning and shower right after, but I also do jiu-jitsu a couple times a week which involves a lot of rolling around, getting squished and lots of sweat. I kinda just shampoo twice a week, but idk the how to tell if my hair is getting gross from buildup in-between.\n\nShould I brush, and if so how often? My hair is kinda wavy to slightly curly, fine and pretty thick. Right now I'm just kinda pushing it back. I've been told by a couple people that I should try to go for the Jon Snow look.\n\nWhat's the best way to restyle it after it's been messed up? I said before, it's kinda thick. It'll tend to stay in whatever weird way it dried. Most of the time, it stays good, but sometimes I'll have some clump of it stick up on top of my head and I can't get it back down easily. Would a sea-salt spray be good for that, I hear people mention those a lot.\n\nI don't really systematically take pictures of my hair, sometimes just take a selfie if I have a day I feel like I'm looking good. [But here's an album of such shots over the past two months.](http://imgur.com/gallery/kxK8CmH) I know they're not really close ups of my hair so it might not be that useful lol, but figured I'd include them.\n\nI've been using American Crew shampoo and conditioner, the conditioner daily and the shampoo twice a week.

It’s often used as a detergent and is popular because of its cheap cost, lathering ability, and lack of impact on taste. However, it has been linked to mouth ulceration (canker sores). If you experience frequent mouth ulcers, check to see if your toothpaste contains Sodium lauryl sulfate. \\\n \\\nCitations:\n- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate\n- https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mouth-ulcers/",

    "body": "Hello all! So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn’t hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible. \n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!), niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae. This is my one non-negotiable skin care item.\n\n[**Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Eczema-Therapy-Moisturizing-Sensitive/dp/B003O7IBZC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-3&keywords=aveeno%2Beczema&th=1) \\- Super moisturizing. **Colloidal oatmeal**, glycerin, panthenol, petrolatum, a ceramide, dimethicone. (People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).) And [Aveeno Eczema Therapy Night Time Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Baby-Nighttime-Colloidal-Dimethicone/dp/B01HI7VY84/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-4&keywords=aveeno+eczema) for something heavier but has same ingredients. You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I’ve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

Are there any resources to either purchase make up without the ingredients she is allergic to or any sites that detail all of the ingredients listed in make up?\n\nThe most common thing she is allergic to in make-up is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which seems to be in everything.  She also has allergies to Glutaraldehyde, Carmine, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, and Thimerosal.  \n\nAny help is appreciated.  Thank you!!\n\n\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to take a minute to say thank you!  You have all been so helpful and have given me a ton of resources to explore.",

I'm curious.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWow, the response on this was incredible! Thank you all so much!\n\nSo the general consensus that I gathered from all of your comments is that even though only spitting the toothpaste out of your mouth (with no rinse) is the recommended method, especially for those prone to poor diets, cavities and weaker teeth....there's an overwhelming number of people who rinse not just because of preference but because that's how they were taught (it just seems logical - like washing soap off your body when you shower).\n\nThere are also a segment of people who prefer to rinse due to health implications such as mouth / canker sores from the Sodium laureth sulfate in toothpaste or the alleged long term negative effects of fluoride in your body (FYI - I don't personally believe that the amounts of fluoride in toothpaste is enough to be harmful even if you only spit and leave it on your teeth, but I would advise whoever reads this to do their own research, consult with their own dentists or physicians and make their own decisions).\n\nGoing forward, I think I'll try the spit method, but only at night before bed.

I’m not affiliated with any brand but I can see how some may feel negatively towards this, especially considering some of the history on the sub for brands to exploit the readers here. \n\nI may make a separate post later with recommendations as well as a bit of a discussion around it for people who are looking for recommendations. \n\n—-\n\nHi guys!\n\nYears ago I wrote[ the sidebar'd piece about dehydrated skin that I still get tagged in today](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/22c4tf/dehydrated_skin_and_the_moisture_barrier_an/). I wanted to update that with some more detailed information and knowledge on why it happens, what is happening, et cetra. Hopefully this can replace that guide, since I feel like it was a bit too broad. :)\n\n---\n\nDehydration is characterized by a lack of hydration in the cellular system and intercellular channels of the skin. It is not a skin type, but a skin condition. It does not discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin types, and is frequently aggravated by lifestyle and skincare choices. \n\nTo understand skin dehydration, you need to first understand the role of the natural moisturizing factors (NMF) in skin hydration. The NMF is an invisible lipid composition that sits on the top layer of the stratum corneum (SC) as well as interwoven in the top most layers of corneocytes (skin cells), making up a part in what is considered the \"acid mantle\" of the skin. The term NMF first appeared in 1959, but was not universally adopted immediately. It is hydrosoluable (able to dissolve in water) and hygroscopic (able to retain water), composed of about 40% free amino acids, 12% pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA), 12% lactates, 8.5% sugars/peptides/inorganic acids, 7% urea, 6% chloride, 5% sodium, and various small amounts of other materials. \n\nIt serves three major functions:\n\n1.  Protecting skin from damage\n2.  Encouraging desquamation (exfoliation of the upper most layer of corneocytes)\n3.  Controlling permeability of the SC\n\nThe NMFs are very effective natural humectants, drawing moisture to the skin from the atmosphere, even at humidity as low as 50%. \"Hydrated NMF forms ionic interacts with keratin fibers, reducing the intermolecular forces between the fibers and thus increasing the elasticity of the stratum corneum.\"² This keeps the skin healthy and supple in appearance. It also serves to prevent excessive water influx (see the third major function above), such as when your skin wrinkles from being in the bath or shower for too long, which causes the corneocytes to shrink. \n\nWhile it is often thought that the stratum corneum is \"dead\" tissue, it still requires water to function effectively. The NMF serves to provide for this, drawing and holding much of the water required. For example, enzymes that cause skin cells to exfoliate away naturally, by breaking the various bonds holding corneocytes together, need water to do their job effectively. \n\nReduction or stripping away of the NMF results in dry skin ([known as xerosis](https://imgur.com/vBOb07w)), scaling, flaking, as well as fissuring and cracking ([such as severely cracked and dry heels](https://imgur.com/C0F7BKK)). It can also result in what we refer to as \"dehydrated skin\" (though this is not a medical term).\n\n* * *\n\nWhat Dehydration Feels Like\n===========================\n\nDehydrated skin is one of the more difficult conditions to diagnose because it is frequently invisible. There are many \"tips\" online about how to diagnose dehydrated skin, such as pinching the back of your hand to see how quickly the skin snaps back into place. *It's important to keep in mind that this only serves to show if your body is dehydrated. Dehydrated skin usually has less to do about the hydration inside of your body and more to do with how we treat the skin topically or the atmosphere around us.* This is why someone with dehydrated skin can pinch the back of their hand and see their skin immediately pop back into place, yet feel horrible irritation on their skin when applying a simple moisturizer.  \n\n[The skin usually looks dry, scaly, or flaky](https://imgur.com/cLTwbTf), and feels \"tight\" (such as after using a harsh cleanser). When pulled very gently, [it can appear to crinkle](https://imgur.com/8RRFIfj) (not to be confused with crepey skin, such as the skin appearance around joints), and can even look like it has a very thin layer of skin sitting atop the upper most layer of skin. In some people, it feels itchy. It is usually most evident on the forehead or nose. It can also look lackluster, dull, and lack \"bounce\" and suppleness. In some, it can take the form of crinkly but very shiny skin, usually due to abuse of skin remodelers like AHAs or BHAs. \n\nBoth dry and oily skin types can be dehydrated - dry skin because it struggles to hold onto moisture and oily because sufferers frequently use harsh cleansers or astringents to gain relief. According to Milady's Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary, \"When oily skin becomes dehydrated, the surface layers of cells harden ... and block oil secretion. The result is an entrapment of the oils under the stratum corneum layer. This is particularly detrimental in the case of someone with acne because it also results in the entrapment of the infection.\"¹ \n\nDehydrated skin also typically responds more viciously to active ingredients, such as BHAs, AHAs, sulfur, retinoids, and vitamin C. It can also respond to completely benign ingredients, creating a burning sensation or the skin feeling flushed and hot.\n\n* * *\n\nCauses of Dehydration\n=====================\n\nThe most common culprits of dehydration of the skin is stripping cleansers, harsh soaps, and hot water, though a host of other causes can come into play for some people, including skin conditions that aggravate dry skin (again, while dehydrated skin is not the same as dry skin, dry skin is especially prone to dehydration) or create acne (which frequently causes people to \"overtreat\" the acne and strip their skin).\n\nSkin Conditions\n---------------\n\n*   Atopic dermatitis\n*   Irritant contact dermatitis\n*   Psoriasis\n*   Cutaneous lymphoma\n\nEnvironmental\n-------------\n\n*   Seasonal changes\n*   Dry air (low humidity)\n*   Flowing air (especially wind)\n*   UV radiation (tanning beds, the sun)\n*   Overwashing\n*   Age\n*   Sunburn\n*   Cigarette smoking and smoke exposure\n*   Friction (including harsh scrubbing and mechanical exfoliation tools like the Clarisonic)\n\nHeredity Disorders\n------------------\n\n*   Ichthyosis vulgaris\n*   Netherton syndrome\n\nHormonal\n--------\n\n*   Hypothyroidism\n*   Estrogen deficiency\n\nTopical\n-------\n\n*   Alcohol/isopropyl alcohol/SD alcohol/denatured alcohol\n*   Drinking alcohol\n*   Essential oils\n*   Clay masks\n*   Sodium lauryl sulfate\n*   Bar soap\n*   Astringents (particularly alcohol-based astringents)\n*   Topical medications (e.g. retinoids)\n*   Excessive AHA or BHA use\n\n* * *\n\nCaring for Dehydrated Skin\n==========================\n\nThe most important thing when solving dehydrated skin is consideration of the products you use as well as your environment. This means paying special attention to the ingredients label when shopping, being cautious about what is applied to the skin, and what your home environment is like (and potentially limiting outside exposure to harsh wind and sun). \n\nSince everything starts with your cleanser, this means picking a creamier cleanser or one with lower amounts of surfactants. I've done a whole post on cleansers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), if you'd like to read about all the various types of cleansers and how they work. The long and short of it is look for either a wipe-off cleansers, such as Albolene; an oil cleanser that emulsifies (rinses clean) in water, such as my beloved Clinique Take the Day off Balm; a creamy cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Aquanil; or a gentle sudsing cleanser, such as Paula's Choice Hydralight or CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. Avoid washing with hot water, which reduces the size of the micelles (the molecules created from surfactants, which cluster together), allowing them to penetrate deeper into the skin and strip it further. You'll also want to completely avoid bar soaps (pH is too high), micellar water (can be much more irritating), makeup wipes (same as micellar water), and harsh cleansers that make your skin feel tight after cleansing. \n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate. \n\nMoisturizers are also a cornerstone in treating dehydrated skin. Humectants are especially important. Some humectants to look for:\n\n*   **Glycerin** - A well-established humectant, it is a clear, thick liquid that is usually sticky on it's own. It is derived from combining water and fat, usually vegetable oil. It is not typically irritating, but it can be to some people in high concentrations.\n*   **Hyaluronic Acid (HA)** - A component of glycosaminoglycan, it occurs naturally in the dermis of the skin and is thought to play a very important role in skin function. It is advertised frequently as holding up to \"1000\" times it's weight in water (citation needed). When applied, \"hyaluronic acid forms a viscoelastic film in a manner similar to the way it holds water in the intercellular matrix of dermal connective tissue.\"¹ It needs application regularly to be effective, frequently breaking down in skin 24-48 hours after application (note: this is not the case with HA injections). It is best applied to damp skin, straight out of the shower.\n*   **Urea** - While it is frequently considered more of a moisturizer or keratolytic (able to break down bonds on dead skin) ingredient, urea has humectant properties and can attract and hold moisture in the SC.\n\n* * *\n\nHealing Dehydrated Skin\n=======================\n\nArmed with the proper ingredients, skin can typically bounce back within about two weeks (14 days). Once healed, skin should be maintained with ingredients and products that are beneficial to the skin's health. \n\nWhile healing dehydrated skin, it is recommended to use the most bland routine possible and avoid trying new things and any active ingredients at all. _It should go without saying that to heal dehydrated skin, you must drop the products that are creating the problem in the first place._ If you must change out one or two products that you believe were causing your dehydration, do so slowly and one at a time, starting with any cleansers and then moving on to moisturizers. \n\nPetrolatum is helpful to some people as well, but can cause problems for others. This is possibly due to it's ability to diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin in some people, which interferes with recovery. Your mileage may vary. \n\nIt is also recommended to sleep with a humidifier if you are in a particularly dry climate. You want to shoot for somewhere between 40-60% indoor humidity, as this will prevent the humectants from drawing moisture from the deeper layers of the skin, which evaporates away.\n\n* * *\n\nSources\n=======\n\n1.

It was a crucial part of my routine while dehydrated and I still use it to this day. I live in a very humid environment and have genetically oily skin, so I was struggling to find products for the daytime that hydrated enough but were also lightweight enough to not make my skin any more oily. Aloe was a life-saver - it was the extra hydrating layer that my skin was craving. It's not enough on it's own but when used in conjunction with a hyaluronic acid product and the proper moisturizer, it can do wonders. I just wanted to bring this up for any oily skin types (and others) that are struggling to find the right products.",

I know I should probably add a gentle cleanser and moisturizer, but I am really scared to start anything new and am kind of hoping my skin can heal itself. Would it be okay to just use something really bland like vaseline? Is it okay to not use a cleanser and a moisturizer? I am scared to add too many things. Do you have any advice?

        "body": "Personligt hader jeg apps som kemiluppen af personlig holdning, for mig er det fearmongering  og får mig til at tænke på interesseorganisationen EWG 😅\n\nJeg går med solcreme dagligt i fjæset, det er SPF 50+ og 1/4 tsk af det. På denne tid af året bliver jeg nemt solskoldet, resten af året er det for min huds skyld + jeg bruger hudpleje der gør huden endnu mere sensitiv overfor solen (glykolsyre). \n\nDet mest vigtige for mig er at det er behageligt at bruge, hvis det ikke er det så får jeg det ikke taget på... I den forbindelse er jeg glad for Niveas ansigts solcremer bl.a. deres spf 50 face til sensitive hud (dog er den dårlig under makeup) og dem fra Garnier til ansigtet, de har bl.a. en tyndtflydende solcrememælk der tørrer mat på huden. \n\nJeg har prøvet Matas egen solcreme, men jeg kan slet ikke deres konsistenser! \n\nTil kroppen er enten et apoteksmærke, som f.eks. La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Avene osv. gode og ellers så laver Garnier og Nivea hæderlige solcremer til gode priser. \n\nI forhold til din liste af ingredienser du valgte også at ekskludere, synes jeg især det er interessant at sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, denatured alcohol og propylene glycol er inkluderet. De er alle fire totalt almindelige ingredienser i hudpleje (Dog er sodium lauryl sulfate og sodium laureth sulfate mest almindelige i sæber og renseprodukter) og jeg forstår ikke hvorfor du har skåret dem væk? Denatureret sprit fordamper efter applikation (og kan hjælpe med at solcremen tørrer ind) og ja det kan være udtørrende i nogle formularer, men ved hudpleje er det altid vigtigt at tage højde for formularen og ikke de individuelle ingredienser kun. Du kender jo selv at du kan bruge vand, mel, sukker og æg til at lave en del forskellige opskrifter, hvis du varierer metode og forhold... \n\nPropylene glycol i solcreme kan hjælpe solcremen med at sprede sig bedre på huden og hjælper med at opløse andre ingredienser i solcremen, da det er er godt solvent til mere hydrofobe stoffer. Det eneste jeg ved til kan være problematisk ved propylene alcohol er at det kan være irriterende for huden i høje koncentrationer (50% eller mere), men du vil sjældent se det brugt så koncentreret :p\n\nMichelle Wong, som er kosmetisk kemiker og har en PhD i kemi har skrevet på hendes blog om både [propylene glycol](https://labmuffin.com/what-are-propylene-and-butylene-glycol-and-are-they-safe/) og [SLS](https://labmuffin.com/whats-wrong-with-sls/).",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster.

In that, I recommended things to ask yourself and consider before buying new products or changing your routine entirely.\n\nI recently began blogging, but I wanted to bring these posts to Reddit as well for people who did not want to click out of the sub. \n\nLots of this is content that has been referenced over the years on this subreddit, as well as elsewhere. However, I understand the frustration for new users stumbling in, seeing product recommendations and terminology being thrown around, as well as an enormous sidebar. It's pretty anxiety-inducing. I also see a lot of people skipping from products to products, asking what to try next. \n\nMy goals with this series is to break down *what* goes into your cleansers and how it affects your skin so you are empowered to make better choices as well as understand some of the science that gets passed around.\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down your average, general cleansers as well as oil cleansers (or the oil-cleansing method aka OCM) and micellar cleansers. Let's dive right in!\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Cleansers**\n\nCleansers work by dissolving or binding to things on the skin that aren't normally rinsed away by water, such as the waxes or oils produced by our skin.\n\nWithout getting too into the weeds, they are able to do this with surfactants  (or \"the thing that makes cleansers sudsy\"). The most common surfactants, and the ones you may have heard of are SLS and SLES (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). These ingredients work by binding to the lipids (oils such as jojoba oil or silicones like dimethicone) and then being whisked away by their water-loving properties. Once mixed with water, surfactant molecules cluster together into little spheres known as micelles. Some surfactants molecular size allows them to penetrate deeper into the skin (namely SLS), where they can bind to skin cells. As you can imagine, this is very irritating to skin, and is what causes the eventual drying that you may experience after using some products.\n\nSo by increasing the size of these molecules or adding additional ingredients, we get a gentler cleanser.\n\nIf you've hung out in any beauty circle, you've probably also heard chatter of pH - \"What is the pH of that cleanser? Have you tried the CosRx Low pH Cleanser?\". The pH value of a cleanser can have an impact on how harsh your cleanser is on your skin as well, and simply put, it's because the surface of your skin is naturally pretty acidic.\n\nGoing back to Chemistry class really quickly, you'll probably remember something called the \"pH Scale.\"\n\nThings on the left side of the scale (1-6) are considered acidic. Things on the right side (8-14) are considered basic or alkaline. And of course, there is what is considered neutral, or pH 7. Skin has a pH of around 5.5, but becomes more basic the further down into the dermis you go, reaching a pH of about 7. Why is this important, you may be asking? Well, if you think back to your high school Chemistry course, you may have remembered the good ol' baking soda and vinegar reaction. When this reaction -- called an acid-base reaction -- occurs, the baking soda and vinegar exchange atoms and form different compounds, namely water and carbon dioxide. This is because bases are compounds that generally want to donate atoms and acids are compounds that generally want to accept atoms.\n\nAs skin comes in contact with other ingredients, even water, the pH temporarily raises and other compounds are created. Fatty acids (read: acidic components) of the skin are removed.\n\nHealthy skin can usually re-balance itself within an hour or so. Some skin takes longer to do this, especially skin that is prone to irritation, such as skin with acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. This is why your boyfriend can cleanse his face with a Dial soap bar and have glowing skin an hour later, while you're busily slathering on layer after layer of moisturizer.\n\nUsing a cleanser that is closer to our skin's natural pH is the obvious solution to this problem, and most modern cleansers are formulated much better than those of the past.\n\nSo now you're probably asking yourself: *Well, how can I test the pH of the cleanser I would like to buy? And how do I know the surfactant isn't going to irritate my skin?*\n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate.\n\nYou should also look for moisturizers, like oils, ceramides, cholesterol, and humectants (water-binding ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or squalane). Avoid saponified oils (please don't use Dr. Bronner's on your skin) and bar soap.\n\nNow I know you're asking: What about oil cleansers then?\n\n---\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\nWhat if I told you that your grandmother was ahead of the game?\n\nNearly all of us have seen a tub of Pond's Cold Cream hanging out in our grandmother's bathroom or on her vanity. You might've seen her dab some all over her skin and wipe away all of her makeup with a tissue. She may have sworn by it as the thing that kept her looking young, and she's not entirely wrong.\n\nI like to think of oil cleansers as being broken down into two types of cleansers -- wipe-off cleansers like your grandmother's Pond's, and emulsifying cleansers like the translucent oil cleansers that come in a pump or tub.\n\nThe former -- wipe-off cleansers -- are the most common mixtures in the cosmetics industry. They are usually simple mixtures of oil and water, and are high in water content, which makes them inexpensive.\n\nThey spread easily and often leave an oily or richly moisturized feeling behind. They're typically purchased by people with mature skin, but are a great alternative for people with dry skin.\n\nThe latter -- emulsifying cleansers -- are also mixtures of oil and water, but are higher in oil content, which makes them more expensive. They contain emulsifiers that bind well to water, which allows them to rinse away in water.\n\nThe benefit of these cleansers is there is no real \"sudsing\" action on the skin. Indeed many of them can actually feel \"moisturizing\" due to their ingredient makeup. They are also excellent for breaking down make-up and other waterproof things, such as mascara, due to the high oil content.\n\nWhen picking out an oil-cleanser, look for shortened ingredient lists. Don't be swayed by extracts or other frills that will wash away. The oil itself will be the biggest point of irritation (or not) for your skin, so don't be afraid of \"boring\" oils like mineral oil or petrolatum, which is one of the blandest, most non-reactive molecules around.\n\nJust one more to go...\n\n---\n\n**Micellar Cleansers**\n\nMicellar water is quite literally made up of micelles, or the molecular bunches of surfactants that group up, their water-loving butts faced outwards. These larger bunches of molecules, diluted in combinations of water and hydrating ingredients (such as glycerin), are the most mild of cleansers.\n\nThe percentage of surfactant to other ingredients is generally so low that micellar water does not need to be washed away. This allows the hydrating ingredients, such as glycerin, to stay on the skin after the debris has been removed.\n\nThis makes micellar water ideal for sensitive skin or prepping the skin for product application, when cleansing with a standard cleanser and water will be too drying.\n\n---\n\n**All Wrapped Up**\n\nSo what does this all mean? Here are some general skin cleanser guidelines to follow:\n\n* **Cleanse your skin at least once a day.** At the end of the day, your skin not only has a build-up of oils, but also debris and particulates in the air.\n* **Don't pile it on.** Your non-sudsing cleanser does not need to suds to work.\n* **Two-step cleanse for removing make-up.** Most make-up is waterproof and does not easily cleanse away. Use an oil cleanser to break down the make-up and remove it.\n* **Use cottons to remove cream cleansers like Pond's.** The friction will help to remove grime and dirt. Splash with water after to remove any leftover emulsifiers.\n* **Use cool water when cleansing.** Hot water can make surfactants penetrate deeper by reducing the size of the micelles, which is why your hot shower is more irritating and drying to your skin than the less-fun cooler shower.\n* **Moisturize.** Even water strips away the valuable fatty acids in your skin. Using a moisturizer on your skin after will help your skin to re-balance itself quicker.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Kind of Stephen](https://kindofstephen.com/)\n* [DermaScope](https://www.dermascope.com/ingredients/surfactants-and-emulsifiers)\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n",

SLS is the foaming agent in a lot of things but in the last ten years it’s become more common to find sulfate free. In my experience, the lower the cost of the product line, the less likely their sulfate free versions work for me- often they still result in a reaction which makes me think sulfate free labeling isn’t always true. Alba, Avalon organics, Yay for Earth and Loma are my favorite lines of beauty products that don’t break the bank. \n\nI’m so glad you’ve discovered this allergy and hope that you find products that work for you!",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

I'll be posting other pieces that I think will be useful too and linking them here so there's a comprehensive but approachable body of information to help people out.\n\nIf you have comments or suggestions, I'm very happy to receive them either here or in private message! \n\n# No-Poo Quick Start Guide\n\n## Clarifying wash\n\nAn extremely large number of hair and body products have silicones in them including but not limited to: shampoo, conditioner, commercial ‘oil’ blends, serums, curl creams, gel, mousse, pomade, dry shampoo, etc. The silicones coat your hair, completely sealing the hair strand, are not water soluble, and therefore are utterly incompatible with no-poo, low-poo, and true soap (saponified oils). They must be removed before starting, and can only be removed reliably by sulfates, specifically sodium lauryl sulfate or (SLS) or sodium laureth sulfate(SLES). If any of the products you have been using have silicone in them, or you have been using ingredients that can build up on your hair, the first step must be a clarifying wash.\n\nYou will need a cleanser that contains SLS/SLES but does not contain silicones or plastics. The two most popular are the ultra inexpensive Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo or any VO5 Shampoo that is not a 2 or 3 in 1. They are both around $1-2 at any common store in the USA. If you do not live in the USA and don’t have access to these products, you can check your local products using the tool at [www.isitcg.com](http://www.isitcg.com/) to see if they are suitable. The tool needs to find SLS/SLES, but if it finds any silicones the product is not suitable.\n\nWash well, massaging it into your scalp and along your hair to be sure to completely remove all silicone and product buildup, then rinse very well. You only have to do this once, as the assumed intention is to never use silicone or water insoluble ingredients again. If you do unintentionally get silicone on your hair, you will have to repeat this wash.\n\n## Mechanical Cleaning: Scalp Massage, Preening and Brushing/Combing\n\nBy choosing no-poo, you have decided to exchange low effort chemical stripping for the work of mechanical cleaning. This needs to be performed regularly and properly to be effective. During transition, you’ll most likely need to perform it daily and the tools you used like brush or comb need to be cleaned. They are a vital part of mechanical cleaning and need to be clean so they can help you clean your hair again tomorrow, instead of just spreading old oils and debris back through your hair. \n\n**If you are not getting the results you expect, then step up your mechanical cleaning.** During transition this won't necessarily make you look better, but it will help keep your scalp and hair healthy.\n\nTools made from natural materials like boar bristles, sisal, wood or even metal will be far more effective at moving your oils than synthetic materials like plastic or nylon, but if all you have is synthetic, it's far better than not using them at all. \n\nAs transition eases and passes, the work required becomes less, but never disappears. \n\n### Detangling Your Hair\n\nHair is delicate, and grows slowly, so you want to be gentle with it and cause the least amount of damage while taking care of it. Use a wide toothed comb for this, not a boar bristle brush as they are too soft to detangle efficiently. Start at the tips of your hair and gently detangle the first few inches. Move up a few inches and detangle that, continuing until you reach the roots. Use your fingers on stubborn tangles rather than yanking through them and breaking the hair. Realize that the parts you detangled earlier could get tangled again as you draw new tangles down or the strands get wrapped around fuzz or other debris in your hair. Slow, gentle strokes will prevent pulling or breakage. If you have dense hair, work in sections if possible. \n\n### How to Perform Mechanical Cleaning\n\nMechanical cleaning is the mainstay of no-poo so you need to learn to perform it properly. During transition it usually needs to be performed **daily** and **obsessively** or you will not have the results you need. Spending quality time each day gently massaging your scalp, preening and brushing will keep your scalp healthy and your hair smelling nice, even if it doesn’t look nice during transition. It can be difficult to take time out for personal grooming these days, but it can be very soothing once you learn to slow down. It also doesn’t need to be performed in a vacuum. Put on some music, listen to or read a book, browse the net, watch some tv, or even hang out with another person.\n\nThis guide from Just Primal Things does an outstanding job of explaining the whats and hows of performing mechanical cleaning. \n\n[https://justprimalthings.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/](https://justprimalthings.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/)\n\nA small addition is needed to explain how to preen either short hair or curly hair, as both require slightly different techniques. \n\n#### Preening Short Hair\n\nFor extremely short hair, like a buzz cut, you might not need to preen at all. Gently massaging your scalp with the pads of your fingers might be sufficient. If you find you need to preen, it is performed with the palm of the hand. Gently but firmly rub your palm along your scalp, following the general grain of the hair. You should not be pressing very hard, or irritating the scalp with quick, random, painful movements. Smooth, firm motions to spread and lift the oils are best.\n\nFor hair that is a little longer, make the motion like you are running your fingers through your hair, but instead of finishing the motion, close your fingers firmly so strands are caught between them and gently pull your hand away from your scalp. Continue until all your hair has been nicely preened.\n\n#### Preening Curly Hair When Dry\n\nHere is a short video that includes an explanation of the process. It involves separating out a curl clump and drawing it around and through the fingers while using the thumb and first finger to do the main preening. Wet preening can often be done like the guide shows, drawing the fingers straight down the section of hair, usually with water running through your hair. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gm9v6k/preening\\_curly\\_hair/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gm9v6k/preening_curly_hair/)\n\nIf you have coily or kinky hair, you can still do water washing, but you might need to modify your routine even further. There are quite a few videos on YouTube about how to work with this kind of hair too!\n\n### Cleaning your tools\n\nCleaning is easy, but needs to be done shortly after you've used the tool, so it has time to dry before you use it again. Sometimes they can even just be dry cleaned with another brush or comb. Cleanser can be anything that cleans. Dish soap, shampoo, clay, baking soda, etc. Just make sure your cleanser doesn't have silicone in it either! \n\nFor a bristle brush, pull all the shed hairs out of the brush, and then get it wet and spread some cleanser across the bristles. Ground the tips of the bristles in the palm of your hand and gently move the brush in a circular motion so all the surfaces of the bristles get cleaned. Use a fine toothed comb between each row of bristles, combing up through the bristles on either side to remove lint and fuzz. Rinse really well so all of the cleanser is removed from between the bristle clumps and let the brush dry in a ventilated area with the bristles pointing down so water doesn't collect in the bristle plugs. \n\nFor combs or pin brushes, spread some cleanser on the item and then use a soft scrub brush to clean between the tines or pins of the item, making sure you scrub at multiple angles to get everything clean. Rinse well and place the brush in a ventilated area with the bristles pointing down so that it can drain and dry properly. \n\nYou can clean wooden or horn items the same way you clean plastic. The brief exposure to water won't damage them, but don't let them soak. \n\nLet everything dry in a ventilated area. Don't put them in a cupboard or drawer or bag when wet as that will slow the drying and encourage the growth of mold. \n\n## Customize Your Routine\n\nSpend a few weeks settling into your new water only routine and practicing your mechanical cleaning techniques. Massage and preen, both dry and wet, **with cool or warm water running through the section of hair you are preening under the shower**, which is very effective at cleaning out excess oils and debris like lint and dust**.** If you are massaging your scalp when wet, do that under the water also, but **be very sure that you are being gentle** so you don’t damage it or unnecessarily loosen hair, causing it to come out before it’s ready to shed. When your hair is dry, detangle and then brush properly **in sections at multiple angles**. Keep the oils moving so they coat your hair, doing their job of conditioning, sealing and protecting it and so they don’t start to smell. If you've ever heard the old saying about brushing 100 strokes a day for healthy hair, this is why. \n\nAfter a while, you might run into some problems. Solve them as they actually happen, rather than anticipating and applying a solution you might not need. This will keep things simple, and allow you to slowly build your customized no-poo routine, developed specifically for your individual environment, biology, needs, presentability and preferences.\n\n## Simple Tests, Valuable Information\n\nYou need to learn some valuable information about your biology and environment that will help you choose proper methods and ingredients to care for your hair and avoid damage.\n\nThere is more information on all of these later in the guide. \n\n### Porosity\n\nYou need to learn the porosity of your hair because it affects how your hair reacts to almost everything in no-poo. The two most popular tests that you can find on the internet, the float and strand tests, are both notoriously inaccurate. Here is an easy quiz to help you figure it out. \n\nhttps://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/\n\n### Protein\n\nYou need to learn how to test for protein so you can know if your hair needs protein to be strong and supple, or if protein needs to be avoided so it doesn’t become dry and brittle. \n\nWhen you are in the shower and your hair is wet, take a shed strand and stretch it. Hair with the proper amount of protein should stretch about 20% before it stops, and should return to its original length when released. If it stretches more, it needs protein. If less, you want to avoid it.\n\n### Hard Water\n\nYou need to learn whether you have hard water, because it makes almost everything no-poo more difficult, and knowing what you have to work with will help with expectations. If there is mineral build up around your sinks, faucets, kettle or coffee pot, you have hard water. You can look up a hard water map of your area for a general idea of whether your dwelling has it. Your water provider’s web site should have it posted, if not you can call and ask.. If you want to spend a little money, there are at home test strips that you can buy.\n\nContinue to the next part: Transition: a Small Step to a New Lifestyle [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hu7q2r/transition\\_a\\_small\\_step\\_to\\_a\\_new\\_lifestyle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hu7q2r/transition_a_small_step_to_a_new_lifestyle/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(old) ~~What is Transition?~~ [~~https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hk5zr3/what\\_is\\_transition/~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hk5zr3/what_is_transition/)",

Does this mean I am still coating my hair with some sort of silicone? It also does contain Methosulfate, which I know sulfates are used to strip the silicones. Do I still need to do a true clarifying wash before starting the \"no poo\" method??\n\nThanks for your additional help!",

At first I couldn’t figure out if was the toothpaste, because it was at its worst after sleeping (and brushing before bed). Had allergy testing done and that came up with nothing. When I pieced it together that it was the toothpaste, I couldn’t figure out what ingredient caused it. I let my GP know but they didn’t seem interested at all and didn’t make any effort to investigate… not sure if I maybe should’ve followed up on this. I will check if that toothpaste has this ingredient, since I kept the leftover.\n\nEdit: just checked my current toothpaste and this contains SLS, but gives me no issues.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin.

But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

Is that what you want? To smell like momma’s little man? No. But now, you can upgrade your shower game with Doctor Squatch Natural Soap. I'm talking about natural nourishing, cold pressed, hand cut soap for men. Men who use their hands. Men who build things. Men who open the pickle jar in the first try. Men who catch foul balls without spilling their beer. You won't just smell good either. Your skin will be healthier and more nourished. Dare I say soft. Oh, men aren't supposed to have soft skin? Yeah, well men weren't supposed to cry during movies, and then they made the movie Rudy. You want to smell like the forest? Boom. Pine tar. We've got you. You want to smell like the sea? Boom. Nautical Sage, we've got you. You want to smell like you just got off a boat in the Caribbean? Boom. Bay Rum, we've got you. And with six more scents, we've got you covered no matter what kind of man you are. Now you're wondering why have I been doing it wrong for so long. During the First World War, big soaps started taking out all the natural ingredients to make production cheaper, and faster they replaced all the natural stuff with chemicals. Chemicals like sodium lauryl sulfate, parabens, and dioxin. Chemicals linked to depression, liver damage, cancer, and low sperm count. And, worst of all, dry skin. Oh, your poor balls. All dry, empty, and sad. But there's good news: we make our soaps with natural ingredients from the earth. Ingredients like oils, plants, goat's milk, Greek yogurt, oatmeal, shea butter, and citrus. No. Turn your shower game up to eleven with the smooth lather of Gold Moss or the exfoliating woodsy bliss that is Pine Tar. Get ready to step out of the shower feeling alive. Still not sure? Here's a couple reviews from real customers:\n\nJoseph S says,\n\n\"This is the perfect bar of soap. It's like you as handcrafted in the Northwest forest by beautiful, tiny, elves.\"\n\nOh, \"tiny elves\" isn't enough for you? Well, here's another review from Michael A:\n\n\"It makes you feel like you just stepped out of a mountain stream and Squatch was there to hand you the towel.\"\n\nTime for you to get the right tool for the job, 'cuz you're worth it, my friend. We ship it right to your door and with a hundred percent satisfaction guarantee, if it's not the best bar soap you've ever used it's on us. Tens of thousands of men already soapscribe, which means that every month fresh new bars a Squatch show up at their door. Click the link for Doctor Squatch Natural Soap. Real soap for real men. Or, don't, and continue to be mommy's little helper. \n\nThat's a wrap! Wooo!\n\nAlright! Nice! Nice! Did he click it yet? Did he click the link? He hasn't clicked the link? I would've wanted to have heard about that dry sad balls, mmm. Man, what's this guy doing? Click the link man, step up your shower game.",

    "body": "Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.\n\nSo I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467087\n\n#What is hair?\n\n>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*\n\n>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*\n\n[Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1083/7638/files/Hair-Anatomy-e1421050694589.png?v=1505924657)\n\n\n#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?\n\nOver time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.\n\nPrior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.\n\nIn recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.\n\nMost proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.\n\n#How does shampoo work?\n\nThe main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is \"create suds\" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.\n\n>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* \n\nWhat this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.\n\nSurfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.\n\n[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) \n\n* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.\n 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate\n 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate\n 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate\n 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.\n\n* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.\n\n* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.\n\n* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.\n\nAll shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word \"sulfate\", though)\n\nHigh end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.\n\n#####How often should I shampoo?\n\nYou probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n#The benefit of conditioner\n\nModern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.\n\nThe solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. \n\nA conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. \n\n>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*\n\nConditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:\n\n* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner\nPolymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)\n\n* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)\n\n* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]\n\n* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.\n\nThe big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.\n\nLike all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.\n\n*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.\n\n#How to wash and condition your hair.\n\nThe way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.\n\nShampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. \n\nOnce the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.\n\nLeaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.\n\nAfterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. \n\n(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)\n\n#TL;DR?\n\n* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. \n\n* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\n* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. \n\n* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.\n\n* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.\n\n* The key to good hair care is not going \"no poo\" or \"sulfate/silicon free\", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I believe your statement to be true that sulfates themselves wont stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. However, washing your hair too often will substantially raise the rate at which your scalp produces oil and thus the rate at which your hair gets greasy. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that when you wash your hair and scalp, you'll also inevitably stimulate the skin in that area, creating friction which results in more blood flow that will make the sebaceous glands \"work better\". The second reason is that by washing your hair you'll also remove the oil from your scalp. Leaving your skin in a dry condition. Dry skin will make your sebaceous glands work overtime to fix exactly that problem, as their main function is to lubricate and waterproof your skin. \n\nTldr: Don't wash your hair too often, it will get your hair greasy fast. It can also cause dandruff in the long term by overstimulating the sebaceous glands.\n\nSource: Studied hairdressing and am a barber.",

    "body": "# Proof That Sugar/Cavities Are Killing You\n\nI'm going to prove it here:\n\n[How to Stop Tooth Decay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_-X6CBQtw)\n\nThe above video shows that *processed* sugar is the ONLY cause behind cavities.\n\n[Best Food for Periodontal Disease and Cavities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLat2Im_R84&t=40s)\n\nThe above shows that people before tooth brushes (and processed sugar) had no cavities. They even replicated the results with people on a survivor like reality show. While plaque on their teeth went up, the bacteria that causes cavities and gingivitis disappeared. Their gum health also improved.\n\n(They also ate sugary foods like berries and honey. [Honey](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2001/02/28/Honey-fights-tooth-decay), despite having a ton of sugar, has been shown to have antibacterial properties and is probably fine for your teeth.)\n\n[The Hidden Epidemic - Interview with Dr. Thomas Levy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7s8susk4a4) (LONG video but WORTH the watch)\n\nThis video shows that all the abscesses from rotten teeth and gum disease are the cause behind most oxidative stress in your body, heart attacks, and even cancers.\n\nAlmost all heart attacks (the number ONE killer in America) had plaque and bacteria in it that causes cavities.\n\nThe pressure from the jaw while eating pushes all that bacteria in your lymph nodes and blood stream.\n\n\n# What About Acidic Foods?\n\nWhile, yes, people who eat a lot of acidic and sweet foods (like vegans) tend to get more cavities, it isn't the *main* contributor.\n\nHere is the thing: your body is built to handle acidic foods but not PURE SUGAR.\n\nYes, acidic foods will wear down the enamel of your teeth but those foods are only on your teeth for a little while—and your teeth are supposed to remineralize and heal any damage done overnight while you sleep.\n\n(Personally, I have a ton of cavities between my teeth because I hate orange and apples all the time and the pulp would get stuck between my teeth all day. Would I never get cavities there if I didn't eat processed sugar back then? I don't know. But I don't think it'll hurt to floss after you eat certain acidic foods like oranges and apple. If you can't floss, keep toothpicks handy. Even a rinse with water wouldn't hurt.)\n\nAlso, [wait about at least an hour after eating acidic foods before brushing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8BKmlTLwUo). They're in a weakened state, and you'll scrub off more enamel material.\n\n# Fix Your Teeth - Videos To Watch\n\nSo you want to start preventing cavities but not sure if you can COMPLETELY remove all that sugar?\n\nHere are some other good videos worth watching. I'll give TL;DRs for you as well:\n\n[NO CAVITIES after YEARS without dentist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trvMgLQEnYw)\n\nA paleo woman (so almost no processed sugar in her diet) goes to the dentist after 3 years to find no cavities (claims to also not have a cavity for 9 years). How did she do it? 3 things:\n\n* **Natural toothpaste** (Dr. Bronner's Peppermint All-One Toothpaste) without fluoride (as she claims it kills the good bacteria in your mouth)\n* **Cod Liver oil high in vitamin D** (Green Pasture's Fermented Cod Liver Oil and Concentrated Butter Oil) - claims what has kept her from getting a cavity in 9 years\n* **Fermented food like sauerkraut** (fermented versions with good bacteria will always be in the refrigerated section of the grocery store). Instructs you to make sure it doesn't contain vinegar.\n\n[Natural Cure For Gum Disease Amazing Results!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eJX4Ga6kZ0)\n\nWoman shows that putting **fermented vegetable juice** (like the juice from sauerkraut) in her gums healed her gum disease.\n\n[Heal Gums Naturally with Probiotics (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9T4lmWins)([Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrN8PB-aZJI))\n\nElderly lady uses standard gut probiotics to heal her gums and teeth—**she put gut probiotics directly on her gums**. She open the capsules and packed them directly between the teeth and gums with her tongue. Said she **did it for 4 days** and stopped after her body told her to.\n\nI wish she would give the brand, but this is all I could find in the comments when one person asked:\n\n>You want ones with a variety of cultures in them with both \"bifido...\" strains and \"Lacto...\" strains. No particular brand.\n\nFirst video also said her brand had about **10 billion per capsule with mostly various Lactobacillus strains**.\n\n[What’s the Best Mouthwash?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyghcN9Sws)\n\nAbove video shows that **green tea plus amla powder** is way more effective and safer than the most popular commercial mouthwashes.\n\n[Waterpik Flosser + Real Salt = Oral Health Game Changer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWawWdsJUu8)\n\n**Water flossing with salt water**\n\n[3 Home Tips to Keep Your Mouth Healthy ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUq42lkvxRo)\n\n**Water flossing with hydrogen peroxide**\n\n[Is CAPB in SLS-Free Toothpaste Any Better?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAlYq4hDglA&t=274s)\n\n**Avoid all detergent toothpastes**, especially sodium lauryl sulfate.\n\n[The Best Toothpaste!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_GpHjng7OE)\n\n**The best toothpaste is no toothpaste?**\n\n[Xylitol Pulling Instead of “Oil Pulling” For Even Better Results!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t58ucaPcGE)\n\n**Xylitol mouthwash**\n\n[Make Your Own Mouthwash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDT2Y8N7Z9w)\n\n**DIY mouthwash** (water, baking soda, and mint essential oil)\n\n[What Happened After 4 Years Using DIY Toothpaste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh4NXZFgtIg)\n\n**DIY toothpaste** (calcium carbonate powder, coconut oil, baking soda, trace mineral powder, and peppermint essential oil)\n\nShe claims the popular one you see online (just coconut oil, baking soda, and peppermint oil) actually *de*mineralized her teeth, but she *re*mineralized her teeth with her new formula.\n\n[Killing Bacteria Naturally with Salt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQuOVRJkhlo)\n\nMicroscope vision of bacteria dying from salt water\n\n[Fluoride in Water - The Good, The Bad & The Ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RHVGIyhmEE)\n\nNot giving a TL;DR for this one as fluoride for your teeth is a complex issue.\n\n[Fluoride in Our Water | 2 Alarming New Studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nizvddHUd0)\n\n**A few studies that will make you think twice about fluoride.**\n\n[Raederle's Teeth Remineralizing Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF06YqKL_qw)\n\nHolistic approach to remineralizing your teeth. I usually make fun of hippy girls like this but everything she says agrees with the above. I guess she's just way smarter than me :)\n\n**Supplement or get naturally** (she covers how): K2, calcium (phosphorus), silica, magnesium, retinol, vitamin D2 or D3, DHA & EPA, vitamin C, iodine, selenium, and zinc.\n\n**Avoid**: triclosan, alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate, fluoride, and excess amounts of glycerin (they're in almost all toothpastes, even the \"natural\" ones). Personally, I would add [carrageenan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8zoPKID_eM) to that list. (Updat: she mentions to avoid that later in the video series. See, she knows what she's talking about!)\n\n**Add to your dental routine**: 20 minutes of oil pulling each day; water flossing after your brush; rinse with sea salt after oil pulling, flossing, or brush; and  mouthwash (herbal for gum infections or with fermented foods like coconut kefir of sauerkraut).\n\nThe only thing I'm not sure about is oil pulling based off the video on about [oil pulling risks (lipoid pneumonia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zf5PKnKIJc), how [oil pulling undermines the protective teeth layer against acid (at least temporarily)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=betOW0qVGLM&t=283s), but [oil pulling is as effective as commercial mouthwashes (however, so might swishing with water for 20 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72lfQUJo10k&t=260s) from Dr. Greger.\n\nSo if you're going to oil pull, do it before bed or wait a few hours before eating anything acidic. Also, don't swallow the oil, clear the back of your throat and tongue of any oil, and then brush your tooth using a different toothbrush rather than your regular one. And if you think you have any kind of leak into your nasal cavity, you shouldn't oil pull. See above for some great alternatives.\n\nFinally, go to your dentist! At the very least, they can see things in your mouth you can't. Yes, the [x-rays are bad for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYGkvMwqyys) (don't do them all the times and [get your antioxidant levels way up that day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAlUwBOk1kg&t=236s)), but you need to get checked from time to time. Better to tackle a cavity while it's small and where you can remineralize it, before it becomes a big problem where they want to do a root canal on you.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**Keep in mind, if you didn't grow up eating sugary sweets, you wouldn't crave them, they would be too sweet.**\n\n[Your taste buds adapt.](https://paleoleap.com/taste-buds-sugar/)\n\nBut all that the sugar industry cares about is selling more product.\n\n**Edit**: Added a *proven* DIY toothpaste (the lady claims the popular one you see online *de*mineralized her teeth, but she saved them with her formula), link to show that your taste buds will adapt, added the remineralizing master class by Raederle, Dr. Greger talking a ton about oil pulling, and a video on how another older woman healed her gums with off-the-shelf probiotics. Cleaned up the post with headers. Added more info on dentists and x-rays, and on acidic foods and brushing.\n\n**Bonus**: Watch [Root Cause (2018)](https://tubitv.com/movies/507721).

I use Redman Earthpaste because it only contains five ingredients: purified water, bentonite clay, non-GMO xylitol, essential oils, and sea salt.

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

The water is \"thinner\" and gets into things better.\n\nAnionic surfactants are found in those detergents which involve a large volume of rinse water.  Laundry, dishes, shampoo etc.  They are great at attracting dirt, lifting it in an emulsion, and carrying it away in a LOT of rinse water.\n\nThe downside is when there is incomplete rinsing.  Then, the residue actually creates a bigger problem. Your original surface is now a magnet for dirt, and you will re-soil faster and with greater severity.\n\nYou should now be recoiling in horror at anyone who puts Tide or Dawn in their bissell machine with its weak rinsing and suction.  It's now a positive feedback loop of increasingly dirty carpets. \"It smells GREAT!\"   🤦\n\nThat is why carpet \"shampoos\" have non-ionic surfactants, solvents, and other stuff which does not attract dirt afterwards.  Yes, even if you know you left a residue, it will not ACTIVELY attract dirt.  It is a neutral molecule.  You will not be worse than when you started.\n\nCationic surfactants are the fabric softeners in our lives.  It is meant to leave a residue, but one that actively repels dirt.\n\nYou should now be furrowing your brow in confusion at the prospect of a DIY carpet shampoo which mixes detergent with fabric softener.  Huh?\n\nIf one uses anionic surfactants on a carpet it MUST be rinsed and sucked to a degree which is way beyond the power of a home unit.  Even then it would be sparing, because there are reasons why we don't want our machines sucking up foamy stuff.\n\n**Edit**: Unless you went out of your way to get \"carpet shampoo\" or fabric softener, you will invariably dealing with **anionic** surfactant.  Sodium lauryl sulfate is a big one.  Hand soap, hair shampoo, dish detergent, natural soaps, etc.  If the spout retains a gummy sticky gel which never quite dries, that's a good sign of anionic.",

    "body": "For many of us, winter is upon us, which means dry, itchy, chapped skin. As a result, most of us have to change up our routines a bit to compensate for the lack of moisture in the cold air as well the amount of time we spend inside with our heaters blasting. \n\nThe most important things you need to remember when evaluating your winter routine are as follows:\n\n* How much **moisture** is in my routine?\n* What is my daily **environment** like?\n* What are my **habits** like?\n\n---\n\n**Moisture**\n\nThough moisture is part of the environmental issues behind winter skin, this portion will be primarily focused upon *what you are putting on your skin.* Creams, lotions, serums, powders, oils, and soaps are all part of our daily lives. However, there are general tips to follow when choosing these products as well as applying them.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, you want to try to **avoid irritating ingredients** as much as possible. Irritants include [bad alcohols](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2ebpCvtrMU&list=PL7QNgFLgKuaJNHEYFWWlt_9g9tF5KpG7C), fragrance, essential oils (such as lavender, peppermint, and eucalyptus), menthol, camphor, clove, and soaps (primarily sodium LAURYL sulfate). \n\nWhile purely anecdotal, I have noticed that when my skin is drier, it is also irritated much easier. This may be due to a compromised moisture barrier, [which is explained very well by Veronica Gorgeois](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_ihqNtYvmE). Some ingredients also simply irritate otherwise normal skin and dry it out, causing a vicious cycle of moisturization -> drier skin -> moisturization. Some of you may notice this when you use a \"tingly\" lip balm, such as Carmex, and find that your chapped lips actually begin to feel DRIER than they were when you purchased the product. \n\nHowever, if you are not using any of these ingredients and find that your skin is still drying out, consider adding rich, skin-loving ingredients such as argan oil, mineral oil, petrolatum (Vaseline), lanolin (body only), cholesterol, ceramides, aloe, and shea butter. Antioxidants such as vitamin C, niacinamide, and quercetin, are also fantastic for any skin type, year 'round, and prevent irritation. You should also look for products with humectants high on the ingredient list, the most common being glycerin followed by [hyaluronic acid](http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/hyaluronic-acid) and squalane. These products will hold moisture to the skin while occlusives such as mineral oil and petrolatum will *seal* it in. This is why we recommend using Vaseline in conjunction with your regular moisturizer. \n\nIf you have oily skin, you don't necessarily need to use a very rich moisturizer if experiencing dryness. Simply apply an occlusive to your driest spots or try a light lotion rather than your regular gel moisturizer (for example).\n\n**I also highly recommend using your moisturizer right after the shower or bath.** You don't even need to pat dry completely before application.\n\n---\n\n**Environment**\n\nPossibly the largest reason skin dries out during the winter is the drier winter air. To combat this, **get a humidifier**. A humidifier is a fairly inexpensive way to combat dry skin all year 'round, but especially during the winter. If you have a very large home, you may need two or three humidifiers to really gain the benefit. I recommend a *warm* mist humidifier, as it does not get as germy, nor does it make a room feel clammy like a cool mist humidifier can. \n\nAlso, be sure you are using sunscreen 365 days a year, no matter whether or not the sun is shining. If you're on the market for a good sunscreen, I highly recommend [Skinacea's write-ups on sunscreen](http://www.skinacea.com/sunscreen/sunscreen.html#.Uq6vWfRDt1g) before you buy. \n\n---\n\n**Habits**\n\nThis is very individual, but these are the things that have helped me the most:\n\n* **Avoid soaking in a bath without epsom salts or taking very long, hot showers**. In short, water strips necessary oils from the skin, especially hot water. This is much worse if you have hard water. Strangely enough though, I've found that rich, epsom salt baths help my skin more than hinder it. \n* **Exfoliate your skin more often, but do it gently**. I know we frequently harp on about chemical exfoliation here, but it is truly one of the best forms of exfoliation, especially for the face, since it avoids irritating the skin when used correctly. Exfoliating will facilitate a more normal skin-cell turnover rate, and thus, less dry skin. Look for AHAs such as glycolic and lactic acid.\n* **Drink your water**. As I've said before, there's no reason to go overboard and drink water until you sound like an ambulatory kiddy pool, but I personally notice an enormous difference when I am skipping out on my 64 oz of water a day. \n* **Take a fish oil supplement, if you tolerate them and they do not interfere with any medication you are on**. This can help people with dry eyes and dry lips. Your mileage may vary, but my mother and her optometrist swear by this for managing dry, winter eyes.\n* **Avoid over-washing your hands when possible**. Hand soaps are brutal on your hands, but more so when your skin is already dry. If you have particularly dry hands and/or cannot avoid washing your hands during the day, consider applying a thick lotion at night as well as an occlusive (Vaseline or Aquaphor are good choices) before slipping your hands into a pair of cotton gloves. You can do the same thing with your feet, save for the gloves.\n* **Speaking of Aquaphor, use it at night on your lips**. In the AM, gently buff away dead skin with a warm, damp washcloth. If petrolatum does not agree with you, [Lansinoh](http://www.amazon.com/Lansinoh-HPA-Lanolin-1-41-oz/dp/B0018DMYX4) is also fantastic. During the day, use a rich, plain lip butter or balm. I *really* love Nivea, such as [this one](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/Nivea-Lip-Butter-Loose-Tin-Vanilla-&-Macadamia-Kiss?skuId=910170) and [this one](http://www.iherb.com/Nivea-A-Kiss-of-Smoothness-Hydrating-Lip-Care-SPF-10-0-17-oz-4-8-g/45747?gclid=CKb2_cyltLsCFaxr7Aod-XAAqQ&gclsrc=aw.ds).\n* **Limit how much alcohol you consume**. This is really difficult during the holidays, but personally, alcohol really wreaks havoc on my skin after awhile. Again, this is individual, but definitely try to study how your habits affect your skin.\n* **Get more sleep**. I know, this is a pretty general skincare tip, but my winter skin needs all the love it can get, and I find that my skin is the first place I see problems when I neglect getting enough rest.\n* **Find a gentle, sulfate-free toothpaste.** This may seem like a weird one, but like soaps, toothpastes can dry out the delicate mouth and lips. I found that using a gentle toothpaste, like Biotene, has reduced not only my dry lips, but also the mouth sores I used to get.\n\n---\n\nHopefully this guide has been helpful to some of you out there. I know how bad dry skin can be (hello, eczema!), but you can manage it by evaluating your current routines and being as kind to your skin as possible. \n\nHave a lovely holiday, beautiful people! :)\n\n\n\n",

While I haven't found my ultimate HG, I've had some interesting experiences: some good, some not so good... These are all the cleansers I've used this year.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I try to be as honest as possible with my reviews. That said, my skin is *extremely* reactive and my ratings reflect that. YMMV! - I should also mention that although I'll be describing scents, all the products I've listed are fragrance free, with a maximum of one essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SKIN TYPE:** Combo leaning oily. \n\n* **Proclivities:** Sensitive with mild rosacea, often dehydrated, and breakout-prone.\n* **Sensitivities:** Shea Butter, Fragrance, Essential Oils, and often Niacinamide. \n* **Climate:** Southeastern Canada, “humid continental”. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CURRENT ROUTINE:**\n\n* DEAR, KLAIRS Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil (PM)\n* ISNTREE Green Tea Fresh Cleanser (AM/PM)\n* (non-AB) PAULA’S CHOICE 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (PM, twice weekly)\n* COSRX Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner (AM/PM)\n* COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (AM/PM)\n* ETUDE HOUSE SoonJung 10-Free Moist Emulsion (AM/PM)\n* ILLIYOON Ceramide ATO Concentrate Cream (PM, often)\n* (non-AB) EUCERIN Aquaphor Healing Ointment (PM, sometimes)\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Water Fit Sun Serum (AM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WATER-BASED CLEANSERS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CETAPHIL Gentle Skin Cleanser - OG** (non-AB)\n\n* **Price:** \\~$8 for 500ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate 😳\n* **Used For:** \\~10 years\n* **Scent:** Doctor’s Office\n* **Wash Sensation:** Uninspired\n* **Finish:** Untouched\n* **User Experience:** The hideous bottle, clinical scent, and uh… boyish texture make this an utterly joyless cleansing experience. But it’s as cheap as I am. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Gentle, non-drying, and doesn’t do a great job of cleansing, but TBH that’s often what I *want*. The best western cleanser I’ve tried, and my \"HG\" for many years, because sometimes you just need something that doesn't ruin your skin. **4/5**\n* **RATING: 6/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CETAPHIL Gentle Skin Cleanser - Reformulation** (non-AB)\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 500ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Niacinamide 😒\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Hospital\n* **Wash Sensation:** Disappointed\n* **Finish:** Irritated & Itchy\n* **User Experience:** Same as above, but it smells much worse and stings on contact. **1/5**\n* **Effects:** With the added “benefit” of the niacinamide, this felt similar to the original, but more drying. It also provides a long lasting itch and a slight flush! **1/5**\n* **RATING: 1/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ROUND LAB - Mugwort Calming Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$15 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Mugwort Extracts 🧐, Sage Oil 😒, Green Tea Extract 🥰, Allantoin 🥰, Madecassoside 🥰, Panthenol 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Irish-Spring-But-Herbal\n* **Wash Sensation:** Slightly Attacked\n* **Finish:** Very Dry\n* **User Experience:** I was curious to try for the mugwort scent, but found it bland and soapy. This does a great job of cleansing, and creates buckets of foam that get into every orifice on my face. Probably not the best choice for my first foaming cleanser after a decade+ of only using milky gels. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Holy drying, Batman! I tried to convince myself that I just needed to get used to foam, but no. Just no. **1/5**\n* **RATING: 3/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ROUND LAB - 1025 Dokdo Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Chamomile Oil 😒, Hyaluronic Acid 💦, Ceramide NP 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~1 month\n* **Scent:** Chamomile & Plastic\n* **Wash Sensation:** Fluffy\n* **Finish:** Slightly Dry / Slightly Filmy\n* **User Experience:** Smells neutral yet slightly plasticky with a hint of chamomile. I found this vastly more pleasant to use. Same as above: literal pea sized amount = foam for days, but it gets extra points for the less offensive scent. Also the little seal on the bottle fills me with joy and I'm simple that way. **3/5**\n* **Effects:** This is much gentler than and not as drying as the Mugwort, but it also leaves a moisturizing film that I don’t like. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 5/10 WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISNTREE - Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$18 for 220ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Yam Root Extract 🧐,  Oat Meal Extract 🙃\n* **Used For:** \\~a few days\n* **Scent:** Unsweetened Taro Bubble Tea\n* **Wash Sensation:** Creamy & Surprised\n* **Finish:** Liberally Buttered\n* **User Experience:** This has such a beautiful creamy scent. It would have been a gentle, soothing experience if my face didn’t just EAT IT UP. I tried using this on both wet and dry skin, but no matter what, my skin was hungry for yam. This alarmed me... Not what I want from a cleanser. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** I often have good luck with products for dry skin because I’m sensitive, but this was a good reminder that *I do, in fact, have oily skin*. Despite this cleanser instantly absorbing into my skin, it also left a thick moisturizing film that broke me out nearly instantaneously. **1/5**\n* **RATING: 3/10 WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BEAUTY OF JOSEON - Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$11 for 100ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Green Tea Extract 🥰, so many plant extracts 😒\n* **Used For:** \\~2 weeks\n* **Scent:** Heavenly Bittersweet Plum\n* **Wash Sensation:** Completely Delighted\n* **Finish:** Very Moisturized\n* **User Experience:** The best smelling cleanser I’ve ever used. This has a sweet and fruity scent with an intriguingly sour edge. It’s a fun, goopy gel that creates an extremely tight and luxurious foam. It feels so modern and innovative!. Plus the package is utterly beautiful. **5/5**\n* **Effects:** This is so gentle and leaves my skin feeling extremely moisturized, while doing a better job of cleansing than a western milky gel. But in less than a week it gave me hella whiteheads. I continued to use it for a further week because I was in denial. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 7/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ETUDE HOUSE - SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Madecassoside 🥰, Green Tea Extract 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~2 weeks\n* **Scent:** Grassy Almond Water\n* **Wash Sensation:** Soft & Velvety\n* **Finish:** Untouched\n* **User Experience:** The best foaming cleanser I’ve ever tried. This has the same soothing grassy almond milk scent as the rest of the SoonJung line with just a touch of plastic. One pump creates the perfect amount of silky foam. Small gripe: despite how gentle this is, it gives me a lil eye sting. **4/5**\n* **Effects:** Does an excellent job of cleansing without being stripping, breaking me out, or leaving a film, but I also don’t find it hydrating or moisturizing - it’s just neutral. If someone's looking for a replacement for their bland western cleanser, this would be my top recommendation. That said, it might be a touch too drying for a twice-daily cleanse.  **4/5**\n* **RATING: 8/10 - MRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISNTREE - Green Tea Fresh Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$17 for 120ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Green Tea Leaf Powder 🥰, Green Tea Leaves 😒, Green Tea Extract 🥰, Hyaluronic Acid 💦\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Hot Green Tea\n* **Wash Sensation:** Refreshed\n* **Finish:** Untouched & Hydrated\n* **User Experience:** The packaging doesn’t thrill me, but this is a lovely gel that creates a loose, barely-there foam. It smells delightful, and even though I can't use anything with fragrance, I love a good scent. This cleanser smells like a freshly-brewed hot cup of over-steeped green tea. It also has tiny leaves in it that mostly evaporate on contact, but I’ll occasionally get a bigger chunk and have to fish it out because I can’t deal with any amount of physical exfoliation. **4/5**\n* **Effects:** This is so gentle without being overbearingly moisturizing. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated even if I don’t apply additional hydration immediately afterwards. - This would absolutely be HG if not for the leaves, and I would highly recommend it to all but the driest of the dry skinned people. **5/5**\n* **RATING: 9/10 - WRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FIRST CLEANSERS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BIODERMA - Sensibio Micellar Cleansing Water** (non-AB)\n\n**Price:** \\~$15 for 250ml (IIRC)\n\n* **Notable Ingredients:** Cucumber Fruit Extract 🙃\n* **Used For:** \\~5 years\n* **Scent:** Clinical Water\n* **Wash Sensation:** Cautious & Afraid\n* **Finish:** Sad & Soapy\n* **User Experience:** Apparently, even the finest Shiseido cotton pads are too exfoliating for my skin. This does a fine job of removing makeup and sunscreen, but I really don’t find this that gentle (possibly because of the friction with the cotton pads). - I know I’m in the minority here, but rosacea-prone skin really do be like that. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Okay as a first cleanse, but if I use this on its own it breaks me out like crazy, even if I rinse it off. This makes me nervous to use it in general, and I'd rather just use an oil cleanser so I'm not wasting cotton pads. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 4/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DEAR KLAIRS - Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$22 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Sunflower Seed Oil 😐, Grape Seed Oil 😐, Jojoba Seed Oil 😐, Black Currant Seed Oil 😐\n* **Used For:** \\~8 months\n* **Scent:** Absolutely Neutral\n* **Wash Sensation:** Dubious\n* **Finish:** Slightly Tight\n* **User Experience:** I’ve technically been oil cleansing for \\~20 years because my childhood friend’s dad was a clown and taught me the way. That said, this is my first *actual* oil cleanser, and it's obviously miles ahead of well... food. - This smells like nothing, glides smoothly over my skin, and emulsifies instantly, but it could be gentler. **3/5**\n* **Effects:** The longer I use this, the less I like it. At first it worked wonderfully, but after many months it feels more drying with every use. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 5/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISO: a new oil cleanser!** Thinking of trying either the Muji Mild Cleansing Oil or Peach & Lily Ginger Melt, but LMK if you have any suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[MANY EDITS: Mostly formatting, extra details, etc.\\]",

I love the way you describe everything and now I really want to try grassy almond water 😂 Was also really proud to see the Isntree green tea cleanser ranked so highly, it's one of my favorites too! For cleansing oils, if you haven't tried it I'd tentatively recommend Purito's From Green Cleansing Oil - it's been a long time since I've used it (I get too excited and want to try every product out there), but when I used it my skin barrier was terribly damaged and it was still really gentle, never stung etc. If you want to try another foam cleanser, I'd recommend the Real Barrier cream cleansing foam - I got mine at a great discount (StyleKorean, $9.90 for 220ml) and it's a nice balance between cream and foam cleansers imo! We seem to have similar skin types so I think this would work well for you in the fall/winter, though it does contain some essential oils so I'd tread carefully!",

My skin is also sensitive to fragrance and a little dry so finding an oil cleanser that is fragrance free non drying and doesn’t have those ingredients feels so rare.

    "body": "This is now in the wiki section of the sub! \n\n[Quick Start Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/wiki/index/quickstart)\n\nThis is part of something larger I'm working on with the help of the community at large and several other users. I thought this section would be useful as is until my crazy life settles down and I can actually dedicate time and attention to finishing it. I've taken too long to work on this and reddit automatically archived my previous post so I can no longer edit it and people can't comment.  I'm reposting so we can all interact with it again.\n\n# No-Poo Quick Start Guide\n\n## Clarifying wash\n\nAn extremely large number of hair and body products have silicones in them including but not limited to: shampoo, conditioner, commercial ‘oil’ blends, serums, curl creams, gel, mousse, pomade, dry shampoo, etc. The silicones coat your hair, completely sealing the hair strand, are not water soluble, and therefore are utterly incompatible with no-poo, low-poo, and true soap (saponified oils). They must be removed before starting, and can only be removed reliably by sulfates, specifically sodium lauryl sulfate or (SLS) or sodium laureth sulfate(SLES). If any of the products you have been using have silicone in them, or you have been using ingredients that can build up on your hair, the first step must be a clarifying wash.\n\nYou will need a cleanser that contains SLS/SLES but does not contain silicones or plastics. The two most popular are the ultra inexpensive Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo or any VO5 Shampoo that is not a 2 or 3 in 1. They are both around $1-2 at any common store in the USA. If you do not live in the USA and don’t have access to these products, you can check your local products using the tool at [www.isitcg.com](http://www.isitcg.com) to see if they are suitable. The tool needs to find SLS/SLES, but if it finds any silicones the product is not suitable.\n\nWash well, massaging it into your scalp and along your hair to be sure to completely remove all silicone and product buildup, then rinse very well. You only have to do this once, as the assumed intention is to never use silicone or water insoluble ingredients again. If you do unintentionally get silicone on your hair, you will have to repeat this wash.\n\n## Mechanical Cleaning: Scalp Massage, Preening and Brushing/Combing\n\nBy choosing no-poo, you have decided to exchange low effort chemical stripping for the work of mechanical cleaning. This needs to be performed regularly and properly to be effective. During transition, you’ll most likely need to perform it daily and the tools you used like brush or comb need to be cleaned. They are a vital part of mechanical cleaning and need to be clean so they can help you clean your hair again tomorrow, instead of just spreading old oils and debris back through your hair.\n\n**If you are not getting the results you expect, then try increasing the time you spend on mechanical cleaning.** During transition this won't necessarily make you look better, but it will help keep your scalp and hair healthy.\n\nTools made from natural materials like boar bristles, sisal, wood or even metal will be far more effective at moving your oils than synthetic materials like plastic or nylon, but if all you have is synthetic, it's far better than not using them at all.\n\nAs transition eases and passes, the work required becomes less, but never disappears.\n\n## Detangling Your Hair\n\nHair is delicate, and grows slowly, so you want to be gentle with it and cause the least amount of damage while taking care of it. Use a wide toothed comb for this, not a boar bristle brush as they are too soft to detangle efficiently. Start at the tips of your hair and gently detangle the first few inches. Move up a few inches and detangle that, continuing until you reach the roots. Use your fingers on stubborn tangles rather than yanking through them and breaking the hair. Realize that the parts you detangled earlier could get tangled again as you draw new tangles down or the strands get wrapped around fuzz or other debris in your hair. Slow, gentle strokes will prevent pulling or breakage. If you have dense hair, work in sections if possible.\n\n## How to Perform Mechanical Cleaning\n\nMechanical cleaning is the mainstay of no-poo so you need to learn to perform it properly. During transition it usually needs to be performed **daily** and **obsessively** or you will not have the results you need. Spending quality time each day gently massaging your scalp, preening and brushing will keep your scalp healthy and your hair smelling nice, even if it doesn’t look nice during transition. It can be difficult to take time out for personal grooming these days, but it can be very soothing once you learn to slow down. It also doesn’t need to be performed in a vacuum. Put on some music, listen to or read a book, browse the net, watch some tv, or even hang out with another person.\n\nThis guide from Just Primal Things does an outstanding job of explaining the whats and hows of performing mechanical cleaning.\n\n[https://justprimalthings.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/](https://justprimalthings.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/)\n\nA small addition is needed to explain how to preen either short hair or curly hair, as both require slightly different techniques.\n\n## Preening Short Hair\n\nFor extremely short hair, like a buzz cut, you might not need to preen at all. Gently massaging your scalp with the pads of your fingers might be sufficient. If you find you need to preen, it is performed with the palm of the hand. Gently but firmly rub your palm along your scalp, following the general grain of the hair. You should not be pressing very hard, or irritating the scalp with quick, random, painful movements. Smooth, firm motions to spread and lift the oils are best.\n\nFor hair that is a little longer, make the motion like you are running your fingers through your hair, but instead of finishing the motion, close your fingers firmly so strands are caught between them and gently pull your hand away from your scalp. Continue until all your hair has been nicely preened.\n\n## Preening Curly Hair When Dry\n\nHere is a short video that includes an explanation of the process. It involves separating out a curl clump and drawing it around and through the fingers while using the thumb and first finger to do the main preening. Wet preening can often be done like the guide shows, drawing the fingers straight down the section of hair, usually with water running through your hair.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gm9v6k/preening\\_curly\\_hair/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gm9v6k/preening_curly_hair/)\n\nIf you have coily or kinky hair, you can still do water washing, but you might need to modify your routine even further. There are quite a few videos on YouTube about how to work with this kind of hair too!\n\n## Cleaning your tools\n\nCleaning is easy, but needs to be done shortly after you've used the tool, so it has time to dry before you use it again. Sometimes they can even just be dry cleaned with another brush or comb. Cleanser can be anything that cleans. Dish soap, shampoo, clay, baking soda, etc. Just make sure your cleanser doesn't have silicone in it either!\n\nFor a bristle brush, pull all the shed hairs out of the brush, and then get it wet and spread some cleanser across the bristles. Ground the tips of the bristles in the palm of your hand and gently move the brush in a circular motion so all the surfaces of the bristles get cleaned. Use a fine toothed comb between each row of bristles, combing up through the bristles on either side to remove lint and fuzz. Rinse really well so all of the cleanser is removed from between the bristle clumps and let the brush dry in a ventilated area with the bristles pointing down so water doesn't collect in the bristle plugs.\n\nFor combs or pin brushes, you can use a soft scrub brush to dry clean them and lift the built up sebum and fuzz. Or you can wash them by spreading some cleanser on the item and then use a soft scrub brush to clean between the tines or pins of the item, making sure you scrub at multiple angles to get everything clean. Rinse well and place the brush in a ventilated area with the bristles pointing down so that it can drain and dry properly.\n\nYou can clean wooden or horn items the same way you clean plastic. The brief exposure to water won't damage them, but don't let them soak.\n\nLet everything dry in a ventilated area. Don't put them in a cupboard or drawer or bag when wet as that will slow the drying and encourage the growth of mold.\n\n## Customize Your Routine\n\nSpend a few weeks settling into your new water only routine and practicing your mechanical cleaning techniques. Massage and preen, both dry and wet, **with cool or warm water running through the section of hair you are preening under the shower**, which is very effective at cleaning out excess oils and debris like lint and dust. If you are massaging your scalp when wet, do that under the water also, but **be very sure that you are being gentle** so you don’t damage it or unnecessarily loosen hair, causing it to come out before it’s ready to shed. When your hair is dry, detangle and then brush properly **in sections at multiple angles**. Keep the oils moving so they coat your hair, doing their job of conditioning, sealing and protecting it and so they don’t start to smell. If you've ever heard the old saying about brushing 100 strokes a day for healthy hair, this is why.\n\nAfter a while, you might run into some problems. Solve them as they actually happen, rather than anticipating and applying a solution you might not need. This will keep things simple, and allow you to slowly build your customized no-poo routine, developed specifically for your individual environment, biology, needs, presentability and preferences.\n\n## Simple Tests, Valuable Information\n\nYou need to learn some valuable information about your biology and environment that will help you choose proper methods and ingredients to care for your hair and avoid damage.\n\nThere is more information on all of these later in the guide.\n\n## Porosity\n\nYou need to learn the porosity of your hair because it affects how your hair reacts to almost everything in no-poo. The two most popular tests that you can find on the internet, the float and strand tests, are both notoriously inaccurate. Here is an easy quiz to help you figure it out.\n\n[https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/](https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/)\n\n## Protein\n\nYou need to learn how to test for protein so you can know if your hair needs protein to be strong and supple, or if protein needs to be avoided so it doesn’t become dry and brittle.\n\nWhen you are in the shower and your hair is wet, take a shed strand and stretch it. Hair with the proper amount of protein should stretch about 20% before it stops, and should return to its original length when released. If it stretches more, it needs protein. If less, you want to avoid it.\n\n## Hard Water\n\nYou need to learn whether you have hard water, because it makes almost everything no-poo more difficult, and knowing what you have to work with will help with expectations. If there is mineral build up around your sinks, faucets, kettle or coffee pot, you have hard water. You can look up a hard water map of your area for a general idea of whether your dwelling has it. Your water provider’s web site should have it posted, if not you can call and ask.. If you want to spend a little money, there are at home test strips that you can buy.\n\nHere's a thread with lots of information about hard water and how to deal with it.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/mtm6te/faq_hard_water_wax_and_natural_nopoo/\n\n# Transition: a Small Step to a New Lifestyle\n\nNow that you’ve started your no-poo routine, you’re going to experience what is called transition. This is the period of time in between the point when you slowed or stopped using shampoo and other products and finally stabilize into your customized no-poo routine. Depending on your product history, biology and approach to transition, it can typically last from 2-6 months.\n\nIt is a time of healing, finding a natural balance, and retraining your sebum production to be in sync with that natural balance. This is also often a difficult time because of all the new things you are experiencing and learning. It doesn’t help that your scalp kinda freaks out during this process and might become excessively oily, waxy, smelly, dry, flaky, and could break out a little too. This will pass as transition does, even if it takes longer than you really want it to, and your scalp and hair will be healthier for it.\n\n## A Natural Kind of Clean\n\nNo-poo isn’t just about learning to wash your hair with only water or your kitchen cupboard, it’s about embracing your bodys’ natural functions and environment. Modern society and advertising has us convinced that horrible things will happen to us if we don’t spend tons of money on their products. If we don’t use antibacterial soap, we will get horribly sick. If we don’t use highly fragranced shampoo, body wash and deodorant we will be rank and offensive. If we don’t use tons of styling products, our hair will be dry and ugly.\n\nSo we destroy our bodys’ natural protections, both the acidic oily lipid barrier and the beneficial symbiotic microflora, in favor of something that kills everything but the most resilient pathogens, which are then free to multiply because they have nothing left to compete with. Those highly fragranced body products are filled with chemicals and we have very little understanding of how they affect us and our planet, and quite a few people spend their lives battling irritation and sickness because of them. We wash our hair with shampoo, which is too drying, and then try to compensate for that with conditioner, which is filled with things like silicone and liquid plastics that can only be removed by the shampoo. Then we add even more product with texturizers and styling creams, hair spray, mousse, gel, pomade...all in the attempt to replace what the shampoo stripped away in the first place.\n\nHair that is allowed to be itself is textured, interesting, healthy, easy to manage, and properly moisturized. Getting it there can be a bit of a trial, and part of that trial is modifying your ingrained expectations about what ‘clean’ is and how it feels.\n\nModern society defines ‘clean’ as stripped and sterile. But sterile is impossible in a living environment. There is quite a lot of research being done on how vital our microflora is to the health of our skin and the overall wellbeing of our bodies. Microflora is being used to treat chronic conditions like eczema, psoriasis, allergies, and many other conditions, and is having remarkable results.\n\nNo-poo defines ‘clean’ as healthy and comfortable. Being clean is **not** having dry, chapped, stripped skin that must be soothed by a multitude of creams and products, nor hair that is stripped and beaten into submission with chemicals and coatings. Clean is having a healthy body with its natural protections in place, and hair that is properly supported by those natural protections. Clean is knowing how those protections work, and what to do to support them and maintain your own personal sanitation. Clean is encouraging your symbiotic bacteria and understanding that they fight pathogens for you, that they are not the enemy but your allies. Clean is understanding the purpose of sebum: that it conditions, protects, seals in moisture, and learning to love the feeling of it in your hair, and embracing the comfort of knowing it’s doing its job.\n\nSebum is **not** bad or unhealthy, it is the best thing for your skin, scalp and hair. Transition is **not an endurance contest or a race.** It is a small step towards a more natural, healthy lifestyle. Choosing to embrace transition will help you modify your expectations and make it much easier in the end. You could look at the excess sebum as a new product you’re trying out and learn to work with it instead of just wishing it away. If you get some on your hands, just rub it in like lotion. Or you could rub it somewhere you’re dry, like your elbows or forearms. You might find that you enjoy the result of having your natural conditioning oil on your hands and body, protecting you from the things you interact with. It is a customized product that is just for you. And best of all: free!\n\nYou might also consider exploring washing your body with only water and experiencing the benefit of a body that is entirely naturally clean, but discussing that in detail is beyond the purpose of this wiki.\n\n## Things That Affect Transition\n\nThe kind of transition you have is dependent on so many variables it’s difficult to know what each individual will experience. We do know that the type of product you’ve been using and the frequency in which you’ve been using it will greatly affect the duration and severity of transition. How hard your water is can also affect it, but only because hard water makes everything no-poo more difficult.\n\nSurfactant cleansers (detergent based shampoos and conditioners) are classified by how stripping and drying they are:\n\n* Dandruff Shampoo: extremely stripping, drying, and harshly exfoliating. It is trying to remove everything that the fungus might feed on and starve it out as well as using medication to kill it. Using it is often a vicious cycle because of its drying and exfoliating properties. When you quit using dandruff shampoo, the scalp often explodes in a cloud of flakes because it is dry and irritated and no longer being exfoliated. This often prompts the user to start using it again, which suppresses the flakes again. Often the only way to quit dandruff shampoo is to accept that flakes will happen while your scalp heals and give it the support and moisture it needs to do so.\n* Sulfate shampoo: defined by the inclusion of sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. Sulfates are known to be very stripping of oils in the skin and are also irritants that cause dry, damaged skin.\n* Low-poo: defined by the lack of sulfate surfactants, but still containing other surfactants. Because it lacks sulfates, it cannot reliably remove silicones and product buildup caused by liquid plastics. A proper low poo also does not have parabens, water insoluble silicones or drying alcohols in it. Much gentler than sulfate shampoo, but still stripping because of the surfactants.\n* Co-wash: a conditioner that contains no sulfates, parabens, water insoluble silicones or drying alcohols. Classified as low-poo. Still contains surfactants, but also contains moisturizers which reduces the irritation caused by stripping greatly, and so is much gentler than any shampoo.\n\nThe duration between washes also plays a big part in how bad transition will be. If you’ve washed every day, transition will be worse than if you’ve only washed once a week.\n\nHard water turns oils into ‘wax’. This will make your hair stiff, sticky, difficult to brush and comb, and can dry out your hair because the wax coats it and doesn’t let moisture in.\n\nAll of this can allow you to make some intelligent choices about things you can expect and how you want to approach transition. **In the end, however, the best way to handle transition is** **any** **way that gets you through it.** Too many people treat it like that endurance contest that was mentioned earlier, and this often causes them to give up and quit. Don’t worry about how long it will take. Don’t worry about whether doing something will set you back. It all evens out in the end, and if you keep pursuing it, you will get there eventually! It’s better to do what you feel you need to rather than believing you have to just tough it out and then giving up because you can’t.\n\n## How to Handle Transition\n\nIf you’ve been doing something that will make transition more intense, the best way to approach it is slowly and intentionally. A nice low-poo or co-wash can greatly help during the difficult parts of transition by removing the extreme overproduction of oils while your scalp heals from the dryness and irritation of dandruff shampoo or sulfate over-use while still looking and feeling presentable. r/curlyhair has an extensive list of good low-poo and co-wash products that will all be suitable for this. There is also an ingredient checker linked in the sidebar there, and another one at [www.isitcg.com](http://www.isitcg.com/) that can help you find products that aren't on their list.\n\nHere's a broad overview of steps that can ease transition.\n\nIf you haven't been using something that will make your transition more intense, you can step into this list at any point that looks comfortable to you.\n\n* Begin with a clarifying wash, as low-poo cannot reliably remove silicones.\n* Choose not to worry about how long this will take, just take each step when it feels comfortable to do so. Part of no-poo is about learning to listen to what your body needs and taking responsibility for your own individual needs.\n\n1. Wash as often as you need with your new product. Add in moisture treatments, healing herbal drenches and scalp massage if needed to deal with dryness and flakes. If you're quitting dandruff shampoo, there will likely be a time of oiliness and flakes that even the low poo won't help with completely. Submerging your hair and gently swishing it around can be very effective at removing them. You will also need lots of moisture during this time, and gentle scalp massage can help lift the flakes and stimulate healing. This step might take several months, because dandruff shampoo or daily sulfate use are both quite damaging and there could be a lot of healing involved.\n2. Start keeping a cup in the shower and use it to dilute your low-poo. Use only as much as you need to get clean. Products are often far too strong, and that’s part of what makes them so stripping.\n3. Start doing water only washes in place of some low-poo washes to learn and practice your new mechanical cleaning skills. Slowly phase out the use of your low-poo.\n4. If you choose to pursue sebum retraining, start spacing your washes out. Wait until you feel you would normally wash, and then wait another day.\n5. Start always doing water only washes. You might need to wash more frequently when you reach this step, and that’s ok. Wash as often as you like. If you want to pursue alternative washing, this is a good time to start experimenting with that also. Don’t be afraid to use your low-poo to help clean up experiments either. During this step, pay attention to the health of your scalp. If you need to clean it a little more, try gently massaging it under the water, just like you’ll be preening under the water. But it can be delicate, so be gentle when you do. You might also need to add in some moisture treatments as your scalp heals from the low-poo you’ve been using.\n\n* Address any problems that develop, like dealing with hard water waxiness or needing more moisture in your routine.\n\nThis is a simple, methodical approach that will allow you to ease into no-poo while still feeling clean and looking presentable. There is no need for the discomfort of feeling endlessly disgusting, and struggling through that will only make it more likely that you won't make it through transition at all.\n\nYou also don't ever need to worry about doing something that will ruin your transition, it can't happen. Even if you end up with silicone on your hair and have to do a sulfate wash to remove it, you still won't ruin your transition. You have been healing and rebalancing, that is progress that doesn't disappear with one mistake. The only thing you could do to ruin your progress is to go back to full overuse of damaging products again, and even that would take a while.\n\n## Straight to Water Only\n\nThe quickest approach to transition is cold turkey, where you do a final clarifying wash and then just go straight to water only washing once a week. If you haven’t been doing something that will make your transition more intense, you might choose to try this approach, but don’t feel like you are locked into it. Remember, **any approach to transition that gets you through it is completely valid.** With this approach, transition typically lasts 2-4 months. This is also the most difficult for a variety of reasons.\n\nMost people are not experienced with mechanical cleaning and are learning a whole new skill set. Most people are used to the ease of using shampoo and are not used to the work that mechanical cleaning requires, so often don't perform it properly or sufficiently. Added on top of those is the fact that transition itself is difficult because your scalp is freaking out, your sebum is weird, oil is pouring down like it will never stop, and you're only 'allowed' to wash once a week.\n\nThe only way to deal with this is excessive dry mechanical cleaning every single day, with lots of quality time spent with your boar bristle brush (and then be sure to clean the brush!) **Even if you do this, you will probably still look oily for 2-3 months.** Washing can help, but it's difficult to remove a weeks' worth of oils, especially for people who are just learning how to perform mechanical cleaning in the shower.\n\nScalp health is key in no-poo, but most especially during this approach. All the oils that your scalp is flushing so that it can heal are sitting on your scalp and in your hair all week and can cause a lot of problems if they aren't dealt with. They can create an environment for fungal, yeast or bacterial infections, and under the right circumstances, hair loss. If you have a huge excess of oils on your scalp, you absolutely must do the gentle scalp massage frequently to keep them moving.\n\nThis approach can be softened and made significantly easier by water only washing more often than just once a week, especially in the beginning. This allows you to practice your in shower mechanical cleaning and will help remove oils, keep your scalp clean and allow you to be more presentable. There are even reports of people who washed every day during their transition and they say they believe it was easier for them because of it. Adding in alternative washing methods when needed can be helpful also, to break up transition wax, or just to remove large quantities of sebum and allow you to have a break from the super oily hair for a few days. Washing more often will extend the retraining aspect of transition, but will make the early part much easier to deal with.\n\nNo-poo is not a short term project, it’s a long term lifestyle choice. It is not a race to see how fast you can finish transition, the ultimate goal is to make it through transition so that you can enjoy your healthy no-poo hair.\n\n## The Two Pieces of Transition\n\nThere are two main things that happen during the time we call transition. There is the time of healing which is the main part of transition, and there is the intentional retraining of sebum production.\n\n## Flushing and Healing\n\nYou have spent years putting things on your scalp that harshly strips your natural oils away, and then put more things on your hair and scalp to try to compensate for this. These things contain many different chemicals that react with you, your environment, and each other in a vast variety of different ways, often causing irritation at the minimum and sometimes serious damage. They have also unbalanced the natural environment of your scalp and hair in serious ways. All of this needs to be corrected and healed, which takes a while and can cause weird things to happen to your scalp and sebum while it works itself out.\n\nThis is a healing time for your scalp. If you have been seriously sick for many years and finally found a treatment that made you better, you would expect it to take a while to heal. Your scalp has the same needs. We aren't talking weeks here, we are talking **months**.\n\nExpectations are powerful. We are trying to supply you with information that is as accurate as possible, so that you can form your expectations based on that. When you see a video on YouTube saying that they did water only for two weeks and showing how awesome their hair is, it's extremely likely their transition hasn't even gotten started yet. Sometimes it can take up to a month or longer for the weirdness to start. But it sets up expectations that transition isn’t such a big deal, which isn't true at all for the vast majority of people.\n\nThere are also people who try no-poo for 4-6 weeks, and then post how horrible it is and how it doesn’t work because their hair is terrible. Even if they have been performing mechanical cleaning properly (many of them haven’t), they are still in transition, and shouldn’t be expecting anything different. But it is probable that they turn a lot of people who were interested in no-poo away from trying it, because ‘it didn’t work for that YouTuber so it’s a scam’.\n\nSome potential milestones during transition, especially if going straight to water only:\n\nAfter the first few washes when your sebum is starting to become weird, you will probably encounter the waxy stage. This is where your hair is stiff, sticky, tangles easily, is difficult to comb or brush and leaves white or grey sticky residue on your tools. This also happens if you have hard water, because it turns oils into ‘wax’. A warm applesauce mask applied for about 30 minutes and then combed out under the shower water can help lift the waxiness. You may have to apply it several times to fully lift the wax. Brushing excessively over the course of several days will also lift it.\n\nThe super oily stage is almost universal, where your hair is saturated with sebum and looks wet and limp and everyone must think you’re a grease monster, but it’s surprisingly soft and easy to comb or brush. Keeping the oil moving with preening and brushing is important so that it doesn’t build up and smell.\n\nYou might encounter the “my wash method is making me lose all my hair” stage where you learn how much hair you actually shed every day but have never noticed. Shedding about 100 hairs a day is normal, but when you’re using shampoo they usually drift away during the day. When you go no-poo and your hair is oily, they stick together instead and only come out during a brushing or washing session, so you see them all at once.\n\nAfter a while of trying no-poo and dealing with the overproduction of sebum for weeks on end, you might reach the point where you want to quit because you feel it’s never going to get better, and you’re going to need encouragement to push through. Find a friend or come post on r/nopoo and share your frustrations, the community is very supportive and encouraging!\n\n## Retraining Sebum Production\n\nOften people have been stripping their hair and scalp with harsh chemicals every day for years. Your scalp compensates by producing a large quantity of sebum, attempting to do its job of protecting and conditioning your hair. It has been trained that this over production needs to happen because of the daily stripping, and so needs to be retrained that it's not going to be harshly stripped any more and can start producing a more balanced amount of sebum. This is done by delaying washes that remove sebum from the scalp in any way, including dry shampoo, allowing your natural biofeedback to realize that there is plenty of sebum on your scalp and eventually it will stop producing so much.\n\nIf you choose to be less intentional about retraining, there are some reports that sebum production will eventually reduce even if you wash with a no-poo method every day. It will just happen at its own pace instead of being encouraged to happen more quickly.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHere is a FAQ that is in the works.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/lt9c9z/nopoo\\_faq\\_and\\_general\\_information/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/lt9c9z/nopoo_faq_and_general_information/)\n\nHere's the links to the previous postings.

How much mechanical cleaning should I expect to do once fully transitioned?\n\nI’ve been working on going no-poo for about three months and I’ve got to a stage where my scalp feels pretty good and clean (not clogged and “wet” with oil like in the beginning), and my hair, especially the roots and crown, feel oily and dense and flat in the evenings, but when I wake up in the mornings it’s much better. I want to know if this is as good as it’s going to get or if the sebum levels will calm down and even out further.",

        "body": "Thank you for writing this! I realized that back when I was around 12 years old, I was already doing no poo and it was fantastic for my hair. I would shampoo my hair maybe once or twice the whole month and I grew my hair so long then. But as I got a bit older and started watching youtube + discovering social media, as someone with semi kinky curly hair, I fell for so many marketing fads. Thinking certain products would grow my hair better than my routine I had for a couple years of water only washing and the occasional shampoo. I think that I will return back to water only washing because of this chunk of info you wrote! So I appreciate it so much. I always thought I was just gross and crazy for doing this at one point even though my hair never showed signs of damage. I swam everyday too. I would cowash sometimes but never really on a schedule. I remember my mom being so grossed out by the fact that I used to rarely use soap, even less than I do now. I would use soap on the days where I was super sweaty and felt gross after a work out but I still find myself just using water on my body because my skin gets so sensitive and just cannot handle soap sometimes, especially ones with sulfates as I’m slowly trying to use up these products in any ways other than on my body such as cleaning items like hair brushes. I find that using soap on my armpits is the only place I apply soap if my skin is feeling a bit dried out.\n\nI was wondering about some aspects though.\n\n1) You mentioned ACV and I currently do use ACV once a week diluted with water and peppermint + tea tree oil on the day where I’ve been exercising and sweating heavily. Do you think that I could use ACV in place of a shampoo or would that affect my scalp just as badly as a shampoo? Because I wash my hair once a week with shampoo, could I just use ACV that day in its place? \n\n2) Is it actually bad to go no poo but then occasionally use a shampoo? Like once or twice a month as I mentioned? I switched to “sulfate free” shampoos this past year which I only use the ones without silicones (which has always been a big thing for me because silicones tend to irritate my skin for some reason) (and i even cut out sulfates in my toothpaste because they would cause me canker sores very often and ever since i switched to sulfate free cruelty free brand i only get a canker sore from my other triggers like oranges) and normally have the cocamidopropyl betaine in it. You said that there’s no proper way to transition but I was just wondering can it set back your process in any way after you’ve already transitioned? Or even right now, I like to do hot oil treatments and need a shampoo to rinse avocado oil off my scalp because I don’t want my scalp suffocated by oil. Do you recommend just using up the rest of my oils + shampoos and then going no poo or only doing hot oil treatments every two weeks or what is your opinion on this? I’ve seen hair growth from using hot oil treatments and massaging my scalp when I do them once a week but I feel like I can’t do them anymore if I go no poo because I feel the need to use a shampoo. Felt better asking rather than being sorry down the line. \n\n\n3) Would a brush similar to the tangle teaser be good for spreading the sebum on the hair? specifically the detangling brush by crave naturals. it’s my favorite hairbrush!\n\nThank you for helping us all out!",

So now because my hair is so greasy it itches after like 1 day so on the 2 day mark i wash it again. If i get this clarifying wash thing will it reset the process. Is there anything that will help with the greasy and itchiness. And i haven’t really seen anyone aak this but how do you get your haircut because its what i am going to be doing but i don’t want to have greasy and itchy hair there so i will most likely use shampoo and wait for my hair to un-poof then start again.",

    "body": "Hi all, I've put this off for too long but I'd like to help anyone I can to save their teeth. I spent a decade in restaurants before going back to school to become a dental hygienist. I work in public health, in a community health center and many of my patients are restaurant workers. \n\nI've combined my experience in the kitchen with my training & experience to target specific risk factors you should look out for. Please be aware, the nature of kitchen/restaurant work places you at far higher risk for dental disease than most other occupations. This, coupled with the fact that people are rarely provided any sort of benefits or even decent pay to see a dentist regularly, means you will always have an uphill battle here. \n\nThere is little you can do to prevent dental disease in this industry, but hopefully if you follow my advice, you can drastically reduce your risk by being aware of your habits. In order to so, you have to understand what dental disease actually is. \n\nDecay and Cavities\n\n* Your teeth are living crystals, with the outermost layer known as enamel which is non-vital, the bulk of the tooth dentin which is more organic, and the pulp which is fully vital nerves. They're formed by cells from the outer surface > inwards. These cells then die. There is absolutely no way to regenerate enamel, once it is gone it's gone forever. Dentin closer to the pulp has a very limited capacity to regenerate. If anything happens to the pulp, the tooth is not salvageable, necessitating a root canal or extraction.\n* Decay is the process that leads to cavities. Our mouth is full of bacteria, they're part of us, and there's no getting rid of it. With good hygiene and good dietary habits, it's relatively well controlled. When you consume almost ANY sugar/carbohydrates, the bacteria in your mouth use this as energy to proliferate and spread. The waste product is acid. This acid breaks down the outermost layer of your teeth, whether that be enamel or dentin, causing a demineralized state. This state lasts for up to 45 minutes PER exposure before your teeth surfaces begin to remineralize from the minerals present in your saliva. This is a normal process and it only becomes a problem when the demineralized periods exceed the resting periods and your saliva can't keep up with the acid attacks. Cavities happen when decay breaks down structure to the point that it can't be remineralized any longer and you have actual holes in your teeth. This is a rapidly progressing disease once it gets to this point, eventually making it's way to the pulp if unaddressed. You will not always feel pain from this, even in a late stage, so it can often go unnoticed for years. Some are more susceptible to pain/sensitivity, but everyone is different. \n\nGingivitis and Periodontitis\n\n* They are both different stages of gum disease. Gingivitis is basic inflammation of the gums that hasn't progressed to permanent damage. Gingivitis is your body's immune response to excessive/aggressive bacteria around your gums, producing bleeding/heat/pain/swelling. There are varying degrees to this, from mild & painless, to excessively profuse pain/bleeding/swelling. Periodontitis is what happens when gingivitis progresses to a point where your body responds to the irritating factors by destroying the bone/ligaments that hold your teeth in place. This is usually a slow process but certain cases can progress rapidly under the right conditions. This is the #1 reason that people lose their teeth completely. Poor hygiene is the primary cause for this, but other factors that are important are stress, both physical and mental, genetics (though not how you might think), etc. \n\nBruxism/Grinding.\n\n* This deserves special mention as it is especially stress induced. Teeth clenching/grinding can/will wear out your teeth with symptoms that often extend beyond the mouth, affecting your temperomandibular joint (TMJ), resulting in temperomandibular disease (TMD) in more severe cases.\n\nWhy are restaurant workers more susceptible to disease than others?\n\n* Every position in a restaurant has heightened risk due to their normal duties. Front of the house and management is no exception, everyone must practice heightened prevention measures.\n\n* Tasting. Tasting is the biggest culprit/cause of cavities and it's practically unavoidable. Every time you taste something that has even a modicum of fermentable carbs/sugars, it instantly feeds the bacteria in your entire mouth. This is unavoidable. That little spoonful of tasting a sauce, a piece of something, etc. kickstarts that 45 minutes demineralization cycle. Every single time. Most cooks are going to be tasting throughout their entire shift meaning that the acid cycle **NEVER STOPS**. This applies to a lesser, but still significant extent to servers/runners. But it also applies heavily to bartenders that are always tasting drinks that are full of sugar/liquor. There's almost no way to avoid this while still being able to do your job.\n\n* Drinks. Try to only drink water when you're working on the line, or running plates, on the bar, etc. If you must drink something like a soda, try to only drink diet so that you don't have sugar that'll feed the bacteria in your mouth. **NEVER, EVER, EVER PUT LEMON/LIME/ANY CITRUS IN YOUR WATER.** This turns the entire drink into an acid bath and it WILL erode your teeth causing permanent damage over time.\n\n* Stress is something we all experience in the kitchen, and I argue that it's far higher than many other occupations because it's both mental and physical. Physical stress is multifaceted. Being in a hot kitchen for 12 hours with little time to actually sit and eat, so all you do is pick/snack. Stress when countless tickets are firing and you're rushing through everything, you clench your teeth, your body is in a rush, etc. This stress increases inflammation reactions in your body. Gum disease becomes worse. Stress from getting home tired. Not getting enough sleep. Not making enough money. All of this is a burden on your body and weakens your immune system. Gingivitis/periodontitis respond and become worse rapidly with stress.\n\n* Time. When you're working doubles, two jobs, doing everything you can to stay afloat, one thing you just don't have the luxury of is free time. Time to relax is important. Time to go see the dentist is scarce when your shifts overlap with normal office hours, if you can even afford to go. What little time you have is spent so hard on recuperation that sometimes you don't even have the willpower/energy to take care of yourself properly.\n\n* Coverage. Those blessed few workers who have insurance, likely have awful insurance that may not even cover dental. But the true joke is that dental insurance is barely adequate for what you may need. Calling it insurance is practically a lie, it's more of a discount program that often pigeonholes you into just a few clinics that accept it.\n\nSo what can you do?\n\n* Basic homecare is something that we can all do, you just have to find the time and energy to doing so. You have to make yourself do it. Not doing so will cost you far more than anything else. \n\n* Brushing. [Watch this video for proper brushing technique.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm9c5HAUBpY) It's so simple and yet, so simple to get wrong with the wrong angle. One thing this video fails to mention and nobody ever seems to know is that when you're brushing your upper molars, the side facing your cheeks, you must keep your mouth mostly closed. The wider you open, the more that your cheeks will become taut and actually block your brush from reaching the furthest areas. This is one of the most common spots missed. Use a soft toothbrush. If you can afford an electric toothbrush, get one. I don't care how good of a brusher you think you are, it's always better. [This is an excellent brush that isn't too expensive. There isn't very much special about pricier brushes.](https://www.amazon.com/Oral-B-1000-Rechargeable-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B003UKM9CO/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=oral+b+professional&qid=1579563702&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWFVaRkFWNjZWMyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMDM4NjUxNzFPTUtTMlI5RkxZTVUmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDUwMTQ1NDFERVdHRkVPWlczSUImd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) \n\n* Cleaning in between your teeth is not exclusive to floss. In fact, I rarely recommend floss anymore unless I'm confident that the person can do it properly and is willing to do so. It's very technique sensitive, and I would say most people hate to do so. There are lots of options, many of which are just as good as if not better than floss. My two most common recommendations are [interdental brushes](https://www.amazon.com/Interdental-Toothpick-Flossing-Hygiene-Cleaning/dp/B074M3Y38N/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2Y8G0WWYMUBRF&keywords=interdental+brush&qid=1579564036&sprefix=interdental+b%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-6) and [GUM softpicks](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Picks-Dental-Picks-Advanced-Count/dp/B06ZZYMXMW/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?crid=MW8B7821TWSC&keywords=gum+soft+picks&qid=1579564104&sprefix=gum+soft+picks%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-3-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTE9HOFdHUlpSTlRDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjgxNTM3TzhJM0o1MVkwMUk1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNjk1MzcxVEdER0ZDMUpLQVFMJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==). Both of these are reusable until they warp/break. I often recommend that you separate brushing and using these or flossing. Keep these, or floss, where you relax at home. If you're on the couch watching TV, keep it right there. If you're on a computer, keep it on your desk. You don't have to brush and get in between your teeth at the same time, so long as you actually do it. If you keep it where you're relaxing, you're more likely to do it and less likely to rush through it. Waterpiks are also a decent option, but people tend to stop using them eventually and they collect dust under a sink. They do work though.\n\n* Toothpaste. Always, always, always use a fluoride toothpaste. Anything negative you've heard about fluoride is likely misrepresented, grossly exaggerated, or an outright lie. There is NO reason not to use a fluoride toothpaste, absolutely none. I won't entertain any troll/conspiracy comments about it either, so please do not attempt to spread misinformation. The way fluoride works is it strengthens the outermost layer of your teeth and makes it more resistant to acid. This is the single most important thing next to proper hygiene to prevent dental disease. Fluoride toothpaste alone reduces your risk of getting cavities by about 35%. You need every bit of help as a kitchen worker, so don't set yourself up for regret by using some kind of alternative, they DO NOT work. Most fluoride pastes are basically the same, so don't fall for marketing hype. If your teeth are sensitive, use a toothpaste that says sensitivity on it. These have a ramp-up of two weeks and you must stick with it, or the effects wear off after two weeks. Don't get sensodyne, it's overhyped garbage. Arm & Hammer sensitive is the best deal. \n\n* Mouthwash on it's own will do nothing for you if you're not brushing & getting in between correctly. For the most part, all it does is keep bacteria less populous, temporarily. However! A good fluoride mouthwash can be your best friend as a cook. It's something you can do quickly, you can even keep a tiny bottle in your pocket and rinse with it periodically throughout your shift without stopping what you're doing and spit it into the garbage. This does have the unfortunate side effect of taste alteration. Most toothpaste and mouthwashes contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which blocks sweet flavor reception on your tongue. This can be a big deal, and it lasts for about half an hour or so after rinsing, so do so with caution. (This mouthwash is a bit pricey at about $10 per bottle, but it will neutralize acid, remineralize your teeth, and it won't alter your taste perception so it's probably the best option.)[https://www.amazon.com/CloSYS-Silver-2-Count-Fluoride-Mouthwash/dp/B01M347XMA/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=Cj0KCQiAvJXxBRCeARIsAMSkAprJPvFxrCbKpqYwHRDAQdDLJMwpU_Xjl4kmSg-amPmfXpKSwlHK06MaAjTEEALw_wcB&hvadid=177572987460&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9004333&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t3&hvqmt=e&hvrand=4663112191069579555&hvtargid=aud-836690481282%3Akwd-280789591650&hydadcr=28226_10142495&keywords=closys+silver&qid=1579565311&sr=8-1]\n\n* Xylitol chewing gum or mints are another great thing you can have in your pocket to reduce risk throughout the day. You want to have at least 5 pieces per day, but it's usually good to have one after any tasting session, snack or meal is done. Any brand works so long as it's primarily sweetened with xylitol. This sugar kills the bacteria that causes cavities and the chewing/saliva flow will help clear out acids faster. If you're having too much of it right away, you might get the shits. Slow it down a bit and you'll get used to it in about a week with no further complications. \n\n* Coverage. Like I said earlier, few people have decent insurance, let alone dental insurance. That doesn't mean you shouldn't see the dentist. There are a number of great options for getting your dental needs taken care of that can be very cheap. There are clinics similar to mine are sponsored by federal government to provide affordable care to anyone in need. They're called Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers. You can go there if you're uninsured, on medicaid, etc. Some take limited private insurance. If you have uncovered services, you will be charged a fee according to a sliding income scale. In my clinic, uncovered services are free of charge if you make up to 110% of poverty level income, and scale upwards from there. There is no obligation to pay up front so you can always receive care. You can search for these clinics easily by looking up keywords like \"FQHC, community health center\" in your local area and find one that has a dental clinic. There are thousands throughout the country. Dental schools are considerably cheaper than private dental clinics. There is also the relative assurance that you are not being exploited or lied to about what you need, you can almost guarantee an unbiased assessment at a school. Dental hygiene schools are another option, you can get preventive treatment and xrays for very small sums of money. You can't however get restorative treatment like fillings/etc. there.  It's mostly for cleanings, gum disease treatment, education and referrals.\n\nIn conclusion, while you might be at a very high risk, much of these factors can be somewhat controlled with some conscious effort. Spend that little bit of extra money to save you more down the line, invest in yourself early. No job is worth sacrificing your health for, so don't feel an obligation to put the kitchen before your own health and sanity.",

        "body": "Good read.  A few thoughts from a non-dentist/non-chef I'd like to add for your consideration and potential revision though:\n\n1. Manual vs Electric Toothbrush:  The health of my teeth went way up when I made this switch, but it also resulted in gum recession for a half dozen teeth.  Obviously, this comes down to technique.  Since you recommend an electric toothbrush, I'd strongly encourage your giving a video technique that corresponds to that, as opposed to a manual toothbrush technique.  Understanding the right level of pressure is non-intuitive for those uneducated in the manner, as I had been.  At the very least, adding a line that aggressive brushing can cause gum recessions, leading to potential surgery, is certainly worth pointing out.  As for the manual toothbrushes, mentioning getting a \"soft\" one replaced every 3 months would be good, too.\n2. Mouthwash:  You may wish to add a couple sentences on non-alcohol being preferable, as well as notating the added value of acidulated phosphate (e.g. sodium/disodium phosphate), which aids in the reuptake of fluoride into the enamel.  Without other changes, adopting ACT rinse on its own actually showed an improvement in my X-Rays, due to enhanced fluoride mineralization, meaning my fluoride toothpaste wasn't quite cutting it, even though I'm not a snacker (i.e. 2-4 meals a day)!  (possibly because I drink almost exclusively bottled from a region that doesn't add fluoride)  To be clear, I'm not claiming to have uncovered some holy grail of re-building enamel; I'm merely stating this had a significant enough of an impact in my personal fluoride exposure/aborsption to actually be observable by my dentist via X-Rays (I'd been getting X-rays annually for years with this dentist and out of the blue asked how I improved my teeth, before she even took a look in my mouth)\n3. Waterpik:  Don't knock it so quickly!  I've tried floss, interdental brushes, and gum soft picks.  None of them worked for me, due to poor compliance on my part.  Once I discovered waterpiks I became a changed man!  3 years strong and the only days I've ever missed was when I was on vacation and didn't pack it!  Part of the reason I also find this habit easier to form is I put a cap-full of ACT rinse into my waterpik and use it before heading into work (so no risk of my eating and having altered taste buds).  That said, I agree with you, waterpiks wouldn't be the first thing I recommend to others, nor traditional floss.  Those with \"permanent\" retainers will also much prefer waterpiks, btw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion:  Why do you state sensodyne is garbage and instead recommend Arm and Hammer for sensitivity toothpaste?  I recently posted in this subreddit asking about this, so am very curious as to your thoughts!",

        "body": "I'm assuming you added quite a bit of soap.\n\nFor your trap, use a half cup of apple cider (I found champagne vinigar works best) and 2 drops of soap. Swirl it around until it's homogeneous. Adding suran wrap with holes helps really get them.\nFlies all day!\n\nAs for your pattern, the soap is what is called an amphipathic molecule. It had polar and nonpolar regions with this long chain molecule. These long molecules in the acidic vinigar solution will want to arrange themselves in the most stable fashion. This would be by having all the polar carboxylic acid and amine groups facing one another or sitting close to one another. The nonpolar alkyl chains will fold or protrude from these \"headgroups\" in such a way as to have the most surface area as possible arranged closely with one anothers nonpolar chains. This is the microscopic effects occurring at the boundary layer with the soap and acid solution. The macroscopic pattern that you see is an emergent effect from as the boundary layers although \"random\" develop stable and unstable regions. This is an effect described in chaos theory as someone had previously stated. It's a REALLY cool thing to check out.\n\nAs for what the right ratio of soap and water do, a SMALL amount of soup. Will break the tight arrangement of all the polar water molecules. This lowers the surface tension because the water molecules can't hang out next to one another. And especially at the surface, those nonpolar regions will display their alkyl chains, making it easier for materials to slip into the water and not be held up by the tight water arrangement. That's why the fruit flies slip into the water so easily.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.), calling it the “Louisiana MAHA bill”—a reference to his own “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) agenda that aims to crack down on food colorants, food additives, and seed oils.\nPer Senate Bill 14, beginning in 2028, Louisiana public schools and nonpublic school receiving state funds will be prohibited from serving in school breakfasts, lunches, and aftercare meals any foods containing one of 15 ingredients:\n\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Azodicarbonamide (ADA)\n- Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)\n- Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)\n- Potassium bromate\n- Propylparaben\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Aspartame\n- Sucralose\n\n\nThe prohibition does not apply to foods sold in vending machines or at concession stands.\nSenate Bill 14 also contains a provision for the disclosure of “harmful ingredients,” which requires labeling of food products to disclose when they contain one of 40+ ingredients, beginning in 2028. The bill also requires foodservice establishments to display disclaimers on their menus or in a visible location when they prepare foods with seed oils (i.e., canola/rapeseed, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils).\n\nRegarding the ingredient disclosure provision, manufacturers must label foods containing any of 40+ ingredients with a QR code directing consumers to a webpage that displays the following disclaimer: “NOTICE: This product contains [ingredient]. For more information about this ingredient, including FDA approvals, click HERE.” The disclaimer must link to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) webpage on food chemical safety. The 40+ ingredients covered by this provision are:\n\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Acetylated esters of mono- and diglycerides (acetic acid ester)\n- Anisole\n- Aspartame\n- ADA\n- BHA\n- BHT\n- Bleached flour\n- Bromated flour\n- Calcium bromate\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Diacetyl\n- Dimethylamylamine (DMAA)\n- Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS)\n- Interesterified palm oil\n- Interesterified soybean oil\n- Lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol\n- Lye\n- Morpholine\n- Olestra\n- Partially hydrogenated oil (PHO)\n- Propylparaben\n- Sodium aluminum sulfate\n- Sodium lauryl sulfate\n- Sodium stearyl fumarate\n- Stearyl tartrate\n- Sucralose\n- Synthetic trans fatty acid\n- Thiodipropionic acid\n- Toluene\n- Potassium aluminum sulfate\n- Potassium bromate\n- Potassium iodate\n- Propylene oxide\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Citrus red dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Certified food colors by FDA\n\nAlthough several states have passed bills inspired by MAHA in recent months—such as Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia—the movement is controversial. Some stakeholders have disputed MAHA claims, calling them “an oversimplification without a clear understanding of the myriad complexities facing the production of safe and nutritious foods” that “ignores current food and animal food regulatory systems designed to promote public and animal health.”",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Upvote if you can if you like and or end up sharing the guide! Thank you! Follow these instructions and be patient—the process can take time, about 2-3 weeks in most cases to be completely mealybug free, but it's effective!!**\n\n**Step 0: Take a deep breath :)**\n\n^(DO NOT USE IF SPIDER MITES PRESENT | [My favorite spider mite treatment video and process](https://youtu.be/PJDLK7Tc8q0?si=cu_U_0Hf0IEO3ZI9))\n\n**Step 1: Assess the Infestation**\n\n1. Light Infestation: For small infestations, you can skip to Step 3, if you would like.\n2. Heavy Infestation: Follow all steps. \n\n**Step 2: (OPTIONAL) Pre-Treatment Shower (Highly Recommended for Heavy Infestations)**\n\n1. Remove Plant from Substrate: Carefully take the affected plant out of its pot.\n2. Hose Down the Plant and Pot: Spray all leaves, nooks, crannies, roots, and the inside and the outside of the pot with strong water pressure. If the pot was on a saucer or stand, spray this off too.\n3. Heat Treatment for Roots (Optional, recommendation for heavy infestations): Soaking roots in hot water can kill mealybugs, but it must be done carefully to avoid harming the plant. Mealybugs are sensitive to high temperatures, but most plants can only tolerate a specific range of heat before their roots or other tissues are damaged. Here’s a safe approach if you want to try hot water treatment.\n   * Water Temperature: Use water at a temperature between 110°F to 120°F (43°C to 49°C). This temperature is typically safe for most plants and effective for killing mealybugs.\n   * Duration: Soak the roots for about 5–10 minutes, monitoring carefully.\n   * Immediate Cooling: After soaking, rinse the roots in room-temperature water to cool them and prevent heat stress on the plant.\n   * If done correctly, this method can help kill mealybugs on the roots, but proceed with caution.\n4. Repot in Clean Substrate OR Repot as soon as you receive the Bonide Systemic Granules (or do both! I can’t stop ya!) (See Step 6 for reference if introducing the Bonide Systemic Granules to the substrate now. Continue reading and applying all following steps though.): If you have fresh soil, repot in it. If not, you may reuse the original soil. Alternative Option: If repotting isn't possible, you can spray the plant thoroughly while it’s still potted. Use a plastic bag to cover the soil, avoiding over-saturation (mealybugs are attracted to moisture).\n\n**Step 3: Quarantine the Affected Plants**\n\n1. Separate Infected Plants: Place them at least 10 feet away from other plants to prevent mealybugs from spreading. Horrifyingly, they can move very quickly from one plant to another, so check plants in the vicinity as well! Also, the males CAN FLY. (WTF!) Arguably even worse, the youngest stages of mealybugs are light enough to easily be carried by air currents!\n2. Clean the prior infected plants location and nearby surfaces with iso alcohol. While they need to consume plant sap to sustain themselves, mealybugs can survive on surfaces for 2-3 WEEKS. So, it’s prudent to check and clean table top/shelf surfaces, table legs/shelf supports, walls, windowsills, blinds, underneath of shelves/surfaces, remove/check clutter, nearby plants. If not cleaned, even after you’ve treated an infected plants location w systemic granules and/or an alcohol/soap spray, mealybugs can make there way over an even longer time period to nearby plants or remain in place to infect any plant that is put in the spot of the previously infected plant. \n\n**Step 4: Start Daily Alcohol Treatment**\n\n1. Prepare Alcohol Solution: Mix 60-70% isopropyl alcohol with a drop or two of dish soap. Two drops of Dawn is perfect for a 750mL bottle of 70% isopropyl alcohol. (See end of protocol for a blurb on soaps! tldr: just go with Dawn.)\n   * [Alcohol Dilution Calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/food/alcohol-dilution)\n   * Note: Dilute the alcohol if treating young or delicate plants, but ideally not below 50%. Many scientific and agricultural sources recommend only spot-treating with alcohol, as it can damage plant tissues, particularly on tender or young plants.\n   * Anecdotal Lesson Learned: I have sprayed entire plants daily in the past with 70%, ensuring lots of good airflow. While larger succulents and bigger hardier stems and roots were not fazed, skinny stems and root systems were dehydrated and destroyed in this process. For example, the stem(s) of my string of pearls, the roots and stems on my smallest jelly bean succulent plants, and the thin stem, esp. around the base where the solution all dripped down to, of some of my smallest succulents. These got dehydrated by the strong concentration. So I recommend to dilute it for delicate plants *or* use a cotton swab/round/puff or what have you to remove the majority of the alcohol solution right after applying so it doesn’t dehydrate the more delicate of plant tissues. \n\n2. Apply Alcohol Solution to Plants: Choose how you will apply the solution. You can use a q-tip to apply the solution or you may spray all plant surfaces, focusing on the undersides of leaves, leaf folds, stem bases, and soil. Check under pots and drainage holes, as mealybugs often hide here. Again, when starting out treating, it is your call whether to spray the whole plant or go in w a qtip removing the bugs. Again, it is your call to spray liberally or spot treat and the plant tissues being treated should be considered. I personally recommend spot treating and use a q-tip w the solution to remove the bugs, rather than applying the solution to the whole plant. If you apply it to the whole plant, make sure there is adequate airflow so the solution can evaporate, or wash it off, or wipe it off w a soft cloth and remove any pooling of the solution in crevices. The solution if left to sit on the plant tissue will dry it out and damage it. So do what you need to do to not let the alcohol solution just sit on plant tissue. Once it comes in contact with mealybug, it kills the mealybug. It does *not* need to sit.\n\n**Step 5: Remove Visible Mealybugs**\n\n1. Inspect Daily: Use close inspection, or a magnifying glass if needed, to locate mealybugs.\n2. Remove Bugs and Webbing: Use a Q-tip dipped in 70% isopropyl alcohol and soap solution to remove visible bugs and their cottony webbing. Be gentle and patient and thorough, and avoid damaging the foliage as you go.\n   * Tip: Check out [photos](https://images.app.goo.gl/qzkNrmwXKSz27vFY7) of mealybugs online in their different life stages to aid in recognizing them on your own plants.\n3. Check Plant Crevices: Look under leaves, in leaf joints, on stems, and within new growth. Use tweezers to gently open new growth if necessary (avoid letting moisture sit in these areas).\n\n**Step 6: Apply Bonide Systemic Granules (Essential for Severe Infestations)**\n\n1. Order Bonide Systemic Granules (4 lb size for larger infestations).\n2. Apply the Granules, either repot or sprinkle even layer on top. If you apply on top, you have to “scratch them into” the top layer. If repotting, repot in fresh soil if available and desired; otherwise, use the original soil if necessary and incorporate/mix granules in the appropriate volume as directed on the container based on plant size into the substrate mix. Next, whether you repotted or just sprinkled the bonide in an even layer on top and scratched it in the top layer to mix it lightly into the top layer of substrate, water the plant via top watering as soon as appropriate, as directed in the Bonide Systemic Granules Instructions, to ensure the product reaches the roots and can be taken up by the plant. \n\n**Step 7: Ongoing Maintenance**\n\n1. Continue Daily Alcohol Sprays/Q-tip removal until you notice fewer bugs or until it has been two weeks or so with the Bonide granules. For light infestations, spray/inspect and remove every 2-3 days.\n2. Regular Inspections: Check the entire plant daily, esp. for bad infestations and at the beginning of the process, especially in crevices and new growth. Continue to remove visible mealybugs and webs.  Inspect gently and do not sacrifice the health of foliage in the aim of manually removing a mealybug; we want to avoid causing the plant any extra stress. Do not ignore the underside of pots! Root mealies often build nests on the bottom of pots and in drainage holes, so these should be checked and, as needed, sprayed with alcohol. Foliage mealies like all those crevices and tight new growth. \n3. Remove Dead Leaves and Debris daily: mealybugs will use these as hiding as well as nesting spots.\n\n# Stay diligent and keep inspecting and cleaning daily while waiting for the Bonide granules to take full effect. Good luck—mealybugs can be defeated!\n\n**\\~End Notes\\~**\n\n*Prioritize your peace.*\n\nIf you want to save a plant from mealybugs, I truly believe you can. The decision to do so is an investment though, it comes down to having the extra time resources, financial resources, and extra bandwidth in daily energy to make it worth saving.  Some plants are so bad (or are easily replaceable for cheaper than all the materials you’d buy for treating) that it’s not worth it! And that’s okay! If you don’t have the mental or fiscal resources to save a plant, it is NOT worth your peace of mind. Save and protect your own peace first. But save your plants if you can too! 💚\n\n*Acknowledgement of outdoor plants and gardens:*\n\nFor an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, incorporating predatory insects like Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (the “mealybug destroyer”) may enhance long-term control, especially for outdoor plants or greenhouses. Quarantining affected plants remains a key step, as mealybugs can quickly spread, especially when aided by ants that “farm” mealybugs for honeydew. Managing nearby ant populations can further reduce the risk of reinfestation. This protocol is largely aimed for indoor houseplant owners and is not curated to eradicating mealybugs in outdoor/garden environments.\n\n*Note about soaps!*\n\nDawn and Dr. Bronner’s soaps are both effective against mealybugs but vary in impact on plant tissues due to differences in their chemical composition.\n\n* **Dawn Dish Soap**: The surfactants in Dawn, notably sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), are highly effective at breaking down oils and the waxy coating on mealybugs, leading to their dehydration and death. Research shows that soaps containing synthetic surfactants disrupt the cell membranes of soft-bodied insects like mealybugs, providing fast pest control on contact. However, high surfactant concentrations can damage sensitive plant tissues, causing leaf burn or discoloration if not sufficiently diluted. \n* **Castile Soap/Dr. Bronner’s Soap**: Dr. Bronner’s castile soap uses plant-derived oils, including coconut and olive oils, which are gentler on plants. Studies indicate that fatty acids in castile soaps can effectively disrupt insect exoskeletons without the harsher effects of synthetic surfactants, making them safer for repeated use on delicate plants. Though it might require multiple applications to control heavier infestations, Dr. Bronner’s is a preferred option for organic and sensitive plant care due to its lower risk of phytotoxicity​.\n\nIn summary, Dawn works quickly but may need dilution to protect sensitive plants, while Dr. Bronner’s is gentler but requires more frequent application to achieve comparable pest control.\n\n*Safety for Kids and Pets*\n\nBonide Systemic Insect Control is pet and people safe once dry.  Pets and people should be out of the area until it is dry to avoid contact ideally. absolutely avoid consumption of treated plants and soil. It’s not ideal to repeatedly expose the skin to it. but I repotted two dozen plants over the course of nine hours split across two days and never wore gloves and used the concentration for a heavy infestation and nothing happened to me. ingestion can cause stomach upset, but you have to eat quite a lot of the plant. the active ingredient is actually a prescribed medication for flea treatments for pets just at a lower a dose and obviously in a much different form than granules. It lasts about eight weeks or so in the soil and then the plant has absorbed all of the active ingredient. So you can always do the treatment once and not do it again if you don’t want to.\n\n*Author’s Notes about not having access to Bonide*\n\nHose the plant down, as soon as you notice the pests, if you are in a pinch. Getting rid of the adults living on the foliage is *way* better than nothing! Repot into fresh substrate and remove any that you see as you visually inspect daily after the initial hose down/mass removal. Be consistent w the alcohol sprays as often as your plant(s) can handle it. Consider using a larvicide in the soil to better manage any pests and have a sharper visual evaluation of the mealybug or other prolific pest situations. ",

In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

Olive oil is a chemical.\n\nAgain, falsely leading people to believe that their product is devoid of **gasp** big, bad, scary chemicals.\n\nAlso use male insecurities to sell the product, with a marketing message of \"the product you're using demasculates you - our product makes you more masculine.\"\n\nAnd that hipster piece of shit. His face is very punchable, and he is the perfect, stereotypical hipster.\n\nBest thing you can do? Click the link every single time the commercial comes up, mute it and let the whole advertisement play. Every time the ad pops up for you anywhere while browsing the internet, click it. The company pays Google for every click, every view, and pays more for retargeting views and clicks. Google charges more (often times 2-5 times more) to show ads to a \"highly engaged viewer\", and the company's advertising campaign data ends up being inaccurate, and therefore hurts their overall campaign performance.",

But it's usually a painful cycle of trying this anti-biotic then that anti-biotic. Then they'll try whatever prescription creams they can on you as if its just a laundry list. I know too many acne sufferers who wasted their money. *If you choose to go to a dermatologist or any other licensed skin specialist, make sure they are specifically specialized in acne.* \n\n2. **Quit dairy.** Get your calcium from non-dairy options or vitamins. Milk should be substitued with almond, NOT SOY, milk. Almond milk tends to have less sugar (and calories!) and soy has potential to make acne worse. Goat cheese is your best cheese option, or dairy-free cheese. Lactose-free dairy products could still be dairy products. \n\n3. **Regularly change your pillowcase.** This is a VERY important tip! It does make a difference!\n\n4. **Do NOT use face washes and shampoos with sodium lauryl sulfate/sodium laureth sulfate** ammonium lauryl sulfate is okay, I've never heard of anybody break out specifically from it. *Cetaphil face wash is an acne nightmare.* Don't use it! Avoid fragranced products as well. \n\n5. **Do not overeat eat anything with iodine** This includes certain supplements and seaweed. Iodine triggers acne. \n\n6. **Birth controls, particularly Yaz or Ortho-tri cyclen, can help** But some can harm, so ask an expert before using it. \n\n7. **Use benzoyl peroxide starting with no more than 2.5%, then if necessary upgrading to 5% after a while.** Never go over 5%. 10% can be used but only for spot treatment, and use a q-tip to treat. \n\n8. **Eat dark chocolate to stop sweet cravings, but avoid other sweets as much as possible.** I shoot for 80% dark. \n\n9. **Use powder face makeup.** Powders as foundation can give adequate coverage and are far less likely to cause breakouts. Liquids and creams are usually too heavy and can clog pores, even if labeled oil-free or non-comedonegenic. I recommend Almay face powder or even Bare Minerals which has good coverage. \n\n10. **You MUST wear sunscreen every day, even if it's cloudy or winter-time.** I recommend Elta sunscreens, they are lightweight and don't cause breakouts, I personally use them. Don't use a moisturizer if your skin is oily, a sunscreen can double as one.  Look for sunscreens with physical blocks, like zinc oxide. Invest in a good sunscreen so you don't spend hundreds on anti-aging products later. ",

I went on it before I lost my virginity b.c I had super irregular periods and pretty bad pms, including moderately bad acne.  IT WAS MAGICAL.  My skin cleared up in a month and my periods were light and regular with almost no bloating, cramps etc.  Then all of the sudden (3 years later) I started having these weird mood swings at night.  I would be totally fine all day and then just get really sad or angry or giddy or vacant or just plain old miserable.  every night.  So I went to the dr. they told me it was stress (totally wasn't my life was going amazingly well at the time).  It progressively got worse to the point that I was miserable or numb 24/7 with random interjections of hysteria, both crying and laughing, for no reason whatsoever and also completely, 100% lost my sex drive. didn't want to be touched.  every doctor i went to told me it was stress and i needed to do yoga or something.  I thought I was manic depressive and was freaking out.  This had been going on for two months.  till finally my thoroughly fed up bf at the time did a lot of research and told me it could be my pill.  went off it immediately and my mood elevated in a day.  It took almost 6 months for my mood to totally even out again and to get my sex drive back. \nMoral of the story? Yaz has way too much estrogen in it which over long periods of time will FUCK YOU UP.  Don't do it girls!\n\nTL;DR : Yaz was awesome till it made me go crazy.  Estrogen pills=bad news bears",

Cheap, safe, etc.  That's 95% of it.\n\nPossible additives:\n\nFor really embedded greasy stuff...ammonia.  It is a caustic substance which breaks down oils.  Safe, cheap.  Trisodium phosphate is also fine (now sold as deck cleaner...used to be in everything).\n\nFor sanitizing and dealing with colors of \"natural\" origin, oxidizers are usually best.  Oxiclean simply introduces some hydrogen peroxide.  That's fine.\n\nSpot treating with liquid pharmacy h202 is fine.\n\nBleach is also good for all around sanitizing.  Very small amounts too.  Teaspoon per gallon.  Nothing is rated as being able to disinfect or sterilize soft porous surfaces anyway, so don't worry about that.  \n\nThe other common way to sanitize is with ammonium chloride stuff, the Odobans and Lysols.  Different mechanism of microbe killing, and doesn't mess with colors, stains or otherwise; whether good or bad thats up to you.\n\nFor something weird like sharpie stains or waxy stuff, acetone or 90% alcohol plus suction.  \n\nFor a spot stain of unknown origin, LA's Totally Awesome from Dollar Tree is very versatile.  It has a bit of everything.  Soap, solvent, high PH.  Smell isn't great and is very sudsy, so use sparingly.  Fels-Naptha bar is substantially similar for mystery stains.\n\nFor significant shit, puke, milk, snot...might want a spot treater with the enzyme protease.\n\nMold?  You'll want an oxidizer again like bleach, hydrogen peroxide, or super fancy chlorine dioxide (strong and color safe).\n\nVinegar dissolves mineral deposits.  Possibly relevant to sweat stains.  Use in the rinse after other stuff...if at all.\n\nDont mix bleach with ammonia or vinegar plz.",

    "body": "Добрейший денёчек! Вот и снова я со своим добром. Буду писать сегодня о самом наболевшем. Сульфаты.\n\nСульфаты, как мы их привыкли собирательно называть- это соли серной кислоты, по сути своей, это достаточно агрессивные и дешманские вспенивающие компоненты, которые производители косметики пихают то тут, то там. Добавляют их в косметику, так как они удешевляют состав, образуют обильную пену, промывают «до скрипа», ну и уменьшают расход средства. Сейчас можно подумать что я просто описала «идеальный продукт», но как бы не так. \n\nСульфаты, а пока что я буду называть их так же собирательно, для удобства, они смывают все под чистую с кожи головы и волоса, а соответсвенно, вызывают привыкание кожи головы, так как из-за излишнего промывания сальные железы начинают работать ещё активнее, очень часто косметика с сульфатами вызывает аллергию, зуд, раздражения, ну и кучу ещё разных недугов. Именно по причине слишком усердного промывания их нельзя после процедуры кератинового выпрямления, ботокса или ламинирование волос. \n\nОбычно такие вспенивающие ПАВы стоят в первой половине состава в косметике, то есть достаточно много их там содержится, что не есть хорошо. Самы противные и нежелательные из них: SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate Лаурилсульфат натрия), SLES (sodium laureth sulfate лауретсульф натрия), а так же ALS и ALES вот эти ребятки прям максимально агрессивны, их вообще лучше стороной точно обходить, канцерогены, соединения аммония. \n\nКак же выбрать правильный шампунь? Смотрите в первую очередь на вспенивающие компоненты, мягкими, которые например используются в натур косметике, являются ПАВы на основе кокосового масла (узнать, как правило, можно по слову COCO в компоненте), на основе глюкозы (ищите слово: glucoside), изетеонаты (isethionate) и саркозинаты (sarcosinate), ну и мыльный орех, корень, кора мыльного дерева или сапиндуса (ищите sapindus или soapnut).\n\nОдни из самых вредных компонентов так же напишу сейчас, но поясню, там не все вспенивающие есть и кондиционирующие, для примера. \n\nCetrimonium и Etrimonium Chloride (кондиционеры Gliss KUR, как минимум, L’OREAL Paris, ежедневный спрей-кондиционер против ломкости), Lauramide DEA(lauric acid, вспениватель, в очищающей пенке Алоэ вера Nature republic), PEG-150 Distearate, ALS, ALES L’Oreal Elseve шампуни достаточно большая часть), SLS, SLES (очень часто встречаются в косметике, возьмите почти любой шампунь в супермаркете). Старалась найти конкретные примеры, но не всегда это осуществимо, так же хочу сказать стоит избегать TEA, MEA, DEA, они в бОльшей части являются канцерогенами, не все конечно, но большинство, ибо если это расписывать будет уже простыня и не очень понятно, сама уже запуталась. По поводу них стоит гуглить, так как их наименований действительно очень много, на сколько знаю не все из них вреднючие. \n\nХотелось бы сказать, что самого слова «sulfate» боятся не стоит, надо смотреть какой это именно компонент, он не обязательно будет являться агрессивным ПАВом, в общем, надо смотреть не на слово, а на компонент в целом. \n\nТак как агрессивные ПАВы вызывают привыкание кожи головы, то слезать с них достаточно трудно, голова начинает быстро жирниться и так далее, но оно того стоит, это нужно лишь немного перебороть себя)).\nТем более сейчас натур косметика сделала уже достаточно для того, чтобы мягкие ПАВы точно так же работали как сульфаты, то есть давали большую пену, хорошо промывали, так что особой разницы можно и не заметить даже, только это будет безопаснее, а так же не наносит вред окружающей среде. \n\nДумаю что написала вроде как все, стараясь особо не нагружать, буду ждать ваших отзывов предложений про что написать, замечаний. \nПост носит лишь рекомендательный характер и основан на опыте,  только личном. \nА ещё я хз про что в следующий раз написать)",

Минус анионных ПАВ в их условной \"неизбирательности\" и достаточно высокой способности растворять жиры. Кроме агрессивного обезжиривания они особо не опасны, если их конечно не принимать внутрь. \n\nНе стоит так категорично относиться к анионным ПАВ, разве что стоит избегать Sodium LAURYL sulfate, он достаточен агресивен.\n\nПАВ не так страшны как % их содержания в общей формуле, в шампуне может быть какой нибудь 0.5%, чисто для пены, это не страшно. \n\nЭто чисто мое имхо, но Лореаль лучше избегать как пожара, там 90% косметики что я видел, такое шлачище что это просто испанский стыд. \n\nВсе эти Натура сиберика, сиберика Натура и прочией \"натуральные марки на травках\", тот еще шлак, чисто маркетинговая уловка, и это не мое ИМХО, просто посмотрите на состав и качество таких шампуней.

    "body": "I have wasted sooo much money on hair products over the years!! I think that the demonization of sulfates has lead to reformulations that have been detrimental to my greasy mop.\n\nMy hair is pin straight, very silky, and fine. I have a lot of it, but it gets easily weighed down. It also gets easily tangled. My scalp is also EXTREMELY greasy! I would shampoo my hair twice a day if I could, I feel like daily isn't quite enough.\n\nSulfate-free shampoos give me dermatitis, and they actually give me headaches because they make my hair so tangled and weighed down that it tugs on my scalp. So I have been using shampoos with sulfates still, but my hair still has had that tangled/weighed down feel to varying degrees. And I felt trapped by conditioner, because I couldn't detangle my hair, but all conditioners weigh down my hair and make it greasy even faster, and don't detangle it very well to be honest. So I'd put conditioner on my hair first, to untangle my hair enough to reach my scalp, then shampoo it, then put a bit of conditioner on the ends to try and make it so I could detangle it, but I couldn't strike the balance between detanglable but greasy, or not using enough and trying to not rip my hair.\n\nMy hair has been increasingly flat, itchy, and gunky, and has only looked good (for a bit, but felt awful) when I blow dried it with many products for volume.\n\nSo I was using: a detangling serum, which weighed down my hair but helped it not be so matted, mousse, and then I would NEED to use dry shampoo after my hair was blow dried, because my scalp couldn't ever get completely clean.\n\nAnd I was using: Kerastase blond absolu shampoo and the conditioner, Bumble and bumble Sunday shampoo (which cleaned better than much else I'd tried, but not perfect, and left my hair a tangled mat), Amika purple conditioner. So I WAS using shampoo with sulfates! I will say, it's infuriating that seemingly every shampoo is sulfate free, or only has mild sulfates now, and every conditioner is VERY HEAVY! (I also used: Oribe, Aveda, Davines for conditioner. None of them would rinse out.)\n\nFinally, last week I had ENOUGH of spending hours on trying to make my hair look decent, and never feeling clean. I thought that since the products have sodium laureth sulfate, they should be cleaning well enough!\n\nI did research, and discovered that sodium lauryl sulfate is a stronger surfactant. So I made my way to the drugstore, with my only criteria being that the shampoo contained sodium LAURYL sulfate, and chose based on smell, which felt fun and lighthearted and not stressful. I chose Herbal Essences Body Envy shampoo, and the matching conditioner. \n\nThe first wash with the shampoo, which went easily into my hair without tangling it, removed so much of the weird gunk feeling from my hair. The second wash removed it ALL! My hair felt squeaky clean, but not tangled. I used the conditioner, which easily rinsed out. My hair easily brushed out after the shower, no other products needed!\n\nAnd...my hair has air dried, it feels so much lighter and better! I can't believe it. My hair was so weighed down. It is so shiny, and has so much more body, and isn't tangled in weird areas. I can't believe how easy and stressless it was.\n\nTL;DR: I love sodium lauryl sulfate.\n\nEDIT: I want to update by saying, I tried out my Kerastase mousse again, and it actually added body without making my hair feel disgusting!",

No matter how many times I shampooed my hair, my hair was still dirty. \n\nSo then I came across a post on Reddit about how someone had the same experience that I had to where they would use Sulfate-free shampoos, and it would not get their hair as clean as sulfates would so they went back to their sulfates and their hair has been thriving ever since. i decided to purchase a shampoo with sulfates in it after years of not using sulfates. i felt like i was going into the natural hair jail cell at the moment in time, it felt like a crime picking up a bottle that had  “Sodium Laureth Sulfate” in the ingredient list. I did my wash day routine and used the sulfates and i wash shocked.\n\n*when i tell you my hair hasn’t felt this clean in years, my scalp FINALLY felt like it was clean.*\n\nthat shampoo got every single buildup from my scalp it wasn’t even funny, it was truly liberating and one of the best shampoos my hair had in *years*. so I guess it’s safe to say that my hair needs the sulfates in order to be clean.\n\nI write this post to say that I believe that sulfates get a bad rep and sometimes i feel as if it’s some misinformation going around. of course, there are some naturals that don’t have a positive experience with sulfates in their shampoos because it dries out their hair and scalp, but for me, unfortunately sulfate free shampoos did not work out for me like I had hoped it too, and I stuck with it for years.\n\nbut it had me wondering, what if some naturals NEED sulfates in their hair and can’t get away with being sulfate-free?  for context, i have low porosity, very dense and thick, 4a hair that is super prone to buildup and an oily scalp so I believe that sulfates in this case are needed for me. but I truly feel like we cannot push this “sulfate-free” movement to everyone when everybody has different hair and scalp types. it’s not a one size fits all.",

The natural hair community often promotes sulfate-free shampoos as the gold standard, but the reality is that everyone’s hair and scalp have different needs. If you have low porosity, dense hair with an oily scalp, it makes perfect sense that you’d need a stronger cleanser to fully remove buildup. Sulfates aren’t inherently bad—they just need to be balanced with proper moisture to prevent dryness. At the end of the day, what matters most is listening to your hair and doing what actually works, rather than following trends that may not suit your unique texture and scalp condition.",

    "body": "[Archived topic here.](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/topic/144725-why-ph-is-important-skin-products-acids-etc/page-2) Relevant post copied below. \n----\nMore info on pH, compiled by tangal (former poster at the Diana Yvonne Skin Care Board) and edited by me *(LionQueen on acne.org)* (this is a work in progress, and I am still checking some facts. If you spot any problems, don't hesitate to PM me).\n\nThe initials pH stand for \"Power of Hydrogen\" or \"Potential of Hydrogen.\" Both terms are correct. This is a measure of the hydrogen ion content in a solution.\n\nThe pH scale measures how acidic or alkaline a product is, compared to pure distilled water (which is pH 7.0). Only wet substances have a measurable pH. The skin's pH is actually the pH on the skins surface from the moisture within the skin, and the \"acid mantle\" which is part of the protective \"barrier\" on its surface. Hair for example has no pH.\n\nThe acid mantle is a fine film layer, slightly acidic, made up from skin oils, sweat, and dead cells. It is one means the skin uses to protect itself from bacteria, moisture loss, and environmental damage. Pollutants, harmful bacterium, contaminants are normally alkaline in nature, so a slightly acid skin surface helps fight off these harmful elements and prevent them from entering into, and damaging the skin. Maintaining the acid mantle is recommended for good skin health. When the acid mantle is damaged it takes approximately 14-17 hours to repair itself (assuming no other damaging products are applied to it).\n\nA damaged acid mantle leads to a number of skin issues, such as over dry skin, dehydration, over oily skin, flaky skin, acne, sensitivity, etc. It would require another long post to detail all this. But incorrect pH products can contribute to acid mantle degradation, and increases in acne-causing bacteria on the skin. (More on this below)\n\n**The pH Scale**\n\nThe pH scale goes from 0-14. This covers most wet substances, and certainly all skincare products.\n\n-Acids have pH values under 7 - they are more acidic then water (acid)\n\n-Alkalis have pH values over 7 - they are more alkaline then water (base)\n\n-If a substance has a pH value of 7 - it is neutral, like water (neither acid nor base)\n\nThe difference between each whole-value pH level represents a tenfold change. (For example, a cleanser with a pH of 6 is ten times more alkaline than a cleanser with a pH of 5, and a cleanser with a pH of 7 is 100 times more alkaline then one of 5.) Because of this, only a few units of pH can make a big difference in how your skin reacts to a product.\n\n**Some pH examples:**\n\npH 1 = Battery acid\n\npH 1.5 -2 = gastric (stomach) acid\n\npH 2 = lemon juice\n\npH 2.5 = cola soft drinks\n\npH 3 = vinegar\n\nph 3.5 = orange juice\n\npH 4.6-5.5 = healthy skin (and recommended pH range for your cleanser, for best skin health)\n\npH 5.5 = rainwater (pure water, when exposed to the atmosphere, will take in carbon dioxide, changing its pH)\n\npH 6.5 = milk\n\npH 6.5 - 7.4 = healthy saliva\n\npH 7 = pure distilled water - (This is neutral pH, neither acid nor base)\n\npH 7.35 - 7.45 = human blood\n\npH 8.5 = baking soda (damaging to skin's acid mantle)\n\npH 9 = seawater\n\npH 9.0-10.0 = hand soap, detergents (very damaging to acid mantle)\n\npH 10.5 = Milk of Magnesia\n\npH 11.5 = household ammonia\n\npH 12.5 = household bleach\n\npH 13 = lye (sodium hydroxide, or Draino)(Alkaline or Base extreme)\n\n**Skin and the Acid Mantle**\n\nNewborn baby skin has a neutral pH of 7. Within a few months it adjusts to a more \"normal\" pH of 4.5 to 5.5, enabling it to be more resistant to bacteria.\n\nAdult skin is normally slightly acidic, a range of 4.5 to 5.5. Different body areas can differ in pH, and disease and acid mantle damage can alter pH. But the preferred range for facial skin pH is 4.5 to 5.5.\n\nThose with skin disease, skin problems, and stressed skin usually have a skin pH over 6.0. Aged, stressed and damaged skin have more difficulty maintaining a \"correct\" pH.\n\nAs skin pH is elevated closer to pH 7.0, it becomes less and less able to function optimally and to kill bacteria. This allows acne-causing bacteria to multiply rapidly on the skin's surface. (Acne bacteria are found on everyone's skin, even if you never have a pimple in your life.) The damaged skin is unable to fend off the excess bacteria, and they multiply rapidly. Bacteria growth is very slow at pH of 5.5 or less, but a slight shift upward, toward the alkaline levels, causes a marked increase in the reproduction and lifespan of acne-causing bacteria.\n\nSo if your skin is at a higher pH (anything over 6, as damaged skin often is) the acne-causing bacteria can multiply much easier and faster -- often faster then your skin can handle. Skin pH is one main contributor to acne.\n\nSkin pH also has an effect on how easily irritated your skin is, how well it ages, and how it deals with product and environmental stress. This is why it is recommended that you cleanse skin with mild, non-irritating products, as close to the skin's natural pH as possible.\n\nMany commercial cleansers are highly alkaline, which also changes the skin's pH to alkaline levels on the skin surface, for a short time. Many alkaline cleansers are in the same pH range as baking soda, and some are nearly as high as ammonia. This is very harsh on the skin, and can lead to increased irritation, acne, moisture loss, skin aging etc. As pimples erupt, the skin is less able to heal itself, or the damage that pimples leave behind. \n\nIf a product has a high pH and a considerable percentage of a strong detergent such as sodium lauryl sulfate, or irritant like peppermint oil or menthol, because of the pH destructive activity on the acid mantle, the detergent can contribute to even more damage then it would if the product pH was closer to 5.5. It literally takes a split second for an alkaline product to degrade the skin barrier enough for an irritant or damaging detergent to penetrate. Some people can handle this better then others, but long term daily use on the skin can contribute to long term issues on all skin types. As skin ages, or the barrier function degrades, it has more difficultly dealing with this type of stress.\n\nEven when the skin re-adjusts to its more normal pH (4.5 to 5.5) - it is already damaged, irritated and stressed. The damage recovery involves longer term healing; 14 to 17 days for acid mantle repair. Continued long-term damage, stress, and mild irritation can prevent the skin from maintaining its best pH level of 4.5 to 5.5. With time, and increased damage, it may tend to stay at the 6 range or higher.\n\nAs skin become healthier, its pH values lower, and acne growth also lowers. The skin becomes more \"normal\" and regulated.\n\n**Listing of pH of many common cleansers:**\n\n[http://www.dianayvonne...](http://www.dianayvonne.com/content/pHcleansers.pdf)\n\nA few examples from above link:\n\nBurt's Bees Tomato, Carrot, and Lettuce soaps 10\n\nDial Soap (liquid and bar) 9.5\n\nDove Bar, Baby Dove Bar 7\n\nJohnson & Johnson Head to Toe Baby Wash 6.5-7.0\n\nNeutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar Original Formula 8.7-9.2\n\nPaula's Choice (all formulations) 5.5\n\nA product may include the term \"pH Balanced\" on the label. This does NOT mean that it has an optimal pH of 5.5. The term has no legal definition.\n\nSome products are a good pH, but high in irritants. Which is better than high pH and high irritants, but not great either.\n\nA good cleanser cleans the skin without breaking down the acid mantle, or adding irritants to the skin. It is mild with a 5.5 or lower pH.\n\n**Exfoliating Power of AHAs and BHAs**\n\nThe acids commonly used in skin care treatment (AHAs, BHAs,TCA) are all pH dependent. The lower the pH, the more effective the acid is on the skin. It will work better, penetrate better and deeper, with a more concentrated effect. It can also be more irritating, because it is more \"powerful.\"\n\nWhen an acid product is formulated with a pH below 2.0, all of its acid percentage is essentially \"free\" or available to work effectively on the skin.\n\nFor example:\n\nA 20% lactic acid product at a pH of 1.9 has 20% of the lactic acid \"free\" or available to work on your skin. This is referred to as the \"Free Acid Value\" or FAV.\n\nAs pH is raised closer to 7.0, less acid is free and the acid's effectiveness is weakened. So for a true understanding of the strength of your acid product, you need to know the acid percentage in the product, AND the pH.\n\nAHAs (glycolic, lactic, mandelic, malic, citric, tartaric, etc.) are basically ineffective over 4.0 pH. **To exfoliate the surface of the skin, the pH must be below 4.0. and the product percentage must be over 5%.** 5% to 8% with a pH of 3.0 - 4.0 is the MINIMUM level for a daily use AHA; this will not treat scars or rebuild collagen. \n\nBHAs (salicylic acid) are also basically ineffective over 4.0 pH. **To exfoliate the skin, and unclog pores, the pH must be below 4.0 and the product percentage must be over 1%.** (1% to 2% with a pH of 3.0 - 4.0 is the MINIMUM level for a daily use BHA. Skin with very clogged pores may need a higher concentration, up to 5%, and lower pH.\n\nA pH test strip or litmus strip will give you the pH. (buy some made with a lower pH range, not all strips go from 1 - 14) Strips will not be as accurate as a true electronic pH gage, but for home use it will be close enough.\n\nHere is the link to Diana Yvonne's page on FAV and skin remodeling results:\n\n[http://dianayvonne.z...y/16.aboutpeels](http://dianayvonne.zoovy.com/category/16.aboutpeels)\n\nThis shows two charts.\n\nThe first chart covers the FAV available, and the amount of acid percent needed for specific skin effects (exfoliation, collagen rebuilding, skin lightening, etc.).\n\nFor example: a 10% (free acid value) glycolic acid (AHA) gives \"Significant increase in squamous cell turnover.\nModerate increase in collagen deposition.\" In other words, 10% concentration of AHA acid working on the skin is enough to remove damaged cells, and rebuild skin collagen or firmness.\n\nThe second chart clarifies how the pH affects the amount of acid available for the skin to use (FAV). \n\nFor example, the three 20% entries:\n\n20% AHA at a pH of 2.55 has a free acid value (FAV) of 18.6%. (It's only REALLY an 18.6% product in effectiveness, because of the pH over 2.0.)\n\n20% at pH 3.4 drops to 14.6% FAV.\n\n20% at pH 4.3 drops to 4.8% FAV.\n\nWhen a 20% AHA product has a pH over 3 it has lost approximately 25% of its exfoliation activity. Once pH reaches 4.0, it loses 75% of its exfoliation activity. This is why so many commercial products are ineffective!\n\nBHAs are effective at slightly different ranges, so the FAV scale differs a bit, but the principle is similar.\n\nSkin Biology Exfol serum (2% BHA with a 3.2 pH) and Paula's Choice 2% BHA (3.4 pH) are very similar products, and strengths. Professional Solutions 2% BHA has a pH of 1.9% so is actually much more active on the skin then either Exfol or Paula's Choice, even at the same acid percentage.\n\n\n**Layering Products and Wait Times**\n\npH affects the acid you use and how it works. Another consideration is not to disturb an acid while it is on your skin, which can alter pH and affect its action on the skin.\n\nGenerally speaking an acid is effective for approximately 20 to 30 minutes on the skin surface. After that point the skin pH has risen enough to lessen the exfoliation action on the skin, and the acid is effectively neutralized. During this 30 minute time frame, the acid is working at effective levels. Anything applied after 30 minutes will not hamper the effect of your acid, as the pH has already changed, and the acid action has slowed a lot.\n\nAcids that are a high (peel) percentage such as 30% and 40% and above are more concentrated. Therefore their activity can continue for longer, so their action should be stopped at appropriate time with the use of a base rinse (baking soda and water) or a mild detergent cleanser. This will effectively halt the exfoliation action, by raising the skin pH.\n\nWashing the skin with an cleanser of pH over 5.5 can slow or lessen the effect of your acid, because the acid must now deal with the high pH level on the skin. The bigger the range difference, the more this will affect your acid action, especially in the case of acids at 2.0 pH or less. So if you use a high pH cleanser, you should wait 30 minutes before using a pH-dependent product, to allow the skin to regulate its pH down to about 5.5. Or you can use an acidic toner to adjust the pH of the skin down before applying the product.\n\nMost commercial astringents and toners contain high levels of irritants such as alcohols, Witch Hazel, Menthols, Mint oils, etc. These should be avoided, as they can damage the skin barrier. If you want to use a toner to adjust pH to lower levels, either use a liquid acid like Paula's Choice BHA or AHA liquid first, or a very dilute mixture of Apple Cider Vinegar and distilled water. Vivant's Mandelic Acid toner is another good option, though it is expensive. \n\nThe best option is simply to use a cleanser with a pH of 5.5.\n\nIf you use a BHA product with 3.2 pH, then immediately apply a treatment product on top with 6.5 pH, the exfoliation action of your BHA is reduced by 75%. So applying a higher pH to your pH dependent acid will neutralize it sooner, or stop its action at the point you added the higher pH product.\n\nOther products are also pH dependent. L-Ascorbic Acid forms of Vitamin C are pH dependent. For good stability and effective action, a good Ascorbic acid product is about 2.0 pH. Since Vitamin C absorbs faster into the skin, you can generally have a shorter wait of about 10 to 15 minutes. \n\n**Some Good General Rules**\n\n(This info comes from DebbieNIR, former host of the Diana Yvonne Skin Care Board. The original post is now gone.)\n\n1. Use a mild, non-irritating, detergent-free cleanser with a 5.5 pH or lower.\n\n2. If your cleanser pH is higher then 5.5, wait 15 to 30 minutes after cleansing to use a low pH AHA or BHA. (Or use a toner to acidify the skin first.)\n\n3. Acids should be applied to freshly cleansed skin.\n\n4. Both acid percentage and product pH must be used to factor total effective acid amounts. (FAV)\n\n5. If using AHA and BHA together, always apply AHA first (after cleansing)  UNLESS the BHA solution pH is equal to or lower than your AHA. In this case, apply the BHA first, because it penetrates skin oils better, and will enhance the AHA effectiveness.\n\n6. Acids can be used in many different ways - which affect wait times.\n\na) If a 2% or 5% BHA product is used, and rinsed off, WAIT until it is rinsed off to proceed with other products. (BHA washes are less effective than leave-on products.)\n\nb) If a 2% or 5% BHA product is applied and left on the skin, but no AHA product is following, **wait 30 minutes before applying next product.** This allows the BHA to work at its most effective, and exfoliate at optimal levels. \n\nc) If a 2% or 5% BHA is applied and left on the skin before a rinse-off AHA, you do not need to wait to apply the AHA â€“ IF the pH of both products is similar and compatible. If you rinse the AHA off after 5 minutes of application (over the BHA) you have also stopped the BHA action at 5 minutes. Both should have a lower effective pH. If the AHA has a higher pH, it will also raise the pH of the BHA, affecting its action also.\n\nd) If a 2% or 5% BHA is being left on the skin, before a leave on AHA, you don't need to wait to apply the AHA. Apply BHA, then AHA, then wait a total of 30 minutes with both products layered, then proceed to next product application. (This is assuming that both acids have a low pH.)\n\ne) **Do not apply a higher pH BHA before a lower pH AHA.** The higher pH product will hinder the lower pH product. Wait 30 minutes between both acids, applying the lowest pH first. \n\nf) If using a higher BHA after a lower AHA product, apply lower pH AHA first. Wait 30 minutes for it to work. Then apply higher pH BHA on top, and wait 30 minutes for the BHA to work. Then apply other products on top.\n\ng) If you need to rinse products off sooner then 30 minutes to shorten activity and lessen irritation, you can rinse with water, before proceeding to the next step. If using a high strength AHA or BHA, at strong \"professional\" peel level strength, you will neutralize product with baking soda and water, and rinse off before proceeding to your next step.\n\nh) Apply low pH before high pH.\n\n\n**Layering Other Products**\n\nThis information is also from DebbieNIR's posts on the Diana Yvonne Skin Care Board.\n\nRetinols, Retinoids, Vitamin A products\nThese products are often pH dependent. Apply to clean dry skin, once to twice a day. Wait at least 15 to 30 minutes before adding other active products. In the case of retinols, retinyls, and retinals, wait at least 30 and preferably 45 minutes to allow the active ingredient to convert to retinoic acid within your skin.\n\nDCX:\nThis is an eye treatment product with soy. It is not an exfoliate. Should be applied to clean skin, once or twice a day. Apply after acids and cleansers, before copper and other treatments. Wait 10 minutes to allow it to absorb. Then apply other products.\n\nDMAE:\nCan be used after acids and cleansing. Formulation type can dictate placement. Liquids, gels and serums can be applied before CP serums, lotions and creams. Lotion and cream DMAE should be applied after CP serums and creams. Wait 10 minutes to allow product to absorb.\n\n\n**Product Application by Type**\n\nThis is a rough guide for product application, based on type/absorbency. This is for products that are not pH dependent, nor limited by activity type. The thickness of a product, dictates its placement. You cannot apply a thin product (like a liquid) over a thick product (like a cream) and expect it to absorb well. The cream can be a barrier to the thinner product.\n\n-Cleanser\n\n-Toner (pH-adjusting product in a liquid, watery form)\n\n-Exfoliant (AHA or BHA, usually requires a wait time)\n\n-Serum (Copper Serum, treatment Serums, DMAE thicker products)\n\n-Gel (DMAE, Green Cream, Differin)\n\n-Oils (Emu, Jojoba, Almond, etc)\n\n-Creams\n\n-Sunscreen\n\n-Foundations ",

    "body": "Tl;dr: I'm concerned that my fancy new hairdresser is a waste of time and money. \n\nLast summer, I bleached my naturally dark brown hair yellow and then dyed it ginger. \n\nThen dyed it pink. \n\nThen dyed it red. \n\nThen dyed it black. \n\nAs a result of all that, I had to reduce the length of it from bra wire to shoulder - a necessary evil but my goal is now to leave it to grow out naturally and get my nice long natural hair back. Even longer, preferably. \n\nI found a hairdresser in my city who specialises in long hair. His entire schtick is long hair: growing it, maintaining it, etc. He was trained by this late great world renowned long hair specialist called George Michael. It all sounded perfect.\n\nThe cut was fine, but he said something that made me sceptical: \n\n*Hair should all be one length with no shorter fringe or layers because otherwise it 'focuses' on trying to even out the different lengths.* \n\nIs this true? It sounds like nonsense to me. \n\nThe second thing that made me doubtful was the shampoo he recommended I use contains sodium laureth sulfate. \n\nI shelled out for this three step set of products (George Michael brand) that he insists on his clients using. It wasn't cheap at around £70 for the set, so I expected them to be full of good things and stupidly didn't bother checking what was in them until a few weeks later when I noticed my hair was feeling dry - in my defence, his website claimed the shampoo was 'free of detergents' so I assumed there wouldn't be any SLS! \n\nThe ingredients are as follows:\n\n*Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, PEG 80 Sorbitan Laurate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Disodium Lauroampodiacetate, PEG 150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Citric Acid, Gylcol Stearate (and other ingredients), Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, Mathylparaben, Propylene Glycol, Color (FD&C Red#33 & D&C Orange #4) and Fragrance*\n\nI thought SLS was meant to be a big no no for maintaining healthy hair, especially if it's wavy which mine is. \n\nAs for the rest of the ingredients, I have no idea whether they're bad or good. Sodium trideceth sulfate sounds like it could be similarly drying but I wouldn't know. \n\nThis whole thing has left me doubtful of his advice. I'm meant to be going back to see him at the end of the month but I currently feel like he's taking me for a ride with these expensive products. He has loads of good testimonials so I feel stupid for doubting him. What do you guys think? \n\n(P.S. Sorry for the essay!)",

Also only apply shampoo on the roots and nowhere else.\n\n>Hair should all be one length with no shorter fringe or layers because otherwise it 'focuses' on trying to even out the different lengths.\n\nSince its harder to always cut layered hair equally much I'd say thats decent advise. It's easier to maintain healthy hair when it's all one length as you can easily always cut a tiny bit off the ends  meanwhile with layers it's hard to get every piece. Also long hair will thin out at the ends by default so no reason to make it worse with layers. Weird wording though.\n\n\nOverall I believe fancy hairdressers are a waste of money and so is a lot of the fancy hair products. You can literally use any shampoo and it will be alright, the only actual difference is conditioners as professional ones (which you can buy for cheap on amazon) are higher concentrated. Hairdressers will always charge you extra for products and will try to sell a certain line of products. Personally I'd recommend to just buy L'Oréal professionals or redken from amazon, you can get a saloon grade shampoo and conditioner for $30 and it will legit last for ages.\nOtherwise, if you want to grow your hair long, ANY hairdresser can cut your ends from time to time, and that's all you need.\nNo hair product can change the speed at which hair grows, or how well it does, the only thing you can do is use lots of conditioner and get regular trims to keep the ends healthy and with no breakage.

It is so very rigid in the ideals, which just match the founders personal ideals for women's hair.\n\nI think the George Michael affiliated salons or stylists are loved because they will generally not over-trim hair beyond the minimum and time is meant to be spent on snipping off individual splits throughout the hair. They are also gentle in their drying technique etc to accommodate extreme length. \n\nHowever, I think the one size fits all approach massively lets them down.

        "body": "So, here's my 2 cents.\n\nWe cannot really tell you what the hairdresser meant because for one since you did not fully understand what he told you, it could be that it was paraphrased wrong to begin with. Secondly you need to ask him to explain. It is important to build a relationship with your hairdresser/stylist, where you can feel comfortable to ask him questions about your hair or what he is teaching you. \n\nSLS is not necessarily bad, it is bad to people who have an allergy or irritation. It is one of the ingredients that can really cleanse the hair. Some SLS free products are not effective cleansers or may dry the hair more than an SLS shampoo does. The whole composition of the shampoo is important as there are ingredients that in low dosages can do tremendous work. So using SLS is not a no-no to maintain healthy hair, this is something some people came up with because a lot of SLS shampoos happen to be drying, or they are using the wrong one for their hair.\n\nThe shampoo you shared has nothing special to cost $70 though. Since this stylist seems to have this own routine or methods to grow hair, it could be the reason why he pushes this technique. After all, if you do not use what he suggests he might not be able to get the results he wants or expects for your hair. Know that whenever you go to a branded store, like Paul Mitchelle Salon, Wella Salon, Deva Curl salon etc...all these type of salons have their products and will most likely suggest you products in their product line. It is easier to not get that only if you go to a salon that isn't affiliated with a single hair care brand.",

In addition it sounds like you put your hair through a absolute torture series with the chemicals so it might still be thinner on the ends. If your density on the ends isn't as thick as it should be keeping it all one length would infact help it look longer and fuller. However.... the shampoo and conditioner ect. making your hair feel dry should not happen. SLS is not the devil depending on what other ingredients are involved however it is a cheaper and harsher surfactant. If your hair is not reacting well to the product and considering the ingredients, it is probably not the correct products for you. If you haven't used much of it I would see if the salon has a return or exchange policy for products ( some salons do considering amount of usage). Kevin Murphy or Davines or Aveda are amazing wonderful brands that I've seen envoke wonderful improvements to hair, you might check some of those brands out. It seems like this hairdresser has gotten sucked into a product/ brand culture which I've seen happen a lot in the industry ( kinda cult like ). I doubt the stylist is purposely trying to divert you from your goal, but you should find someone who makes you feel comfortable, understood and informed. ( sorry for the novel ) *hairdresser*",

It can be a good thing to use every once in a while to remove product and hard water buildup, especially if you use products with silicones. I use a SLS-free chelating shampoo to remove hard water buildup. I think the best thing you can do to grow your hair long is reduce physical stress on your hair from styling and to get to know ingredients. It takes time and some scientific literacy definitely helps but in the end, it’s worth it. Finding the right balance of moisture and protein in products will help to keep your hair manageable while it grows.\n\nI use to obsess about keeping my hair long and wanted to only use “natural products.” I have fine, porous, low density hair that’s a mix of 2a - 2c textures. I used apple cider vinegar and baking soda to wash for almost 10 years, brushed with a boar bristle brush and applied straight jojoba to the ends daily. It was a mess and didn’t grow at all due to the breakage that I had no idea I was causing. Now I use a variety of products based off their ingredients and my hair is the healthiest it’s ever been. It grows at least 1/2” a month which is pretty common. Different things work for everyone so I’m not gonna say that you should or shouldn’t use specific products based off my own experience but learning ingredients will help you avoid wasting time and money.\n\nThe only universal hair truth I believe in is don’t buy hair care products from Amazon and Ebay. There’s just too much counterfeit product out there and their quality control is nonexistent.",

        "body": "My understanding is that at lower concentrations it's used as an emulsifier or a solvent, not a surfactant. Above 2% is when skin irritation occurs:\n\n>Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), also known as sodium laurilsulfate or sodium dodecyl sulfate, is an anionic surfactant commonly used as an emulsifying cleaning agent in household cleaning products (laundry detergents, spray cleaners, and dishwasher detergents). The concentration of SLS found in consumer products varies by product and manufacturer but typically ranges from 0.01% to 50% in cosmetic products[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#b1-ehi-9-2015-027),[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#b2-ehi-9-2015-027) and 1% to 30% in cleaning products.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#b3-ehi-9-2015-027),[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#b4-ehi-9-2015-027)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dermal toxicity studies demonstrate that 24-hour exposure to a 1–2% (w/w) solution of SLS can increase the transepidermal water loss of the stratum corneum – the outer most layer of the skin – and cause mild yet reversible skin inflammation.24,25 Human patch tests (typically a 24-hour exposure) confirm that SLS concentrations >2% are considered irritating to normal skin.2,26,27 Dermal irritation also tends to increase with SLS concentration and the duration of direct contact.2 In reality, dermal exposure to SLS in cleaning products is more likely to last a matter of minutes rather than hours.9\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#:\\~:text=The%20concentration%20of%20SLS%20found,to%2030%25%20in%20cleaning%20products.&text=SLS%20can%20be%20synthetic%20or%20naturally%20derived](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#:~:text=The%20concentration%20of%20SLS%20found,to%2030%25%20in%20cleaning%20products.&text=SLS%20can%20be%20synthetic%20or%20naturally%20derived).\n\nSo I assume the concentration is less than 2% so maybe they get away with \"not a sulfate\" in the sense of it not being at the levels of a skin irritant. I am allergic to sulfates but could still use Cetaphil, which also contains SLS in low concentrations and was told it was used as an emulsifier. It does seem like a weird advertising loophole though...\n\nEdit: I just saw you said SLES, I'll look it up now but it might be the same idea as they're so similar?",

I remember being told to brush my teeth maybe 3 times. I knew brushing was important but I didn't care because it caused me so much distress. Fast forward to now, I'm 29 and struggle with basic hygiene. I decided after reading some posts here that I really needed to step up my game and I've been making conscious efforts to brush my teeth. \n\nI am a week into brushing, flossing and tongue scraping daily and I started noticing that I particularly hated when it came down to brushing the tongue. The second that toothpaste hits my tongue my eyes start to water and I do a frantic scrub and then spit as soon as possible because it feels like I've just eaten some hot chilli it burns that bad. Today I was inspecting my tongue and noticed some red spots so I decided to do a little research and discovered there is something in a majority of toothpaste called SLS. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. This is what gives toothpaste it's bubbles. Turns out it's actually incredibly bad for those of us with a sensitive mouth.\n\nSo, I looked at the ingredient list on my toothpaste, and sure enough, there it was. I bought a new toothpaste today with Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate instead and brushed my teeth and guess what? No burning. No struggle. I was prepared for pain, and it never came.\n\nNo pain while brushing will certainly encourage me to brush more often and I am just so excited to have figured out why I hated it so much.\n\nHope this helps someone else here who struggles!",

    "body": "There has been a post about Scrubee clogging drains. Since other products like Buffy or Coco Loco are causing the same issues, some people were complaining why Lush doesn't change the formula. I want to emphathize that I totally get everyone's dissapointment. I also think that Lush's customer service response some people got is not optimal. But I will try to explain why clogging happens and why changing the formulas of the products isn't as easy as it seems:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe clogged drain ist just because of the Scrubee & Co. ingredients. If you look at Scrubee, it is a pretty natural product. Excpet fragrance, it doesn't contain any synthetic ingredients. The main ingredients are Shea and Cocoa butter. That's what leaves the nourished feeling on the skin. As you know, oils don't dissovle in water, they just melt by the heat and get carried away. That's what's causing the clogging. The oil is floating in hot water, passing through cold metal drains, therefore sticking to the cold metal. To resolve this issue, one would need to add an emulsifier. That's a substance that makes oil and water connect. These can be ingredients such as Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearic Acid or Glyrecyl Stearate. As you can probably guess, these are synthetic ingredients. . Compare Scrubee and the naked body conditioners: They both have Shea and Cocoa butter as their main ingredients. Scrubee is very butter and rich and creates an oily film, while the solid body conditioners create a white, creamy liquid. That's because the body conditioners contain synthetic emulsifiers that help to dissolve the product in water. Adding emulsifiers would fundamentally change Scrubee, Buffy & Co. They would make the products less natural. They would also change the consistency and effect of the products.\n\nSo the fact that they can clog narrow drains like the one's many people in North america have is unfortunately in the \"nature\" of these products. What would be an awesome solution if Lush would make a solid scrub with a base similar to the body conditioners but exfoliants like almond, rice or coconut shells.",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml. Max discount 30%.\n\nUsage Timeline: 2 months\n\nConsistency: It's a pink liquid. Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far. I'm done with half the tub and I'm not looking forward to hunting a moisturising coditioner without protein once again.\n\nBottomline:  💔\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Plum Olive and Macadamia Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Brassica Campestris/​Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/brassica-campestris-aleurites-fordi-oil-copolymer), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetostearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrogenated-ethylhexyl-olivate), [Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrogenated-olive-oil-unsaponifiables), [Hydrolyzed Corn Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-corn-protein), [Hydrolyzed Soy Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-soy-protein), [Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Macadamia Integrifolia (Macadamia) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/macadamia-integrifolia-seed-oil), [Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenyl-hydroxypropyl-steardimonium-chloride), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [P-Methoxycinnamidopropyl Dimethyl Behenyl Ammonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/p-methoxycinnamidopropyl-dimethyl-behenyl-ammonium-chloride), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nPrice: MRP 675 for 250 ml. Plum has a 100 million sales throughout. You can get it for around 450ish.\n\nUsage Timeline: No clue. I'm on my third tub.\n\nConsistency: Thick white cream\n\nUsage: This works both ways. Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "Hey y’all. I was reading this 2020 article called “[Are Beauty Brands Intentionally Hiding Their Ingredients?](https://jessicadefino.substack.com/p/are-beauty-brands-intentionally-hiding-their-ingredients-694b38f0f11d?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true)” by Jessica Defino, and she lists some examples of beauty brands who have hidden their ingredients online in the past or still today.\n\nI have also noticed this happen in the “Clean Beauty” space. I find this to be very sketchy and will not support brands who engage in these practices personally. Here are some examples from the article\n\n* **La Prarie:** *“In my opinion, brands who do not display their ingredients are most definitely doing this intentionally”… Sometimes, it’s to protect profits. “If you’re going to spend $300 on a single product, you are more likely to read all the information provided because it’s not an impulse buy,” Parr explains. If said product includes, say, possibly-carcinogenic butylated hydroxytoluene and potentially-hormone-disrupting parabens (as is the case with* [*La Prairie Skin Caviar*](https://www.laprairie.com/default/gift-guide-2019/luxe-cream/95790-01251-94.html?ncr=true&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6Lm-ue_t5QIVA6SzCh11QAO1EAQYASABEgIoNfD_BwE)*, $510, the ingredients of which are not available on La Prairie’s site), consumers may be quicker to ask questions and slower to spend money.*\n* **Beauty Blender:** *“The brand has chosen not to disclose the contents of its* [*Bounce Foundation*](https://beautyblender.com/collections/foundation/products/bounce-1-40-n) *on its site, save to say they’re made with “all of the good” and “none of the bad.” This gives the impression that the products are very nice and safe. In reality, Beautyblender formulates with talc (*[*asbestos*](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/talc) *contamination is a concern, leading many cosmetics corporations to “*[*quietly move away from*](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/beauty-brands-moving-talc-cancer-lawsuits-mount-200609194041998.html)*” formulating with the ingredient), PEGs (created through ethoxylation, a method that uses ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen, and can result in contamination from 1,4 dioxane, another known carcinogen), and fragrance”* (update: BB appears to now be listing the ingredients for this foundation!) \n\nI also noticed that this sub’s [recent villain](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/1f6whjk/comment/ll3bor8/), **Sahi Cosmetics**, touts a “[Clean Beauty Promise](https://sahicosmetics.com/pages/clean-beauty-promise)” with ingredients that will “NEVER” be in their products. A redditor commented a couple weeks ago that  lots of the products on the Sahi Cosmetics site don’t have ingredients listed, so I used the wayback machine and found that the ingredients *used* to be listed. Many contain ingredients that they say they \"NEVER\" use, which makes me suspect that the ingredients might have been hidden for this reason? Some examples:\n\n* **Carbon Black** appears present in the 'Snatched and Glowing' Eye & Face Kit -- the Precise FeltTip Liner specifically \n* **Aluminum Salts** appear to be present in the Under Eye Creamy Concealer (Aluminum Hydroxide  is an emulsifier and pH adjuster, and can fall into the aluminum salts category. Additionally, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate falls under aluminum salts)\n* **Aluminum Salts** also appear to be present in some of the baked blushes ( Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, and Calcium Sodium Borosilicate all contain aluminum compounds)\n* **SLES** (Sodium Laureth Sulfate) and **Mineral Oil** are present in the Waterproof Mascara (Paraffin is a type of mineral oil; plus Microcrystalline Wax (Cera Microcristallina)).\n* Many of these products contain **Phenoxyethanol** (okay if it’s less than 1%, but the concentration is not listed) and **Titanium Dioxide**, which if in neoparticle form would also be a violation of the clean beauty initiative (but it’s unclear what form it is in). \n* **Talc:** it’s also worth noting that the Baked Blushes, which do not have ingredients currently listed on the website, also contain Talc. I think most of us are aware of the risk of Talc contamination (even if small) when it comes to private labeled goods, and this is an ingredient that many consumers will want to know is in the products or not. \n\nDoes anyone have other examples to share that I can add to my list of brands who appear to have hidden their full ingredients from consumers, or brands claiming to be “Clean” but still using ingredients that are no-nos? Please share if so",

Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

My hair definitely felt smooth and conditioned(a bit on the heavier side), but it was no better than the results I’ve gotten with my loreal dream lengths conditioner. This is just an interesting anecdote, but the people that I HAVE seen rave about this intensive repair conditioner are usually people with chemical damage from bleaching. I have never bleached my hair in my life. I would say my biggest concern is maybe mechanical and heat damage on virgin hair. That’s pretty much it. You’re likely seeing good results with it because it has good conditioning ingredients and the formula that your hair likes.",

    "body": "It’s been several weeks since I picked up a pot of Tofu to try, and I wanted to share my thoughts. To preface, I have 2b/2c textured hair that tends to be pretty dry and thirsty. I live in a cold climate and typically seek skincare and hair care products that offer extra moisture. \n\nI was particularly interested in Tofu because it does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). I use Wasabi Shan Kui and Avocado Co-Wash from Lush as well, but I find at times they can be a little too harsh and stripping for me. Tofu is my go-to regular shampoo, and I’ll use one of the others every 3-4 washes to clarify my hair. \n\nI feel very neutral about the scent of Tofu. I pick up on the fennel pretty strongly, so to me it smells like a slightly sweet, herbal, licorice-like scent. In my opinion it’s pretty delicate, and it doesn’t stick around. I don’t feel like my hair smells like Tofu later in the day, which I don’t mind at all. I’m a rather new Lushie, so I’m not aware if any other products share the same scent family as Tofu! \n\nMy overall review is that Tofu is one of the stronger shampoo contenders at Lush, especially for dry textured hair. It lathers beautifully, is SLS free, adds extra moisture, and still does a great job getting my hair clean. I’m also just a huge fan in general of the cream formula hair care at Lush, like Tofu, Power, and Glory. If you’ve been thinking about giving formulas like this a try, I would highly recommend picking out a sample to take home from your local store if you’re able! \n\nI will be investing in a bigger size pot next time. Have you tried Tofu yet? What do you think?",

    "body": "**Skin Type:** dry, sensitive, easily dehydrated; not acne-prone\n\n**Climate:** Dry, Northern California weather\n\n**Ingredients that I found out I’m allergic/sensitive to:** lanolin, nickel, triethanolamine, methylisothiazolinone, chemical sunscreen, macadamia nut oil, and snail ☹ (I can’t believe how sensitive my skin is, considering I don’t even have pollen/food allergies that I know of).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI ventured into AB last year due to my very dry and dehydrated face. I’ve always had dry skin but when I moved from SoCal to NorCal last year, my face became more dry, itchy, and flaky especially when the weather got colder. I loved the sun in SoCal and never used sunscreen on my face (I know it’s bad). I also did not care much about my face and only used water or shower gel for cleansing after using make up remover wipes. I also did not use lotion/moisturizers.\n\nIn the past months of trying out products and reading this subreddit, I have learned so much and realized the importance of low pH cleansers, patch testing, moisturizing, etc. Despite dealing with contact dermatitis a couple times and more whiteheads or pimples than before, and having to restart my routine again and again, I am enjoying this trial and error process.\nHere are some mini-reviews of the products I’ve used so far. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Current Products:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Epielle Facial Cleansing tissues** – I have been using this make up remover wipes for years without realizing that it is made in Korea. It works well with removing most of my waterproof eyeliner before I wash my face. The one in white packaging does not contain alcohol and sodium laureth sulfate. It has cucumber extract, green tea extract, and aloe vera extract, but I think that gets washed off anyways. I use it because it is cheap ($1-$1.50) and it is easily available in Big Lots, Grocery Outlet, and online. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree The Minimum Cleansing Lotion** – This is my current first cleanser. I put it in cotton pads and soak my eyeliner with it. It easily removes the remaining eyeliner residue without making my eyes burn. It leaves an oily feel on my skin, so I use a second cleanser after this. It is great for sensitive and dry skin since it is alcohol and sulfate-free, but it has cetearyl alcohol, which some people are sensitive to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Cow Brand Gyunyu Non-Additive Cleansing Milk** – This cleansing milk is advertised as a make up remover that contains natural palm oil and olive squalene. It is alcohol-free, sulfate-free, and fragrance-free. It is non-foaming and very gentle. It feels “silky” on my skin but does not leave an oily feel. However, it does not easily remove my eyeliner (and that’s why I use make up remover wipes first). This also works as a morning/second cleanser and that’s how I prefer to use it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel** – I have only been testing this cleanser for 2 weeks and so far, I haven’t noticed any problems from it. I use this as a second cleanser after Innisfree the minimum cleansing lotion. My face does not feel dry or stripped of oil after using this. It does have a strong “pine-like” smell if you are sensitive to fragrances. Is this really discontinued or not?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kikumasamune High Moist Lotion** – This watery toner smells like sake at first but that smell dissipates quickly (I actually like that sake smell). This is my first ferment product and my skin seems to like it. My skin just seems to absorb the product easily. I use 3-5 layers of this depending on how lazy I am. The ceramides in it must have helped my skin recover post contact dermatitis from Rosette ceramide gel and Cosrx snail cream. It was amazing to see my skin change from dry, red, flaky and itchy to smooth, moisturized skin. As you know, it comes in such a huge bottle so you get so much of the product for the price. The pump on the bottle sucks, so I put it on a spray bottle. I use it on my body too and my legs are no longer flaky this winter. I also just started using this on my scalp after washing my hair as suggested by some on this subreddit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap** – I actually suggested this to my boyfriend who has oily skin and hates using spatula for moisturizers. He loved it! I tried it because I did not have another moisturizer after dealing with contact dermatitis. Thankfully, it is gentle and did not cause burning on my dry, dehydrated, red skin. This and the Kikumasamune high moist lotion helped my face recover and my flaking itchy skin is gone. It is also not as light as I thought because it really keeps my skin moisturized for several hours. I’ve only been using this for 2 weeks, so I’m still keeping an eye for possible breakout from cetearyl alcohol (I haven’t used much products with it) but so far so good. Take note that it is not entirely oil-free. It has lemon peel oil and tea tree leaf oil at the end of its ingredient list (most likely in small amounts).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch and Nexcare 3M Acne dressing** – These pimple patches just work so well! I love seeing how it absorbs the pus out of pimples and whiteheads. Cosrx is more expensive than Nexcare 3M but I think they are both very similar and effective.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Beauty Treats face masks** – I got these sheet masks from Daiso for $1.50 each. These masks have no alcohol, parabens, or fragrance and have minimal ingredients. These are soaked with essence, fit well on my face, and very soothing. Honestly, I think there’s not much difference between the different masks of this brand. The ingredients are mostly similar – all of them have hyaluronic acid, arbutin, cucumber extract, green tea extract, aloe vera extract and vitamin E. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**[non-AB] H&B Oils Center 100% unrefined, cold pressed rice bran oil** – I bought this to make sure that I am not going to have a bad skin reaction from rice bran oil since I want to buy the Kuramoto Bijin rice bran oil. So far, I am using this on my scalp and hair after washing my hair. This helps the ends of my hair look silky and less dry.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I will not repurchase:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n•\t**Cure Natural Aqua Gel** - My very first AB product purchase since my first visit in Japan. I wanted to see if it really removes dead skin or if it was just a gimmick. Turned out that it was just a waste of money and I finally stopped using it after realizing that it makes my skin dry and itchy afterwards. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam** – This was my first AB cleanser without enough research. My face felt so dry and stripped after my first use and I immediately stopped it. I later found out that it is a high pH cleanser. Everyone should definitely avoid this product.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX first essence** – I bought this without knowing what a first essence really is. It is a watery essence and it feels refreshing when you pat it on your face. It did not really cause me any problems but I stopped using this because I don’t think it was really doing anything for my skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Secret Key Aloe Soothin Moist Toner** – I thought this was going to be a gentle toner since it really felt like water. It did not feel refreshing, soothing, or moisturizing. It was just like tap water. I stopped using this when I started having mild itching every time I used it. I later found out that it contained snail secretion filtrate, which my skin is allergic to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin** – I am so glad that I did not buy the full size of this toner (which is huge!). It contains so much plant extracts that I don’t even know what my skin reacted to. I only patch tested it for a week but it caused my skin to have red bumps, itching, and whiteheads. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion** – This passed my patch testing but when I used it on my full face after 1 week, my face was the most dehydrated it had ever been. I used this on damp face and layered a moisturizer on it but it gave me whiteheads, dry, flaky, and itchy skin. I’m guessing my dry skin did not like the amount of hyaluronic acid in this. I was very disappointed that it didn’t work for me since a lot of people rave about it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Skin Softener moist** – This hydrating toner was actually amazing. I found out through this product that my face loves ceramides. It made my skin smooth and bouncy, but it is pricier than other toners with ceramides, highly fragranced (like a strong perfume, which I don’t like), and I found out that denatured alcohol was 3rd on its ingredient list. If you don’t mind its price and fragrance, I think it is a good hydrating toner for dry skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Etude House Moistfull Collagen Emulsion** – This was the first AB moisturizer I bought because it was highly recommended by Sokoglam. It actually made my face moisturized, my face felt smooth and did not have flaking. However, something in this emulsion was causing me multiple whiteheads around my lips and on my chin (possibly hydrogenated vegetable oil, alcohol, or fragrance?). It also smelled too “perfumey” and there are so much more better AB moisturizers that I wanted to try.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Emulsion** – Something in this product caused my face to feel like it was burning and made my skin flushed whenever I used it. It also left me with dry, itchy skin on the few days I used it. Unfortunately, I cannot find its ingredients anywhere.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX cream** – This is a blue colored gel moisturizer instead of a “cream” consistency. It was refreshing to use and felt “cool” on my face. It did not provide me with enough hydration though. By mid-day, my face was already dry again and craving for some moisture. I gave it to my boyfriend who has oily face and he liked it as a day moisturizer. It has high alcohol content, so it is probably not good for people with dehydrated skin. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Rosette Ceramide Gel** – This gel felt sticky when I applied it on my face but absorbed after 5-10 minutes. You don’t need to apply a lot of product for your whole face and neck. It initially made my face feel smooth and nicely moisturized. After almost 2 weeks of using this, I thought I already have my HG moisturizer. Then, I noticed that my jaw got itchy. I ignored it, and then my forehead got itchy. The more times I used it, my face got increasingly itchy, but I was in denial that it was the culprit. “My face loves ceramides, so it can’t be this!” Until, I applied it once more and my face got red and itchy just a few minutes after. I developed contact dermatitis possibly from the macadamia nut oil in it. My face was red, flaky, and dehydrated and I was so devastated because this gel has so much ceramides and I love its packaging. YMMV for sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All in One cream** – I was hesitant to use snail products because I was worried that I am allergic to it. Despite not knowing if I am allergic to dust mites, I just had a feeling that my skin won’t like snail but everyone raves about snail! So, I bought this and applied it on my right cheek. This is like a thick gel that has a slimy texture. A little amount goes a long way. My face absorbed the product easily too and I was really hoping that this would work for me. After one day, my nose felt very dry and I felt like I’m going to have a cold. I thought it was weird because I spent the past few days at home and was not exposed to anyone who was sick. The next day, I have full on runny nose. Four days later, I still had a runny nose (with clear drainage which is unlike a common cold where you get yellow snot – sorry if this grosses you out) and I had red bumps, redness, and itching on my right cheek after applying cosrx snail cream. I stopped using it immediately and felt relief from Benadryl cream. My “cold” also miraculously disappeared after I stopped using it. Well, looks like no more snail products for me ☹\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Shiseido Senka Aging Care UV sunscreen** - The first day I used it, at the end of the day, my face felt dry and it already gave me red bumps on my cheek, where I don’t usually get pimples. Those red bumps disappeared the next day when I stopped using the sunscreen, so they were not even pimples. This sunscreen actually felt nice to apply on my face though and dried matte, but I honestly won’t try it again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Canmake Mermaid UV gel** – I thought I’d give an alcohol-free sunscreen a try thinking that maybe the high alcohol content in Shiseido Senka sunscreen made me dry and broke me out. This did not feel oily on skin and also dried matte. There was a very slight white cast but not that noticeable on my skin. On day 2 of patch testing it, my cheek had red bumps that did not look like pimples. These bumps also disappeared as soon as I stopped using this. So, I think I might be sensitive to chemical sunscreen. The search for a face sunscreen continues.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I look forward to testing:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Hydrating Toner** – It contains 5 types of CERAMIDES! and fermented soybean! I got this from Amazon global japan and I just started patch testing it. It is watery but has a thin slimy feel to it. So far, my left cheek is feeling very smooth without flaking, even without a moisturizer on top of it. I really like its packaging too. It comes in a nice glass bottle that makes it feel more expensive than how much I paid for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Perfect UV protection triple care cream** – This sunscreen only has physical filters. This just arrived so I haven’t tested it on my face yet. Luckily, I work night shifts and rarely go out during the day so I can avoid the sun for now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk** – I have only seen good reviews on this emulsion and I just truly hope this works for me. To be honest, I really want this not only because of the sake ferments but also because of the sake bottle packaging.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Lotion** – I read that this is a better sake toner than the Kikumasamune high moist lotion, so I can’t wait to try it.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Rice Bran Oil** – 100% cold pressed rice bran oil from a Japanese brewery. I haven’t used other oils on my face but I read that rice bran oil is an occlusive. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Serum** – I haven’t really tried any other serums but heard good things about this beauty serum. If it will keep my face from getting dry, then I’m all for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask** – I obviously just want to try more rice beauty products right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Cleansing Gel** – This is a first cleanser with minimal ingredients and contains soy extract and hydrolyzed soy protein. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Muji seaweed shampoo and conditioner** – Well, since I love Japanese products so much, I might as well try a Japanese sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. I will have to drive 1 hour to get to the nearest Muji, but I will definitely get this. ",

    "body": "So let me keep this brief if at all possible. I have been experiencing itching, swelling, discomfort, and this crawling nerve issue in my vulvar region since September. I went to the gyno and she took a sample, lost it, and didn't give a freak about me and trying to make me feel better. At first my symptoms were mimicking a yeast infection, with thick discharge and everything. but once i did the second culture my yeast came back negative. Thinking about how I have had that issue in my past I just concluded that it was cytolytic vaginosis and was careful about my probiotic intake. I did the whole baking soda baths and it seemed to get a little better but it never went away. Then the crawly, creepy, almost vibrating feeling ramped up over the last few months. Pads made it sooo much worse as well. I finally decided to try Evvy - they said I was L. iners dominant and that I needed to increase good bacteria but I was hesitant so I took it slow. I started taking them and increased my good bacteria but I was still having symptoms. I then thought about it sooo hard like why did this just start, I was fine...what happened. I believe for the past few years I have had CV and I didn't know it but it always went away and came back around the week before my period. This wasn't going away!! What the heck could it be?!?!\n\nI realized around the time that this started I switched detergents and was using the huge Costco tub of powder detergent. It has \\*\\*\\*sodium lauryl sulfate\\*\\*\\* which a lot of women are allergic to down there!! It is also in ALL of the free and gentle and clear detergents! They're all a crock - it contains a \"less\" irritating version of SLS called \\*sodium laureth sulfate\\*. And beware of creams for itching, look at the ingredients!!!!! The main ingredient in one my Dr prescribed had SLS in it and made me 10x worse!!\n\nThen I thought okay I will buy a detergent with nothing in it. So I did..and my symptoms definitely improved but not the way I thought. Then I got this crazy idea to look into my vitamins. I started taking Vitex (chasteberry) for acne the same month I switched to Costco...what are the odds...and Vitex causes ITCHY VULVA!!! It was also in my multivitamin!! Everyday I was covering myself with panties that are making me itch and ingesting something to make me worse. I could not believe it. LADIES! All these multivitamins nowadays have \"hormone support\" but that stuff really messes you up if you don't really need hormone support. Be vigilant!!! I stopped all the vitamins, all the detergents, and wear no panties when I can. Even vitamins that I need that have \"added herbs\" or added concoctions of vitamins I avoid bc you dont know what these herbs are capable of. Nevertheless, I say all this to help warn you gals and let you know that since making these changes I feel a lot better, and I hope I can help just 1 person.\n\nJust go back to the basics ladies. Simple detergent, and simple supplements.",

    "body": "So, since I saw some discussion about using Dawn for wax, I can help to explain why it does *not* really work. \n\n[I saw a video on the other post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IeJsOR3V6g), and I will use that as a basis for products to compare. \n\nHi-temp wax: [This stuff is made from primarily Petroleum Distillates.] (https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&q=hi+temp+wax+%22ingredients%22&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR6p3fq6neAhVxS98KHTnHAGgQ5t4CMAJ6BAgHEAY&biw=1920&bih=968) which are primarily aliphatic compounds, with aromatic components. From the various products I have looked at, the distillates used in hi-temp waxes are typically light aliphatic compounds, but can be medium and even heavy (this just relates to the number of carbons in the chain). Due to trade secrets, no one really publishes the exact length of these chains. But they're likely C20 and higher (C15 to C20 would be stuff like vasoline and motor oil).\n\nCarnauba wax: [This stuff is also primarily aliphatic, specifically heavy aliphatic with (C27 to C31).] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226839615_The_Structural_constituents_of_carnauba_wax). It seems like carnauba wax could actually be heavier than petroleum distillates. This doesn't really matter too much, since that primarily affects the boiling point. The fact is, the primary compound in carnauba is actually pretty similar to that of hi-temp waxes. \n\nPretty much all waxes are mixed with things like silicone, sealants, thinners, etc to improve how they adhere (NOT bond, there is no chemical interaction happening) to the paint. \n\nNext, on to our removers/strippers\nDawn: Primarily sodium lauryl sulfate, the stuff in toothpaste, shampoo, and obviously dish soap. [SLS acts as a surfactant and degreaser.] (http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/SLS/SLSh.htm) It reduces surface tension, allowing water to cover more surface area. Next, the hydrophobic tails of SLS in dawn solvate and surround the fatty acid and grease deposits, holding them in an emulsion and ideally forming a micelle, which prevents the grease/fatty acid from re-depositing onto the paint. However, it's possibly the dawn foams and forms the micelles before capturing dirt/wax, especially on a very smooth surface (like a waxed car). Then it's washed away. \n\nM205: [The primary active ingredient in M205 is... petroleum distillate!] (https://www.google.com/search?q=meguair+m205+ingedient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-1-ab) I'm sure you've heard back in primary school that \"like dissolves like.\" Well, this is a great example of it! Water is polar, whereas petroleum distillates are nonpolar. M205 is basically a non-polar aliphatic solvent, which is great for dissolving a nonpolar aliphatic wax (the solute). This is slightly different from Dawn, which is partially polar and partially nonpolar. Once again, the exact chain length and amount of the distillate used is a trade secret, but it's basically nahptha, which is one of the best solvents, especially for wax. By mixing it with water, we are creating a solution that would pick up the distillate on the car and wash it off. But that's not all - there's also the aluminum oxide. This is the primary polishing agent, it is physically abrasive and mechanically separates and removes the wax. The aluminum oxide works to rough the surface of the wax, and then the products like the distillates and mineral oils can capture it in solution. They also can contain emulsifiers and surfactants.\n\nSo basically, Dawn does *not* work for a couple reasons. The smooth surface and additives of wax makes it harder for it to capture particles before being washed off. Longer carbon chains are *significantly* harder for SLS to hold in an emulsion and especially in a micelle, resulting in the wax just depositing back onto the car before being washed off. Something like M205 works by first mechanically disturbing the surface of the wax, and then dissolving it in the solution. \n\nDawn might work fine for greases, but not really for car wax. It would take *much* longer to strip the wax using dawn. I believe some engine degreasers do contain SLS, though. \n\nThat's a little overview. I won't go into pH, it doesn't actually matter much in a situation like this, but Dawn and Meg use slightly alkaline pH to help with stripping dirt and gunk off the car. I hope I got all this right; feel free to correct me if I messed something up. Hopefully this clears some stuff up. \n\n\nEDIT: This also explains why you shouldn't use Dawn as a regular wash - it does EVENTUALLY strip down the wax, just at a slower rate. This is why you should use something like Meg's Gold Class shampoo as your regular shampoo if you want to keep your wax on. \n\nSolvents > surfactants",

They even replicated the results with people on a survivor like reality show. While plaque on their teeth went up, the bacteria that causes cavities and gingivitis disappeared. Their gum health also improved.\n\n(They also ate sugary foods like berries and honey. Honey, despite having a ton of sugar, has been shown to have antibacterial properties and is probably fine for your teeth.)\n\n[The Hidden Epidemic - Interview with Dr. Thomas Levy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7s8susk4a4) (LONG video but WORTH the watch)\n\nThis video shows that all the abscesses from rotten teeth and gum disease are the cause behind most oxidative stress in your body, heart attacks, and even cancers.\n\nAlmost all heart attacks (the number ONE killer in America) had plaque and bacteria in it that causes cavities.\n\nThe pressure from the jaw while eating pushes all that bacteria in your lymph nodes and blood stream.\n\n\n# What About Acidic Foods?\n\nWhile, yes, people who eat a lot of acidic and sweet foods (like vegans) tend to get more cavities, it isn't the *main* contributor.\n\nHere is the thing: your body is built to handle acidic foods but not PURE SUGAR.\n\nYes, acidic foods will wear down the enamel of your teeth but those foods are only on your teeth for a little while—and your teeth are supposed to remineralize and heal any damage done overnight while you sleep.\n\n(Personally, I have a ton of cavities between my teeth because I hate orange and apples all the time and the pulp would get stuck between my teeth all day. Would I never get cavities there if I didn't eat processed sugar back then? I don't know. But I don't think it'll hurt to floss after you eat certain acidic foods like oranges and apple. If you can't floss, keep toothpicks handy. Even a rinse with water wouldn't hurt.)\n\nAlso, [wait about at least an hour after eating acidic foods before brushing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8BKmlTLwUo). They're in a weakened state, and you'll scrub off more enamel material.\n\n# Fix Your Teeth - Videos To Watch\n\nSo you want to start preventing cavities but not sure if you can COMPLETELY remove all that sugar?\n\nHere are some other good videos worth watching.

See, she knows what she's talking about!)\n\n**Add to your dental routine**: 20 minutes of oil pulling each day; water flossing after your brush; rinse with sea salt after oil pulling, flossing, or brush; and  mouthwash (herbal for gum infections or with fermented foods like coconut kefir of sauerkraut).\n\nThe only thing I'm not sure about is oil pulling based off the video on about [oil pulling risks (lipoid pneumonia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zf5PKnKIJc), how [oil pulling undermines the protective teeth layer against acid (at least temporarily)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=betOW0qVGLM&t=283s), but [oil pulling is as effective as commercial mouthwashes (however, so might swishing with water for 20 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72lfQUJo10k&t=260s) from Dr. Greger.\n\nSo if you're going to oil pull, do it before bed or wait a few hours before eating anything acidic. Also, don't swallow the oil, clear the back of your throat and tongue of any oil, and then brush your tooth using a different toothbrush rather than your regular one. And if you think you have any kind of leak into your nasal cavity, you shouldn't oil pull. See above for some great alternatives.\n\nFinally, go to your dentist! At the very least, they can see things in your mouth you can't. Yes, the [x-rays are bad for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYGkvMwqyys) (don't do them all the times and [get your antioxidant levels way up that day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAlUwBOk1kg&t=236s)), but you need to get checked from time to time. Better to tackle a cavity while it's small and where you can remineralize it, before it becomes a big problem where they want to do a root canal on you.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**Keep in mind, if you didn't grow up eating sugary sweets, you wouldn't crave them, they would be too sweet.**\n\n[Your taste buds adapt.](https://paleoleap.com/taste-buds-sugar/)\n\nBut all that the sugar industry cares about is selling more product.\n\n**Edit**: Added a *proven* DIY toothpaste (the lady claims the popular one you see online *de*mineralized her teeth, but she saved them with her formula), link to show that your taste buds will adapt, added the remineralizing master class by Raederle, Dr. Greger talking a ton about oil pulling, and a video on how another older woman healed her gums with off-the-shelf probiotics. Cleaned up the post with headers. Added more info on dentists and x-rays, and on acidic foods and brushing.\n\n**Bonus**: Watch [Root Cause (2018)](https://tubitv.com/movies/507721). Big thanks to u/DingleDoo_18 for the find and link.",

One downside to SLS is that in toothpaste, it can create micro-abrasions in the soft tissue of your mouth. *Some people* are highly prone to canker sores (read:me) and these act as nucleation sites for sores. I spent the first half of my life brushing with regular toothpaste and suffering canker sores, but since moving to SLS free toothpaste, my life has improved drastically.\n\n\nThe thing about SLS free toothpaste is that many of them also eschew fluoride.

    "body": "Keratosis pilaris (also known as KP) is a common, harmless skin condition where a protein in the skin known as \"keratin\" forms hard plugs within the hair follicle. It is usually referred to as \"goose bumps\" and appears as hard bumps. It is most commonly found on the backs of the arms and thighs, but can appear anywhere on the body, including the face (where it is commonly mistaken for acne).\n\nThe bumps will be very rough, sometimes appearing [completely skin colored](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-geh0uxMLnX4/TqYUVqUIqEI/AAAAAAAAAI8/fGQJQo5xpmw/s1600/keratosis-pilaris+arms.jpg) and other times appearing a [bit red or pink in appearance](http://www.skincare4uonline.com/keratosis_pilaris_up_close.jpg).\n\nThis is best diagnosed by your skin care professional -- the Internet is no substitute for your doctor's medical advice.\n\nHowever, if you have been diagnosed with keratosis pilaris and have struggled to manage it, here are some of the best, at-home ways I've learned how to cope with the condition.\n\n\n**CLEANSE**\n\nThis is actually surprisingly important with KP. On a whim one night, I decided to do some research about SLS-free products, being as SLS toothpaste can irritate the mouth and cause canker sores in some individuals. Since SLS is in near everything we use, I figured, \"Why not KP?\"\n\nSLS, also known as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, or SLES, also known as Sodium Laureth Sulfate, are common sulfates that add the 'suds' to some of your favourite household products -- from common toothpastes, body washes, and shampoo to dish soap, Prell shampoo, and laundry detergent. While there are health concerns over the effects of SLS, this post isn't to discuss that. However, it should be noted that some people are more sensitive to the potentially drying effects of SLS and SLES than others, and experience things such as dry skin and dry mouth (which leads to canker sores). \n\nWhile this evidence is anecdotal, I have noticed a tremendous difference in my skin by switching to SLS-free body washes. My KP has all but disappeared and there is nothing but extremely soft, supple skin where the chicken skin bumps used to reside. Your mileage may vary, but I highly recommend trying it for a couple weeks. \n\nYou may find SLS-free body washes at a health food store like Whole Foods or Trader Joe's. I have not found one yet at the common grocery store.\n\n\n**MOISTURIZE**\n\nWhen shopping for a moisturizer for KP, look for ingredients such as urea, lactic acid, glycolic acid, or salicylic acid. Your experience with each may vary -- while I do well with glycolic acid and urea, other KP sufferers do not notice any difference when using these ingredients. Some favourite products with these ingredients (US bias):\n\n* [Eucerin Intensive Repair](http://www.eucerinus.com/products/repair/eucerin-intensive-repair-very-dry-skin-lotion.html). This lotion is very thick. Some have described it's consistency to that of elmer's glue. It is very thick, goopy even, and can be difficult to spread. To use, apply a generous amount and work it into the skin, utilizing your body's own warmth to make it a more maneagable consistency. Recommended you apply it before bed.\n\n* [CeraVe SA Renewing Skin Lotion](http://www.amazon.com/Cerave-Renewing-Skin-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B0071XPQQ2). Contains vitamin D and SA, which may be helpful for some KP sufferers. \n\n\n* Coconut Oil. Some KP sufferers have found relief in coconut oil. Note that coconut oil should not be used if you have a coconut allergy and should never be used on the face without first spot testing, as it can be very comedogenic. Please be aware that there is only refined coconut oil and VIRGIN coconut oil. There is no such thing as extra virgin coconut oil. \n\n* [Amlactin](http://amlactin.com/) products. Smell a bit \"odd,\" but contain lactic acid. Smooth consistency. Don't recommend applying it to freshly shaved bits, since the lower pH can be irritating. \n\n\n**SOAKING**\n\nWhen I began running, I began soaking regularly in epsom salt baths. A surprising, unexpected bonus was that my KP began to disappear. I'm not sure why this is -- some KP sufferers think it is due to the moisture-rich environment epsom salts promote in the bath tub -- but it definitely diminished significantly. Of course, YMMV, but I felt it was worth noting.\n\nI also recommend against taking scalding hot showers, which can dry out the skin and aggravate any skin condition.\n\n\nHopefully this helps some of you out there. Please let me know if you have any questions, and *please consult with a doctor before diagnosing yourself over WebMD.*",

It wasn't until one fateful day in the grocery store that I ran across \"Vaseline petroleum jelly cream deep moisture creamy formula\". Now, I'm not saying that this is a miracle worker...but it might be. By the time I discovered it, I was 18 and had \"grown out of\" the worst of the KP. It was still noticeable (when the bf would touch my arms he'd wonder why I was so cold in the Summer?! Referring to my \"goose bumps\"). Anyways this cream eradicated what was left of my KP.

Same ingredients as their regular face wash, just without the fragrance.\n\nAlso tested: The Ordinary Squalane cleanser as this has a stated pH of 5.50-6.50, so gives a better idea of the pH of everything else. https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-squalane-cleanser-50ml\n\n\n- - -\n\n**Foaming**\n\nI wouldn't recommend these as they contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate which can be stripping or drying, but wanted to test the Aldi and Simple reformulations against the old versions and Lidl to show what the acidity is doing. \n\n-\n\nAldi Lacura “moisturising” foaming [old formulation](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8947438252.html)\n\nAldi Lacura “moisturising” foaming [new formulation](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2fd6438253.html) Always 85p from [Aldi](https://www.aldi.co.uk/lacura-moisturising-face-wash/p/055176005044600) —now has the leaping bunny logo on the tube. New formulation is more acidic than the old one and Simple.\n\n\n\nLidl Cien [“moisturising” foaming](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_c86c439285.html) (discontinued?) 85p in Lidl\n\nTesco also has a [foaming version](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/301360723) of their face wash, also £1.50. Didn’t buy or test this one.\n\n- - -\n\n**Misc.**\n\n-\n\nAlso tested some the Nivea non-foaming gel, pricier Superfacialist and cheapo “Beauty Formulas” (99p in Savers) face washes to compare https://imgur.com/a/de0AYyG one Savers wash is really acidic while the other two are neutral/alkaline. Nivea one doesn't have bad ingredients but is a little too neutral (not \"pH balanced\").\n\n-\n\n\nYou can always trust supermarkets and *usually* well known brands (some like Nivea are a little off though not harmful), but I’d steer clear of the weird shit Savers sell, unless it’s something you’ve heard of elsewhere.\n\n\nEdit: more info, fixed stray bracket that was breaking the Waitrose link",

The packaging states \"No sulfates.\" but also lists sodium laureth sulfate as an ingredient.\n\nThe company finally offered this explanation:\n\n>*There was a misprint on the sample package as it should say \"no harmful sulfates\". The sulfates in the formulas are an extremely low amount and are non-harmful!*\n\nPutting aside the definition of the term \"harmful\" and whether not sodium laureth sulfate falls under any definition of that term, I find it questionable that they would knowingly sell mislabeled product without at least a disclaimer about the mislabeling on the webpage where it is sold. I get that formulations change, but this feels lazy at best, deliberately deceptive at worst.\n\nFrom a customer service standpoint, things didn't really get any better from there. I wanted a sample of the current formulation of their Ghost shampoo (which *is* free of sulfates, including sodium laureth) sent to me at no additional charge. I was told that:\n\n>*I completely understand how the sample fails its purpose since it is a different formula, so sorry about this. Unfortunately, we cannot track the exact samples we are giving and if the formulas are the same as the current ones on our website. We completely understand if this solution does not work for you and so sorry for the confusion.*\n\nStill not sure what \"solution\" they're referring to as at that point they hadn't offered me one -- just an explanation. It took an additional 4 emails (out of 8 total) and me clearly stating that I wanted new product or a refund, before they finally just issued me a refund.",

In terms of safety, my understanding is that both products are  safe and both are at risk for the same type of contamination during processing but studies have shown that high concentrations of SLS over time can cause irritation(this may be the \"unsafe\" they're referring to). That said, SLS is largely safe and widely, widely used as a detergent. I've seen companies also say their sodium coco sulfate is \"cleaner\" because it's derived from coconut but SLS can also be derived from coconuts(and palm oil and petroleum) and it's highly dependent upon where the formulators are purchasing their products from and where those distributors are sourcing them.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the company is allowed to write \"free of\" on their packaging but that just goes to show you how the guidelines can be easily blurred. A lot of \"clean\" brands rely on free-of-marketing or faux-actives to make their products look superior to traditional ones or make you think that a certain ingredient is dangerous. That's not to say that you shouldn't use them if you like them, but there is significantly more R&D that goes into products produced by large corporations to avoid lawsuits.",

    "body": "So it was you, SULFATE SURFACTANTS!!\n\nI've had two patches of dyshidrotic eczema on my right palm for... I don't even know how long now, a couple months? And I've been using steroid cream on it for a while (betamethasone dipropionate in the form of Fobancort cream at first, and later Gentriderm cream which is slightly stronger) but every time it got a bit better, it would soon relapse again. It was extremely frustrating and I couldn't figure out the cause... until now.\n\nBoth my toothpaste and my shampoo contain sulfate surfactants in the form of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES). Aside from causing my dyshidrosis to constantly relapse, I'm also suspecting that SLS/SLES caused the dyshidrosis in the first place. I only have two patches of it on my right hand, but none on my left hand or anywhere else. So if it's a contact allergy, it would have to be something that only comes into contact with my right hand. I use both hands to wash my hair, but I only hold my toothbrush in my right hand, and toothpaste gets on it pretty easily. Thus, my right hand is in contact with more SLS/SLES than my left.\n\nI happened to get two sample packets of shampoo while buying stuff from The Face Shop (it's a K-beauty store, but I'm not a fan of most of their products for face - too many fragrances) recently, and noticed that it was free of sulfate surfactants. Instead, it used disodium laureth sulfosuccinate (DLSS), which tl;dr [isn't a sulfate and is very gentle on the skin](\nhttps://slsfree.net/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate/).\n\nI had also started noticing some itching on my right palm after washing my hair, so I decided to try the sulfate-free shampoo for a couple nights to see if it made things better.\n\nIt did. The redness and inflammation has gone down a lot in just two nights without relapsing, when previously it would keep coming back even though I was using steroid cream and Permasol (potassium permanganate solution, prescribed by the doctor to be diluted 1:8 with water and used as a wash, for drying out the blisters) daily.\n\nI also did a bit more experimenting by using another shampoo we have at home, which has ammonium lauryl sulfate and ammonium laureth sulfate instead of SLS and SLES, but my dyshidrotic eczema started itching immediately. (ALS/ALES are supposed to be less irritating than SLS/SLES, but evidently they're still too irritating for me.) \n\nI went out and bought the full sized sulfate-free shampoo, which is the Dr Schwarz Shampoo for Damaged Hair. It's normally priced at $21 (Singapore dollars) here, with the hair treatment conditioner being the same price, but due to a promotion I got both for $30, which is nice. I'm hoping that my dyshidrosis will finally recover without relapsing now that I've gotten rid of sulfates. I'll also be holding my toothbrush in my left hand for the time being... may look for sulfate-free toothpaste in the future as well.\n\nSo yeah, if you've also been playing whodunnit with your skincare / shower ingredients to find the potential cause of a contact allergy... it might be sulfates.",

    "body": "When I was diagnosed with rosacea and seb derm I obviously took a closer look at all my skincare and makeup. Switching up moisturizer, treatments, etc. was easy thanks to the enormous help of reddit but makeup was a lot trickier. I learned that a lot of what I was using had ingredients that were aggravating my redness and breakouts and I also couldn’t find a lot of seb derm/rosacea friendly recommendations besides green correctors. Being  a makeup junkie I took it pretty hard but I set my mind to find some options. So, after a lot of ingredient research, skincarisma browsing, excel ingredient checking and trial and error I’ve finally found some products that agree with my skin.  \nIn case it helps with my recommendations, I’m 33, my skin is dry (very dry in winter), and I’m a Mac NW15. I generally like dewy complexion products with a light to medium coverage. I have a bit of redness on the center of my face, some fading acne scars, a couple sun spots, and dark under eyes. I’m not going to review the products because there are fantastic bloggers that do in depth descriptions much better than I do. Nevertheless, if you have any questions I’d love to answer them.  \nEverything in the following list is fungal acne safe and has never affected my skin in any negative way. However, this products still may have some ingredients that could trigger some of us with sensitive skin. I’d keep an eye out for ingredients like butylene glycol, isostearyl neopentanoate, myristyl myristate, other esters, sodium lauryl sulfate and chemical sunscreens. I’m usually more strict with creams than powders because the amount of potentially triggering ingredients they have is usually greater in cream form. However, if it is a product I already owned and loved I just stick to using it occasionally instead of completely eliminating it from my collection. I also try to make some use out of them like using highlighters and bronzers as eyeshadows.  \nRegular primers:  \n\\- The ordinary high spreadability fluid primer. Super lightweight, helps a lot making everything even.  \n\n\nPore filling primers:\n\n\\- Innisfree no sebum blur primer (contains fragrance)\n\n\\- Nyx pore filler\n\nI just use them on the nose and around it. If I use them all over the face I look super matte and flat.  \nColor correcting primers:  \n\\- Nyx color correcting primer (green one). This stuff is the bomb. It really corrects redness and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. If I use this as a first step, I can get away with a tinted moisturizer or a low coverage foundation with no redness peeking through. Don’t go overboard or you’ll end up looking like Kermit’s girlfriend. It does have a sulfate so watch out if you have seb derm. I’d like to try the blue one, it’s supposed to be for sallow yellowish skin but it looked really illuminating in store.  \nI tried Makeup forever Step 1 skin equalizer redness correcting primer and it really doesn’t do much, the Nyx one is better, more brightening and way cheaper.  \nTinted moisturizers/BB creams:\n\n\\- Rimmel BB cream 9 in 1. It’s semi-matte but not totally flat. (has fragrance, parfum and a sulfate)\n\nNars radiant tinted moisturizer and Lancôme Skin Feels Good Skin Nourishing skin tint have esters so if anyone has found good alternatives, I’d love to know!\n\nAnother option I use to create a tinted moisturiser is mixing something like Dr Jart Waterdrop with a drop foundation. If you also add some sunscreen and highlighter you can put it in an empty cushion container and have a custom cushion to carry on the go.\n\nFoundations:  \n\\- Catrice liquid radiance. I’m a huge fan of this one, it’s one of my HG. It feels very lightweight and has a beautiful finish and an amazing price too. It’s the one with the least amount of potentially triggering ingredients I’ve been able to find. It has never broken me out or given me any issues. If you react to everything, I really recommend it. The shade selection sucks big time though!  \n\\- Bourjois healthy mix anti-fatigue foundation and Bourjois healthy mix serum light coverage liquid foundation. This ones are lovely if you’re on the drier side. The serum one has lighter coverage but feels moisturising. They have fragrance and alcohol in case you’re sensitive to them.\n\n\\- Dior backstage face & body foundation. Good but pricey. Tends to cling to dry patches. It has alcohol and fragrance.  \n\n\nAll the Mac ones I liked are out. I haven’t been able to find one without esters or oils. Same story goes with Nars and Clinique.\n\nFuller coverage:  \n\\- Rimmel match perfection foundation (does contain alcohol and parfum).  \n\\- Milani conceal and perfect 2 in 1 foundation.  \n\\- Maybelline Super Stay Full Coverage Foundation (has alcohol) .\n\n\\- Maybelline Super stay better skin.\n\n\\- Innisfree my foundation 1.5. Has fragrance. (there are different number options related to hydration and coverage, not all of them are FA safe). \n\nIf you have them revolution conceal and define foundation and fast stick base foundation could also be problematic.  \n\n\nDrop foundations:\n\n\\- Nyx total control liquid drop foundation. I love it mixed with a moisturiser and it can also double as good lightweight concealer. It’s on the matte side.\n\n\\- Kiko waterflower magic foundation pigment drops. Very lightweight and dewy.\n\n(Cover fx custom cover drops are out, they contain esters)\n\nI didn’t like these foundations because they’re too matte for me but in case someone prefers that look:  \n\\- Catrice HD liquid coverage (has sulfates and parfum)  \n\\- Nyx can’t stop won’t stop foundation (has sulfates)\n\n\\- Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Long Wear Foundation\n\n\\- Beautyblender Bounce Liquid Whip Long Wear Foundation\n\n\\- Fenty beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (has fragrance and sulfates)  \nConcealer:  \n\\- Urban decay naked skin correcting fluid. I’ve just tried the pink one, very good for shadowy areas. Has sulfates.\n\n\\- Peri pera ink concealer. It’s very nice for the face but doesn’t really cover my dark circles. (has fragrance and sulfates)  \n\\- Boi-ing airbrush concealer. Depending on the color you use, this one is very good to cover face imperfections. I don’t like it for dark circles. Not enough coverage and sets too dry for me.\n\n\\- Clinique airbrush concealer. Light reflecting, looks beautiful. No potentially problematic ingredients. It’s good but I like a fuller coverage.\n\n\\- Kat von D Lock-it concealer. It has esters but it has never affected me in any negative way. I just use it for the under eyes though.\n\n\\- Freedom Makeup London Pro HD Conceal Kit - Light Medium. You can do tons of combinations with it. To help with dark circles, sallow areas… Has glycerides.\n\n\\- Charlotte Tillbury magic away concealer. Give a very nice rich layer of color without caking.\n\n\\- Erborian touch pen complexion sculptor and concealer. It’s lightweight and pretty natural. (has parfums and sulfates)\n\n\\- Big Cover Skin Fit Concealer Pro. It’s too matte for the under eye but works great with face imperfections. Has fragrance and parfum.\n\nEven if I moisturize my undereyes, some of the latest full coverage concealers look dry and cakey on me. I’d rather use a creamier one and set it with a very light layer of powder. But if you have flawless goddess under eyes then you might like to try: \n\n\\- Nyx can’t stop won’t stop contour concealer.   \n\\- Fenty beauty pro filt’r instant retouch concealer. Has alcohol.  \n\\- Urban decay all nighter concealer. Has sulfates.\n\nI’ve never had breakouts from them on the under eyes but In case you already had them these have esters and oils and can cause problems:\n\n\\- Too faced born this way multi use sculpting concealer\n\n\\- Huda beauty the overachiever concealer.\n\n\\- Tarte Shape tape.\n\n\\- Ysl touche éclat.\n\n\\- Revolution conceal and define concealer.\n\n\\- Nars radiant creamy concealer.\n\nPowder:  \n\\- By Terry Hyaluronic Hydra powder. I love it, it’s one of the most finely milled ones I’ve ever used.  \n\\- Catrice nude illusion. Very nice for the price.  \n\\- Hourglass veil translucent setting powder. Also very fine and a bit glowy.  \n\\- Makeup forever ultra hd loose powder.  \n\\- Rms beauty Un powder. It just has silica and mica! I think it’s the cleanest one available. It’s pricey though.\n\n\\- Wet n wild Photo Focus Pressed Powder (has glycerides)\n\n\\- Wet n wild Photo Focus Loose Setting Powder.\n\nHighlighter:  \n\\- Revolution beauty liquid highlighter. It’s pretty much a dupe of cover fx enhancer drops but with a bit more obvious glitter.  \n\\- Urban decay naked skin highlighting fluid in luminous (has sulfates)  \n\\- Cover fx custom enhancer drops (be sure to check first, some of the darkest shades have potential triggers)  \n\\- Revolution beauty Vivid baked highlighter in Peach lights.\n\n\\- Nyx away we glow liquid booster.  \n\\- Nyx away we glow strobe highlighter (away we glow wand highlighter isn’t safe). These last too are more subtle, they’re great mixed with a tinted moisturizer.  \n\\- Revolution beauty Vivid shimmer brick in pink kiss  \nBlush:  \n\\- Kat von D everlasting liquid lipstick in beloved. As a lipstick it’s a dry hell but as a cream blush it looks amazing and has great lasting power. Has glycerides but those are only supposed to be a problem in high concentrations.  \n\\- Bell HYPOAllergenic Creamy Rouge Glow Stick.\n\n\\- Revolution beauty vivid baked highlighter in rose gold lights. Technically a highlighter but works like a blush if you’re a ghost like me.  \nContour/bronzer:  \n\\- Wet n wild megaglo contouring palette. It’s more of a bronzer on me, pretty warm.  \n\\- Nyx highlight and contour pro palette (powder). This is a pro palette that can be customized with refills. You could pop out a couple of bronzers and add some blushes. It has esters but it has never given me any issues. I use a very light hand though, it’s pretty pigmented.\n\n\\- Kat von D everlasting lipstick in sanctuary, it works because it’s pretty ashy. Since it’s quite dark a little goes a long way, I mix it with concealer.  \n\\- Wet n wild color icon bronzer (Fire and ice collection) in you’re dragon me down. Has glycerides.  \nFinishing spray:  \n\\- Skindinavia makeup finishing spray. (has fragrance and alcohol)  \n\\- Essence keep it perfect makeup finishing spray. Very few ingredients and very nice staying power. Super cheap!  \nAnd since reapplying sunscreen as needed is tricky when you’re wearing makeup I use a spray:  \n\\- Biore UV Perfect Spray SPF 50+ PA++++  \nI still haven’t been able to find a FA safe cream contour stick but I’m still on the hunt. I’m also looking for a safe full coverage under eye concealer that doesn’t set super dryl and accentuates fine lines. At the moment I’m combining different radiant ones but the staying power isn’t that great. Aaaah Nars creamy concealer, I’m missing you so bad!\n\nI didn’t buy all of these products. I had a few of them, I borrowed some from friends and I also asked for samples at places like Sephora. They’re often reluctant to give them to you or say they don’t have any but if you bring a little container and tell them you have allergies they’ll end up doing it. Remember that many high end brands let you return their product if you have a bad reaction to it.\n\nI intend to keep this post updated so if any of you have had experiences with some of this products I’d love to complete the info.  \nI hope it helps ;)\n",

    "body": "I (56F) have always struggled with dry skin, sensitive skin. When I didn't think it could get worse - post menopausal took care of that idea for me.\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago I discovered adding a drop of glycerin to my moisturizer in the morning and evening and it has been such a game changer for my skin. (Sometimes I add 2 drops in the evening).  Glycerin can be sticky if you add too much.  \n\nI came across a blog that was posted in the tret subreddit (the blog is for anyone struggling with fungal acne) and on the main page was a post for the benefits for glycerin.\n\nHere is a brief synopsis -\n\n* It reduces erythema a.k.a. skin redness. ([13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11301638/))\n* It retains water in the skin, prevents transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and fights dehydration. ([10](http://www.scientificspectator.com/documents/personal%20care%20spectator/Glycerol%20a%20Moisturizer.pdf))\n* It helps exfoliate the skin via desmosomal degradation, which is essentially the ungluing of skin cells so they can slough off.

    "body": "\nBackground: my fair hair is fine, but very dense, prone to dryness and tangles, and slightly wavy (2a, low porosity, for those who follow these things). \n\nI know there’s a lot here, but my perspective is that each one of these tips will give you a tiny boost to your hair growth and prevent breakage (which will eventually need to be cut off and count against your growth). If you do all of them, I think they add up to a big difference.  **Also, first post here so please let me know if I did anything wrong or should make edits!** \n\nLastly, s/o to the natural hair community for providing tons of education online. Turns out a lot of natural hair tips work well for extra long hair too! \n\n1. **Pre-shampoo.** When your hair gets wet, the internal shaft swells up and causes cracks in the cuticle, which = frizz, tangles, breakage. To prevent this, you can saturate your hair with product/oil before you wet it, similar to how blondes may saturate their hair before going in chlorinated pool to prevent turning green. I use olive oil because it’s easy and I buy it anyway, but Jojoba is supposed to be best because it is closest to our natural hair oils and can get into the hair shaft. You can pre-shampoos from Living Proof and Aquis. \n2. **Comb your hair BEFORE you get it wet.** Once hair is in the weakened wet state, it will break much more easily. Never comb wet hair.\n3. **Wash (and wet) your hair as infrequently as possible, and  with sulfate-free shampoo.** Sulfates, specifically sodium laureth sulfate, strip all the oils from your hair. Follow with silicone-free conditioner. If you take hot showers, turn the water down to lukewarm or cold before wetting your hair, and only wet it to wash it (don’t stand under the showerhead soaking your hair). \n4. **Dry hair with a tee shirt or microfiber towel.** These are much softer and gentler on your hair then regular Terry, which can raise the cuticle, which again leads to breakage and tangles. \n5. **Skip heat styling as much as possible.** I know heat styling is necessary for a lot of cute looks, but at least while we’re in quarantine it’s a great opportunity to skip heat styling. If you must heat style, use a heat protectant before you begin. \n6. **Sleep on a satin pillowcase.** No need to buy the expensive pure silk ones. \n7. **About 1x weekly, use a clarifying/scalp exfoliating shampoo** to stimulate your scalp. This helps eliminate any built up from product use and infrequent washes and keep your hair follicles healthy. \n8. **Day to day, try to wear your hair in a ‘protective’ style as much as possible** (especially during quarantine). Women with natural textured hair use this term usually to mean braids and other styles, I’ve interpreted this for my white hair as keeping it in two long braids, or a bubble **pony. The twisting involved in a bun can put strain on here.** \n9. **1x weekly, use Olaplex or another hair mask**. I’m low porosity, so I stay away from proteins and use a hydrating mask. To find out if you’re low porosity or high porosity, simply try floating a strand of hair in water. The more it floats, the lower porosity it is. \n10. **Consider a scalp serum**, or minoxidil (the active in Rogaine) if you have hair loss. In scalp serums, look for ingredients like plant stem cells, peptides, caffeine and rosemary oil. Even if a scalp serum is out of your budget (given many here are buying skincare as well), gently massage your scalp (without nails) for a few minutes each day to bring nutrient-rich blood to the follicles and stimulate growth.  These ingredients help to stimulate follicles and prevent 'miniaturization' -- basically the idea that every time you lose a hair, the next hair grows in a little bit less thick.\n11. **\\[SEE EDITS\\]** **Take biotin**, but only if you’re prepared for hair growth…. everywhere. Again, might be worth it during quarantine to get an extra inch even if it means prickles.\n12. **Get trims every few months**, but be VERY clear to your stylist that you’re actively growing out your hair. \n13. If your hair growth is still very slow, or your hair is dry and coarse persistently, ask your doctor for a blood test for **hypothyroidism**. \n\nHope this helps some people and please let me know if this is an okay post for this space! Hair growth requires a lot of patience, especially if you have slow-growing, difficult hair like me, so chin up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDITS** Thanks for the awesome comments guys! A few things I learned\n\ni) Biotin definitely seems to cause skin issues for many. I have dry skin and have never had an issue, but there's great info below for anyone acne-prone.\n\nii) For truly curly hair, combing dry hair is a big no! See the comments for more info.\n\niii) ACV rinses are great for shine and detangling! I use white vinegar if my hair is starting to get really matted (cute, I know).",

    "body": "Curious if anyone else has had similar experience? For years and years I’ve always had really fine skin peel from the insides of mouth after brushing my teeth. It’s pretty gross when I’ve like fallen asleep on the commute on a morning , or overnight, to discover this slimy white gunge but it’s never painful. Once I’d got rid of it through swallowing or spitting it out if possible pretty much forgotten about for the rest of the day.\n\nI noticed it was less severe when not using whitening toothpastes but would still suffer it to some degree. My consultant usually asks if I’m suffering any ulcers or sores in mouth and I always say no thinking I’m in now way suffering anything uncomfortable in my mouth, I just never made the connection before, or only had the idea to mention it after the event and usually the next opportunity is about 6 months away.\n\nSo one morning I’m just sat there on the loo, really stressed and upset in a flare up, thinking I’ve done everything I can possibly think of and there’s gonna be no doubt I’m gonna have to go something more hardcore meds’ wise and just dreading the idea. I’m running my tongue round my mouth swiping out white fine skin peel gunge, picking it out, flicking it into the sink to rinse it away and my consultant asking me about ulcers comes to mind. When she’s asked me this it always been along the lines, I considered she was meaning, was, is my Crohn’s so bad it’s working it’s way up to my mouth and people must be really bad if they suffer this - but, what if something in my mouth is affecting my insides?\n\nI learn more about this mouth skin peeling issue and figure out it’s down to a detergent in toothpaste called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I find a variety of online articles some from like the alt-health scene banging on about cancer and that kinda thing and other sources saying it doesn’t cause it which seemed more convincing and reliable sources. I can’t find anything relating to Crohn’s symptoms but do discover stuff about how they trigger symptoms in mice for research using, what I think is also a similar chemical to SLS. It appears same chemicals can have different names so I’m not really sure if it is or not I’d love for someone to clarify this for me.\n\nAnyways I think it can’t harm to just totally avoid SLS for a bit so trial some “natural” toothpaste. (I’ve since found some brands of more commercially available SLS toothpaste too actually) It can’t hurt to try anyway I think, I’m not depriving my body of any nutrients or putting anything worse in my body so why not.\n\nWithin four days, my stools bulked up, frequency of pooping per day totally calmed down and I have been really very stable for about 5 months now. I have not been completely symptom free by any means. My last colonoscopy showed I had quite angry inflammation in my tail pipe end and my main gripe was mornings when I’d need to empty out in a couple - 4 sittings before heading to work but over time this has improved to one or two sittings.\n\nI mentioned this to my GP I was so amazed by the improvements. He said quite honestly he’d never heard toothpaste causing Crohn’s symptoms, but if I think it’s helping carry on. Keen to discuss properly with my consultant but she’s very by the book and poo pooed any ideas about trying to help myself using theories around diet and stuff, though I did find they relieved symptoms anyway. I’m worried my consultant will think I’ve jumped on some tin foil hat conspiracy theory, but I would be so happy and relieved if it was proven to show I had an extreme sensitivity to SLS and I can just avoid it forevermore and move on with my life and continue to improve my health day by day by not taking drugs.",

Multiple times I saw comments implying or straight saying they knew better than doctors.\n\nThere so much bad science being push as evidence that it it’s cringeworthy.\n\n“You’re wrong killerkelp! Look at my sources!”\nI read them. I also read on how stupidly high they a dosing the mice. Unless you are squeezing a tube of toothpaste into your mouth everyday, it’s more likely that you saw the change you expected to see. And you probably did feel better. It’s been observed that the [expectations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo) of the subject can great affect the outcome. And that’s why your doctor might not discourage a holistic approach. \n\nAnd to anyone who thinks they know better than the doctors: ** fuck off**\nY’all know we would all be dead without medical treatment at one point or another.\n\n2) Diet. People get really defensive about this. It’s not wrong to say that diet doesn’t bit cause IBD. What should be clarified is diet *helps* with symptom control.\n\n“But killerkelp, my diet controls my IBD!” \nIt’s unlikely. Just as there are people who simpler don’t seem to respond to any treatment, there are people who spontaneously go into remission and remain in remission. I see a lot of people conflating symptom control with remission or assuming it caused remission. At worst, as a cure.\n\n\nIf diet or “organic” products (I swear I nearly burst a blood vessel when I see that buzzword) make you feel better, please keep doing it. If [lounging naked under the first rays of the sun](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/ben-franklin-slept-here-112338695/) makes  you feel better, have at it. \n\n\nBut we should not at any point being encouraging then notion doctors are wrong or trying to hurt us.

Nothing horrific per se, but pretty consistent breakouts around my mouth/chin/jaw. I would also get super chapped lips and small cracks at the corner of my mouth ([angular chelitis](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/angular-cheilitis)) that wouldn't go away regardless of how much water I drank, how often I brushed my teeth, etc., which would lead to nasty perioral dermatitis flare-ups.\n\nI had tried truly everything; facials, different dermatologists, various at-home regimens, lasers, oral medications, and NOTHING helped.\n\nOne day a few months ago, I was trolling the internet for ways to soothe my miserable lips, and stumbled upon a thread discussing AC, and how many found success once they cut out fish-oil supplements (apparently it increases your body's vitamin-A levels which can trigger acne in some) and toothpaste with sodium lauryl sulfate. I immediately cut out both and a few things happened:\n\nWhen I cut out fish oil, within a few days, my skin became less irritated as a whole. The random bouts of nausea that I had become so accustomed to quelled, as did my acid reflux and relentless bloat. My sleep improved, headaches went away, perioral derm simmered immensely.\n\nNixing SLS toothpaste though was where the real magic happened. Within 48 hours, my AC was fully gone. My PD continued to heal, the skin around my mouth became more hydrated and supple, and the small blackheads that would pop up seemingly randomly all over my face just... vanished. To test my hypothesis, a few days ago I tried using my old Colgate toothpaste, and sure enough, I woke up the next morning with the familiar early signs of AC at the corner of my mouth, and my chin was already looking a bit flaky and irritated.\n\nI should mention, in addition to these two changes, I have been doing other things that I'm sure have contributed to my improved skin. But getting rid of fish oil and SLS-based products has had the most drastic and immediate effect on my skin that I have ever experienced in the 12 years (SHEESH) I've been trying to figure this out. Happy to share the other changes I've made, but bottom line, I think all of my skin woes can be boiled down to allergies. This was something that never really occurred to me before, as I've always prided myself on being able to eat whatever tf I want lol. But turns out I am but a mere human, and am now kicking myself for not putting 2+2 together sooner.",

    "body": "Hey everyone -- there's a lot of detail below, but it's organized as favorite to least favorite. And [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)'s a link to my last post, where I speak to some of the products that I skip mentioning here.\n\n**Product reviews**\n\n* **iS Clinical Active Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is my HG exfoliant. It's the perfect strength for my skin. p50 was perfect before I started using retinoids (although I never tried the lower strengths), but this formula is the perfect formula to purify my oily T-zone while not causing irritation on dry-tending cheeks.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* Either in the AM or PM, every other day (alternating with a retinoid). I use 5 drops on face and neck, applied with my hands on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of common suspects: glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol. None of these are terrible worth going into, although super sensitive folks may have trouble with the alcohol denat.\n      * Arbutin: skin-lightening ingredient that [works differently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632348/) than Vit C or licorice, so their effects can be complementary.\n      * Salix Alba (willow) bark extract: natural source of salicylic acid.\n      * Saccharum Officinarum Extract: natural source of glycolic acid.\n      * Bilberry extract: blueberry-like fruit with soothing and anti-aging properties. It's a [strong antioxidant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vaccinium-myrtillus-fruit-extract.html) due to the anthocyanins in the fruit (which give the skin its dark blue color).\n      * Polyporus Umbellatus Extract: source of kojic acid, which has skin brightening properties. It is also antimicrobial, according to the iS Clinical [website](https://isclinical.com/ingredient/view/index/id/5778).\n      * Menthol: this one is controversial. It's listed as an irritant, and I certainly don't want to dispute that. I also know that menthol is used in a wide variety of formulas (e.g., IcyHot), so I think it's worth trying and maybe backing off if you have trouble. \n* **Tata Harper Superkind Softening Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* It feels like washing your face with floral honey, and it really does calm the skin. A 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 125mL\n   * *How I use it:* Everyday once (try to minimize since it's pricey). In the shower and rinse. Sometimes on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * A powerful suite of emollients (which I'm OK with as an oily-combo skin type since it's a cream cleanser): evening primrose oil, apple seed oil, castor oil, jojoba seed oil, squalane, grape seed oil, and sunflower oil. Note these are all mid-low comedogenicity.\n      * Lactic acid serves as a very gentle exfoliant, although % is not listed.\n      * Olivem 1000, which is a combo of ingredients used to emulsify the formula. However, Olivem 1000 puts the products into a liquid crystal structure, which is supposed to absorb into the skin with increased efficacy. *To look for Olivem 1000 in a product, look for Sorbitan Olivate and Cetearyl Olivate.*\n      * Soothers in this formula are abundant (hence \"Superkind\"): prickly pear, calendula (#1 ingredient), and chamomile are the stars.\n      * Magnolia extract is another ingredient worth mentioning in this formula: it's a popular addition [for Nivea](https://www.nivea.com.au/advice/skin/magnolia-extract) as well. It has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and softening effects.\n      * There are a number of natural surfactants (it is a cleanser after all): decyl glucoside, and shea butter glycerides as the primary ones.\n      * As for all of Tata Harper's products (that I know of): there is fragrance. If you're super sensitive, proceed with caution.\n* **Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix and is loaded with natural goodies in classic Tata fashion. It works well with the resurfacing mask, and is an effective formula for increased shine and deeper subsequent product penetration.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 120mL\n   * *How I use it:* Twice a week, once with the resurfacing mask (see below for details).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix: physical exfoliants include kaolin clay, apricot seed powder, and rice extract. These are quite small and I have found to be pleasant as a compounding abrasive agent. For chemical exfoliants, we have Salix Alba extract and pomegranate enzyme.\n      * Some more under the radar ingredients: Olivem 1000, radish root extract, superoxide dismutase, which is an effective antioxidant for protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS). \n      * Aloe juice is near the top of the list and is soothing (as we know).\n      * Plenty of other good emollients in this formula as well (sunflower seed oil, olive oil). \n      * Lots of powerful fruit extracts in here, too (classic Tata): elderberry extract, alfalfa, and meadowsweet are the major ones. These are mostly antioxidant and antimicrobial actors in the formula.\n      * There are a few potential irritants in this formula, so maybe try the small size first to see if it agrees with your skin.\n* **Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% 5/5** There are only 5 ingredients in this formula, with AA as one of them. It's a good alternative for me vs. SC CE Ferulic since it's less comedogenic. It will oxidize quickly (as I've heard) so I usually keep this in the fridge. Retro-fitting a pump (vs. dropper) is a good idea, too. It smells good, too. It's $94 for 1oz. I use it after cleansing in the AM.\n* **EltaMD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 5/5** Enough has been written about this brand and formula, so I'm not going to dive deep here. That said, it's physical/chemical and broad spectrum, has niacinamide, lactic acid, and is oil-free. It's a great option for sensitive, acne-prone skin. The tint was too obvious for my skin, so I prefer the clear version.\n* **Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* If you have very oily skin, I would maybe avoid this formula. There are a number of somewhat comedogenic oils, but it may still be worth a try as comedogenicity is not always 1:1. It's a gorgeous formula and truly unique. My skin is oily-combo, and it works (and smells) like a charm. 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $130 for 1.7 fl oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it everyday during my morning routine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Same idea as the mask. I can't speak to everything in this…you'd have to be a cosmetic botanist to do that…\n      * A number of interesting oils in this formula which tend to not be comedogenic: sandalwood oil, squalane, apple seed oil, evening primrose oil, sea buckthorn oil. Sandalwood oil is high in Ximenynic acid, [which is a potent anti-inflammatory agent](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Detail/1777/556915/Pure-Australian-Sandalwood-Seed-Oil). Evening primrose has a lot of [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well](https://www.byrdie.com/evening-primrose-oil-for-skin-5215964), although it falls in the middle of the comedogenicity rating. Sea Buckthorn oil is also an-\"it\" oil recently. It's also high in antioxidants incl. vit C., regulates sebum production, has antimicrobial properties, and obviously moisturizes ([source](https://www.byrdie.com/sea-buckthorn-oil-5210082)). Since this is a formula for blemish-prone skin, the formula is sebum-conscious. That said, if you have very oily skin, I would test before committing to the full bottle.\n      * Lots of soothing agents in here: Aloe, calendula, lactobacillus ferment, arnica, multiple types of HA, tremella extract (mushroom with outstanding humectant properties).\n      * The antioxidants in this formula are powerful (including the oils mentioned above): borage leaf extract, Tasmanian pepper extract, fermented bamboo, sea fern extract. \n      * As far as anti-acne agents, Zinc + Salix Alba bark extract are the main factors. \n      * There's also Alpha-Glucan oligosaccharide, which is [supposed to be](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/2510/74697/BioEcolia) beneficial for the skin microbiome.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel:** **5/5**\n   * *Summary:* So this serum is a go-to for me as someone with combination skin that tends toward redness. A 100% RP. 5/5.\n   * *Cost:* $78 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* The serum is something I put up to augment any active I use, and I love it for that reason. It’s hydrating, calming, and smells good, and it ultimately is the most frequently used product in my routine. \n   * *Ingredients:* There are a number of interesting ingredients in this formula: \n      * Olea Europaea Leaf Extract is olive leaf extract, and it’s shown some promise in [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333467/) study (although it’s a small group, not double blind or randomized, and technically doesn’t meet statistical significance thresholds). That said, PC has [great things to say](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-olea-europaea-leaf-extract.html). Major benefits are improvement in skin texture, some photoprotection, and antioxidant properties (high in catechin and rutin, both bioflavonoids). \n      * There’s also cucumber fruit extract, which has moisturizing (no surprise, it’s 95% water), antioxidant (some Ascorbic Acid, some flavonoids), and conditioning properties. Cucumber is one of the rare instances of a non-sensitizing fragrance. \n      * This formula also has grapefruit extract and thyme extract — consensus from outside SkinCeuticals seems light to mid on both of these. \n      * The formula has a small amount of Morus Bombycis Root Extract, which is derived from mulberry and has arbutin in it, which as we know is good for skin lightening as it’s a hydroquinone derivative. \n      * There are a few icks in this formula (fragrance, linalool, etc.), but overall I have found it to be very calming and pleasant. \n* **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Sleepair Intensive Mask 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a thick, non-comedogenic formula with intense soothing effects. It will likely pill, but it's intended for night use, so that shouldn't be an issue. I prefer this to the SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque. Will RP.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 110mL\n   * *How I use it:* I only use this for irritated skin, which it promptly resolves over night.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * As far as moisturizing factors, this product has over ten humectants: propanediol, glycerin, trehalose being the highest on the ingredient list\n      * There are a smaller number of emollients: only true oil being moringa seed oil, which is far down the ingredient list. Point being: *this product is thick but has not been comedogenic in my experience.*\n      * The real power of this product is in the soothing ingredients it offers: gotu kola (cica) being the featured #1. Gotu Kola contains a number of active compounds, including madecassoside, which has been shown to work as a [wound-healing agent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18503551/), an [anti-hyperpigmentation agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290557/), and a soothing ingredient [potentially effective](https://www.seppic.com/en/clean-moisture-lotion-as40140a) for atopic dermatitis (eczema). There are more soothing agents in this formula—without listing them all, suffice it say that Dr. Jart+'s chemists know what they're doing.\n      * There is also Niacinamide, Curcumin extract, Adenosine, Cacao seed extract, and other antioxidant ingredients for a nourishing blend.\n* **CeraVe SA Cream for Rough and Bumpy Skin 5/5** \n   * Summary: It's a standard (not lux) product which is effective for KP. It works.\n   * Cost:\n   * How I use it: I use it on the body (esp. on the thighs). 2x/day.\n   * Ingredients:\n      * It's a thick formula (lots of ceramides, corn oil, paraffin, mineral oil, cholesterol), but it's interestingly not comedogenic (also because it's indicated for body use vs. face). \n      * In terms of actives, we have lactate, vit E, salicylic acid, niacinamide, and phytosphingosine.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* A multi-tasking superformula with growth factors derived from human fibroblasts. It's very expensive, and it's something that I don't think I will repurchase (not because it doesn't work) but because anti-aging isn't my #1 priority. While my skin is young, I'm focused on anti-acne and hyperpigmentation, but for folks who want to improve collagen and elastin production, this is it.\n   * *Cost:* $295 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* After microneedling at home, once or twice a week. \n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * TNS (total nutrient system): this is a medium that is harvested from propagated human fibroblasts. This medium is rich in nutrients and signaling compounds that trigger collagen and elastin production.\n      * Lots of other goodies: peptide complexes such as whey, lactococcus ferment, algae extract, usual suspects for humectants, fruit extracts such as apple and grape, pullulan, lecithin (for creating liposomes which deliver actives deeper into the skin).\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel: 5/5 — with caution**\n   * *Summary:* This is a strong cleanser and should only be used for folks with oily skin. It has a cooling effect, which is pleasant, but the combination of actives in this is no joke. If you have really congested, clogged pores, I would recommend it. It's cheap enough, and strong enough, that I only need a bit and can use it as a semi-regular purge. It's an RP for me.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 240mL\n   * *How I use it:* I usually only use it in my T-zone, leave it on for no more than 3 minutes and rinse.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Sodium Laureth Sulfate: Chief Bubble Officer. [Less irritating](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12641575/) than Sodium *Lauryl* Sulfate.\n      * Glycolic acid: most researched and effective AHA. We know this sloughs off the top layer of dead skin cells. \n      * Salicylic acid (SA): an HG for acne treatment. Is lipid soluble so it can penetrate more deeply into the sebaceous gland and provide a better decongesting effect. This is in addition to exfoliating properties acting at the skin surface (although inferior to glycolic in that respect).\n      * Capryolyl Salicylic acid (LHA): this is a compound developed by L'Oreal to be a more lipophilic version of SA, providing better penetration. The study is from 2007 and 100% sponsored by L'Oreal but you can read it [here](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(06)03022-2/fulltext) if you're interested. There is some hubbub about pregnancy safety; do your own research on that front if that's applicable to you.\n      * Menthol: provides a nice cooling but can be sensitizing. [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-menthol.html) is pretty adamant against it, but I don't really give it too much stead. They cite pretty old research. I don't think my skin has been sensitized from it. There is [some newer evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620938/) of it promoting wound healing.\n      * [Sorbitol](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-sorbitol.html): A sugar substitute that acts as a humectant. Interestingly, it can also act as a prebiotic. Certain bacteria on your skin can convert sorbitol into beta-glucan, which calms the skin. Beta-glucan is partially responsible for the calming effect of oats and seaweed\n* **PCA Clearskin Lightweight Moisturizer:** **4/5**\n   * *Summary:* Overall, I find this product to be hydrating and non-offensive. To be honest, I don't know that it surpasses my OG in this category (non-comedogenic moisturizer) which is Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel. Although, if you need something more emollient than that, this is a very good option.\n   * *Cost:* $57 for 1.7oz\n   * *How I use it:* This is a good option for night time for those with oily skin. It might be too thick to put under an occlusive sunscreen during the day esp. if you run oily. Otherwise, daytime fine, too.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Ethylhexyl Isononanoate (say that 5 times fast) is the primary emollient here, and to be honest I can’t find much in the way of research on this compound. That said, I really trust PCA because your ingredients must really be top notch if you’re going to have the most bland packaging known to man. Murad and EltaMD also seem to be fans of it, which is a good sign. There are a number of other emollients, preservatives, and viscosity controlling agents which are probably not worth mentioning (they're pretty inert as far as those go). \n      * Borage seed oil has a comedogenicity rating of 2 (out of 5, 5 being instant pimple) and is very high in GLA (gamma linolenic acid) which [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-gamma-linolenic-acid-gla.html) considers to be a \"best\" rating. There is some good consensus that it has skin regulating properties (eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, etc.). \n      * Other calming ingredients: aloe, calendula, cucumber, chamomile (bisabolol). Has glycerin as well (although not too much). \n      * There is retinyl palmitate, which is a bit confusing to me, to be honest. If you're making a moisturizer for oily skin, I don't know why you would include one of the least active forms of vitamin A. \n* **SkinMedica HA5 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I think this is probably a miracle product if you have deep wrinkles. The five different types of HA are going to sit on various levels of the dermis, provide different hydration profiles, and sustain moisture in different ways. For me, as a younger person without deep wrinkles, it's nice but not worth the $ for me right now.\n   * *Cost:* $184 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Usually replaces a proper (?) moisturizer during daytime for me and put sunscreen on over.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * 5 types of HA. I'm not going to go through them, but there is crosslinked (bigger HA, which sits on top of skin cuz there's no way it's penetrating any deeper), hydrolyzed (smaller version but SkinMedica doesn't give the weight so hard to say exactly where it's going to land in the skin), plus the regular HA. I actually see 3 obvious HAs in the ingredients, not 5. Someone help.\n      * Texturizing compounds (HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Cross-p, polymethylsilsesquioxane) which give it a really nice slip feel\n      * Pullulan (mentioned this [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)) but this is the compound that tightens the skin and is used to create the Listerine sheets.\n      * Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape seed), which [PC loves](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vitis-vinifera-grape-seed-extract.html). It's antioxidant containing and many of them at that (resveratrol, anthocyanins, flavonoids, etc.)\n      * Vibrio alginolyticus ferment filtrate: This is actually a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, but this is obviously not a live form of it. Hard to find a lot of info on it, but[ it seems like](https://trulux.com.au/products/vibrio-alginolyticus-ferment-filtrate#:~:text=Vibrio%20Alginolyticus%20Ferment%20Filtrate)%20organizes,exopolysaccharide%20synthesized%20by%20kopara%20microorganisms.) it claims to be helpful in epidermal organization. \n      * Porphyridium cruentum extract which is a red algae derivative that has zeaxanthin, which is in the vitamin A family and has photoprotective properties. Jury seems to be out on efficacy.\n      * Moisturizing factors: Serine, Urea, Trehalose. Urea is interesting because it does have a function in rejuvenation (by breaking down a protein called filaggrin which helps organize the keratin in the skin at the top layer). This is thought to free up amino acids in the ECM.\n      * Skin communication ingredients: Whey protein, Plankton extract\n* **Tata Harper Repairative Moisturizer 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's not for me since my skin is oily, but it's a fab product if you're OK with emollients and fragrance (very well harvested and preserved via pump).\n   * *Cost:* \n   * *How I use it:* Since my skin is oily/combo, I don't often use this to be honest. This would be perfect for daily use for dry skin types or those that can get away with a product that gives some more shine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Simply too many to list. Check them out [here](https://incidecoder.com/products/tata-harper-repairative-moisturiser). \n* **SkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream: 4/5** Also not going to go super in depth here. TNS is the same as mentioned above, but this formula is a lot cheaper and has a much more emollient feel. I only use it post-procedure. Will RP when I have another procedure (esp. microneedling or Morpheus).\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 4/5** Not going to say a whole lot here. But I did figure out that the Vit E in this way causing some closed comedones, so I had to stop using it on the face. Won't be RP for that reason.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream: 4/5** Want to revise the record and say that I do believe this broke me out a few times on the face. Great for dry areas on the body, eczema, or post-procedure. Not great for face if oily.\n* **SkinCeuticals AGE Eye Complex:** **4/5 since I am 26 and advanced glycation end products probably not a huge issue for me**\n   * *Summary:* I wrote a review of this in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/), and I don’t think much has changed, although I do think that I can effectively minimize any irritation from this product with applying a small amount. I’ve taken a deeper dive into some of the ingredients. \n   * *How I use it:* Just a little bit below the eyes in the morning\n   * *Cost:* $105 for 15mL\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * First off, like 7/10 first ingredients are about viscosity and skin-feel and that definitely comes through when you apply the product. It’s hard in the jar but slips on the face very nicely. This is also good for ensuring it lasts a long time. \n      * There are also a number of compounds that scatter light such as Nylon-12, reducing the appearance of fine lines. \n      * It also obviously features Pro-Xylane (thanks L’Oreal). I tried to find some independent research on this (and [this](https://www.wcd2019milan-dl.org/abstract-book/documents/late-breaking-abstracts/45-wound-healing/proxylane-a-plant-sugar-derivative-9.pdf) is the closest I could find). Basically L’Oreal claims that it helps restore the ECM (extracellular matrix, which is where collagen, elastin, and many of the other things responsible for skin appearance lie). \n      * We also have Ascorbyl Glucoside (AG) in this formula, which makes sense regarding skin firmness and lightening. Jury is still out on in-vivo skin penetration of AG but it does create a reservoir of Vit C in the skin because it takes time for it to be converted into ascorbic acid (AA). \n      * There is caffeine in this formula as well, which we know is an antioxidant and helps with circulation.\n      * There is some UV protection from titanium dioxide. \n      * There’s also Hesperdin Methyl Chalcone which is derived from citrus and has blood vessel protecting properties. It’s at minimum an antioxidant and at maximum can help reduce dark circles due to its effect on vasculature. \n      * There’s anthocyanins in the form of bilberry extract but it’s far down on the ingredients so who knows how impactful that is. \n      * There are also a number of peptides in this formula which should help contribute to a firming effect. \n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a cult favorite from an iconic brand in the Green Beauty space. \n   * *Cost:* $68 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I use this once a week with the Regenerating Cleanser ([as Tata suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfrVxpoG_Nw)), which I use on dry skin and then layer with this mask. Leave on for 5 minutes, rinse, and my face feels great.\n   * *Ingredients:* If I had to write a complete summary of ingredients for all of her products, we'd be here all day & I would hit the word limit. So I'm going for an abridged approach.\n      * The primary active in this product is Salix Alba Bark Extract (willow bark) which is a natural BHA source. \n      * Despite being a resurfacing mask, there are a number of effective soothing complexes in this formula, namely 2 types of aloe. You could argue that Beet Root is a soother as well, although it's primarily a source of antioxidants and functions as a humectant.\n      * There is lactobacillus ferment, which Estee Lauder introduced in 2009 as a DNA repair enzyme and an antioxidant. There's also pomegranate enzyme which is extract using lactobacillus, although this functions more as an exfoliant.\n      * Radish Root Extract, which you'll find in Dr. Barbara Strum products + some (all?) versions of p50. This works both as a preservative in the formula but also as an antimicrobial on the skin.\n      * Kaolin clay — a gentler alternative to Bentonite which work as a mild abrasive and oil-wicking agent.\n      * Note there are a number of irritants in this product, so if you're sensitive to fragrance, be cautious.\n* **Maya Chia The Straight A Gentle Retinol Treatment 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I used this for 2 weeks. For the first week, my skin had a glow like no other. For the second week, I broke out. It's comedogenic for folks with more oily-type skin.\n   * *Cost:* $125 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night, after cleansing and a serum (optional).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of strong emollients which are plant derived and serve double duty as antioxidants as well: Chia seed oil, Rose hip oil, Raspberry seed oil, Buriti oil, Sunflower seed oil, Vitamin E\n      * Encapsulated retinol optimizes the retinol delivery system into the skin, and keeps it fresh for longer\n      * Natural retinol alternatives: Moth bean extract and bakuchiol which promote cell turnover (retinol's main mechanism of action)\n      * Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THDA) is a form of vit C which has [shown promise](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate) but is less proven than straight up AA. \n* **Neocutis Lumiere Firm Eye Cream 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I really like this eye cream and I might RP. I love the pump, and I love the packaging. It does make a difference and my sensitive eyes tolerate it well. I wonder if it has been slightly too thick for my oily skin even though the eyes and cheeks run drier.\n   * *Cost:* $108 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* In eye area (not above) once a day, very small amount gently rubbed in\n   * *Ingredients:* Not going to go into too much detail here: it has caffeine, vit C (as THDA, AA, and ascorbyl palmitate), beech tree bud extract, lecithin, HA, licorice extract for brightening, peptides, growth factors, and chamomile. It's a multi-pronged formula with a lot of promise and gentle but effective actives.\n* **Consonant Hydrextreme 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is an excellent humectant product. It's very simple. I will not be RPing at this time because it's a bit too simple for me + feels like it doesn't go as far as some of the other options in this space.\n   * *Cost:* $112 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* After actives, before moisturizer, with wet hands.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Glycerin: it's probably the least offensive and most popular humectant. You probably already know it :). This is a high concentration formula that is not tacky or sticky.\n      * Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide: this is a plant sugar with emollient properties and is a good source of antioxidants ([source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-cassia-angustifolia-seed-polysaccharide.html)).\n* **Aveeno Tone and Texture Renewing Night Cream 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's a good product. The PHA exfoliant is not quite strong enough for my KP so I will not be RPing, but it's a good choice if you have more sensitive skin on the body.\n   * *Cost:* $10 for 8oz on Amazon\n   * *How I use it:* On the body, roughly twice a week.\n   * *Ingredients:* I love the way that Aveeno breaks down the ingredients so see [here](https://www.aveeno.com/products/tone-texture-gentle-renewing-night-cream) if you're curious.\n* **Tata Harper Body Revitalizing Oil 3/5** Not going to do a deep dive here. The ingredients are quality, but it's too small of an amount for the price (considering that it goes on the body so you need much more).\n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Body Serum 3/5** Same thing here. It's a fabulous formula but it's way too expensive for how much you'd need to use on the body. The bottle might give you 15 uses on the full body, which is just hard to justify.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a calming masque and SC claims it decreases your skin surface temperature by something like 5 degrees (ok). It's been sitting almost full in my cabinet for a while — it's nice but won't RP unless it's for post-procedure for something majorly irritating (phenol peel?).\n   * *Cost:* $66 for 60mL\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never lol. Would be great for post procedure.\n   * *Ingredients:* There is not a whole lot of extra detail to add here as compared with the gel described above. There are a few additional ingredients that are worth mentioning: Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester is a dipeptide that has skin calming and fibroblast protecting properties (PC agrees but [here's](https://www.activepeptide.com/product/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester/) the link to buy it raw if you want to experiment yourself yikes).\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It is confused about what it is and who it's for. I don't understand why there's so much more bilberry extract than exfoliants. I understand that these can be irritating products, but it feels like SM is putting the cart before the horse here. It should exfoliate first and foremost, and for me, it doesn't. No RP.\n   * *Cost:* $48 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never. It's probably fine to use morning and night, but depends on your face + wear SPF always but esp. in the AM if using AHAs.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of Bilberry extract (2nd ingredient)\n      * Moisturizing/calming: Aloe, Glycerin, Squalane, Chamomile (2 types), B5\n      * Natural AHAs: Sugar Cane Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract. To me, these are not astringent enough to be effective. Perhaps it's the rest of the moisturizer and emollience of the rest of the formula, but I just don't feel that this sloughs off the dead skin in the way that I want it to.\n      * There's also BHA (Salicylic acid), Vit E, and Vit C (as ascorbyl palmitate). Like I said — confused.\n* **Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay 2/5** Not going to go in depth here. I don't think I'll ever \\*have\\* to RP (since it's huge), but I don't think I would. It's very good for removing sebaceous filaments and pulling oil from the skin. It's a bit strong, but it's a good option if you struggle with oil control.\n* **Avene Eau Thermale 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's just water. \n   * *Cost:* $20\n   * *How I use it:* On my face\n   * *Ingredients:* Mineral water. Be careful — it's pH 7.5. If you put this on immediately after any actives that require a narrow pH range (e.g., AA, AHAs/BHAs), you are going to inactivate them. \n* **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask: 1/5** Not going to go in depth here. Will not RP. It works but so does Aquaphor.\n* **Darphin Intral Inner Youth Serum 1/5**\n   * *Summary:* No change noticed during 2 months of use. Fragrance is a bit sickly-sweet. Will not RP.\n   * *Cost:* $50 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night after an irritating product (retinoid or exfoliant).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Chief function of the serum is soothing: it has panthenol, chamomile, and Alteromonas ferment (which is used across the cosmetics industry as a soothing agent).\n      * There is moisturizing action here, too: glycerin, glycosaminoglycans, castor oil (low comedogenicity). This is obvious from the serum nature of the formula, but it's certain not a moisturizer in and of itself.\n      * Peony extract is one of the chief ingredients and scents. Cannot find anything about the benefits of this.\n\nIn the queue next for me: is Clinical Cleansing Complex, Herbivore's Nova and Bakuchiol, Chebula Serum by True Botanicals, SkinCeuticals Retexturing Activator, Glytone Brightening Cleansing Powder, and UltraCeuticals Vitamin A serum, Vivier V-Stat Scar Gel — any experiences or thoughts are welcome!!",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

This might seem a bit silly, (but I'm trying to educate myself on the issue rather than avoiding products in fear entirely) since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it?\n\nAqua/Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Dimethicone, Coco-Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Ci 42090/Blue 1, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Mica, Coconut oil, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, Steareth-6, Acetic acid, Peg-100 stearate, Peg-45M, Argilla/Magnesium Aluminium Silicate, Trideceth-10, Trideceth-3, Salicylic Acid, Limonene, Fumaric Acid, Menthol, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Montmorillonite, Amodimethicone, Kaolin, Fragrance,  Carbomer, citric acid, Bht, Hexylene glycol, Hexyl cinnamal, Glycerin.\n\n\n[I'm well aware a question similar to this has been posted by someone else but I didn't see a satisfactory answer and thus I'm posting this]",

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

    "body": "I’ve lurked on reddit for years, and few days ago finally decided to create an account. First post! Everyone’s journey with Crohn’s is different, but I wanted to share personal lessons I’ve learned from having Crohn’s in hopes some aspect may be helpful for others.  \n\n\n**It took 3 years to get diagnosed.**  \n\nIn my late 20s, one day I got a stomach bug, or so I thought.  After a couple weeks, I started to get a little concerned.  After a month, I started doing some reading and went to the doctor. Doctor said oh you probably have IBS. No way.  After about 5 months of unrelenting stomach problems, had a colonoscopy. No damage. Fun fact: Crohn’s starts damage on outside of intestinal wall and over time works its way in, so no evidence of damage soon after symptoms isn’t conclusive.   It took 3 years before symptoms and damage bad enough that a GI doctor could diagnose Crohn’s. That’s about average for time from symptom onset to diagnosis.  \n \n\n**Be careful about laughing gas / nitrous oxide for oral surgery.**  \n\nIf this story even helps one person avoid what I went through, it’s worth sharing. I needed to have oral surgery, and surgeon asked if I wanted laughing gas. Sure.  Mini-operation went well, go home, take some codeine and go to bed. Wake up in middle of night, and feel like I’m about to pass out. Then I started uncontrollably shaking while conscious for about 2 minutes. No bueno. I go back to sleep, and wake up feeling great.  Sweet, that’s over.  That evening, when I get into bed, I realize my legs feel a little funny, but say oh I’m sure it’l be fine. Wrong.  I wake up in the middle of the night and feel “pins and needles” all over my body.  Incredibly uncomfortable. In morning, call primary care doctor and oral surgeon. No help, suggest stopping codeine.  Over the next couple days, the pins and needles became excruciating. The tingling was all over my body, and rose in intensity until it was debilitatingly painful. I couldn’t wash my hands or shower, because a jet of water felt like a thousand daggers piercing my skin. Moving? ugh. Staying still? ugh. Thankfully I had an appointment with my GI doctor. As soon as I described my symptoms and that I’d had oral surgery, she got all giddy & excited. She makes me tell my story. Halfway through,I ask if she can help. She says “Yes better tomorrow! Continue.” I finish story and she turns around the computer screen to an article in JAMA titled: “Is Nitrous Oxide a Dangerous Anesthetic for Vitamin B12-Deficient Subjects?”  Turns out that nitrous oxide binds to B12 and inactivates it, which if you don’t have extra B12, can cause a severe acute B12 deficiency resulting in neurons to misfire/die leading to the pins and needles. In most people this would never happen because of extra B12 in liver. However, if you have low B12, say due to have having Crohn’s (which can damage the terminal ileum — main place in GI tract where B12 is absorbed), there is a risk that nitrous oxide could cause a severe acute B12 deficiency.   As for the fix, MD prescribed intranasal B12 and my life went from unbearable back to completely better in about 12 hours. Important side-note: In patients with stomach problems (SIBO), a B12 test can come back normal even if you have a deficiency!  I am so thankful to my doctor for helping save me from more pain and potentially permanent damage.  \n\n\n**SLS-Free Toothpaste helped reduce severity and frequency of canker sores.**  \n\nSwitching toothpaste to an SLS-free version dramatically helped my canker sore problem. There’s some evidence in the literature that this works broadly (e.g., Chain et al 1997).  \n\n\n**Consider the benefit/risk profile of Prednisone.**  \n\nI was scared about the potential side effects of Prednisone, so I avoided it for a long time. However, after a few years, things got pretty bad.  I was in pain all the time, gas/diarrhea, couldn’t sleep through the night, and was tired all the time. Ended up losing a bunch of weight since not eating was the main thing that helped.  Oh and I had canker sores the size of nickels. Exhausting. During a flare up, I decided to give Prednisone a try.  For me personally, this was a great decision. Within 3 days, it was like I didn’t have Crohn’s anymore, and was able to rather quickly bring the dose down to 3mg, albeit with help of Humira. Never had any side effects that were noticeable. Two important caveats: 1. Research suggests side effects of Prednisone are minimized when below about 7.5mg (except for osteoporosis/cataracts).  2. I have had a much better experience with Prednisone than many others.  \n\n\n**Treating blastocystis hominis seemed to help me.**  \n \nOver the next few years, things went pretty well, but I had to slowly increase Prednisone dose by ~0.5mg / year to keep things under control. I went in to my GI doctor and asked him to think outside of box for possibilities. Turns out I’d never had a stool test for pathogens. Came back positive for Blastocystis hominis. I read a few scientific articles on it and talked to doctor. There is some evidence that treatment can help some people with stomach problems, and GI doc has seen it exacerbate Crohn’s in some patients.  Of note, about 25% of people have this, so clearly it doesn’t cause problems for everyone.  But I decided to try treating it, and took a week’s worth of Flagyl to eradicate it.  And I was shocked when I was able to for the FIRST time lower prednisone all the way to 0.  \n  \n\n**Pill-cutter was instrumental for tapering prednisone**  \n\nBelow about 7mg, the only way I was ever able to lower prednisone was by 0.25mg increments. The smallest dose they sell is 1mg.  That mean chop 1mg in half then choppy choppy a half in half. So after clearing the blasto, I lowered from 7mg to 0mg over the course of ~6 months by going down 0.25mg about once a week.  After getting to 0, it took about 6 months for withdrawal effect to fully go away. I could not have done this without my pill cutter!  \n\n\n**Diet doesn’t help all, but made a huge difference for me.**  \n \nMedicine was never sufficient to get/keep things under control. For me, a strict ultra-low FODMAP diet has been critical to keeping me healthy. If I go even slightly off the diet, within 12 hours I  have clear negative effects. As pointed out in a recent post, there is strong evidence that this diet helps people with IBS (e.g., Halmos et al 2014). However, there is also evidence that a low FODMAP diet can help patients with IBD (e.g., Gearry et al 2009). It’s interesting that a diet has shown benefit in both IBD and IBS — but is indicative of how relatively little understanding there is on IBD and the relationship with diet. If people are interested, I can post more on what specific version of the low FODMAP diet has worked for me and suggestions on how to try.  \n  \n\nChahine et al 1997: The effect of sodium lauryl sulfate on recurrent aphthous ulcers: a clinical study.

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have accumulated a great deal of different shampoos from various indie companies throughout my time here and I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on them!\n\nSince everyone's hair is different, your experiences might differ from mine, so just keep that in mind! For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

I looked up and down the internet and tried various things, none of which made it better. I finally found a remedy that worked for me that I will share because I know how utterly frustrating this condition is. This may not work for everyone of course and know that I am in no way a doctor so take that into consideration. I'm also not sure exactly what made it go away because I did a combination of things. But here it is.\n\nThings I did: Diet: -stopped taking fish oil pills and ate less vitamin A rich foods like spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes (I think I may have been taking in too much vitamin A and it was a cause in my skin breaking out) -in addition to the multivitamin I was already taking I added a combination B vitamin and an iron supplement.\n\nLifestyle: \n-stopped using lip balm that had any flavors. I used Burt's Bees original on my lips (not directly on irritation though)\n -bought a sensitive toothpaste w/o Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (I bought kroger sensitive brand) \n-brushed my teeth after every meal\n-stopped eating acidic foods that irritated the lesions (tomato based stuff, sauerkraut, pickles, etc)\n\nTopical: - after brushing my teeth after every meal I did these things in this order:\n 1.) washed area with antibacterial soap and dried\n 2.) put a Himalayan salt/water solution on it (so salt water with minerals) and let it dry\n 3.) put some clotrimazole ointment on it, covering the effected area \n4.) finally topped it off with vaseline.\n\nI also occasionally put Dr. Dan's Cortibalm lip balm between step 2 and 3 when I had it near me just to see if it would help. But it seemed to do ok w/o it.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps some people! Having angular cheilitis is the worst.",

        "body": "Thanks for posting your tips! I’ve had angular cheilitis on and off (mostly on) for the last 9 months. My doctor told me it’s because California is a desert biome, which makes the air dry and lips susceptible to cracking... I’ve lived here 20+ years and dry lips have never been a problem until this year with this angular cheilitis outbreak. Remedies given by my doctor included:\n\n• clotrimazole antifungal cream (1%) and hydrocortisone cream (1%) followed by lil balm once healed — kept coming back after it healed\n\n• triamcinolone acetonite cream (0.1%) followed by Vaseline once healed (strictly no lip balm) — worked for a while, but my lips were still super dry and dependent on Vaseline\n\n• The second solution worked better, but my lips became super dependent on Vaseline (without being applied every 3-6 hours, my lips turned to sandpaper).\n\n• I didn’t want to be dependent on Vaseline for the rest of eternity, so I switched to trying a mixture of tea tree oil + coconut oil, hoping it might resolve the bacteria/fungus AND dryness, rather than prolonging the symptoms with bandage solutions. Sadly, the first signs of angular cheilitis have now returned for the first time in over a month, but I also figure it has to get worse before it gets better so going to stick with this for a week or so to see what happens.\n\nOverall, the bacteria/fungus keeps festering, and I can’t figure out how to fully get rid of it. 😑 Going to try the vitamin route next (I take a multivitamin, but I’m going to switch to B/Iron supplements and stop fish oil for now).",

The largest was about the size of a half dollar and literslly covered the entire back of my throat, it was horrible. After that specific one I went to a doctor amd the nurse suggested finding toothpaste/mouthwash *without* Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I was skeptical at first but that was alnost 5 years ago and I havent had one yet. It is a bit frustrating sometimes finding products thatnuse glycerine instead of SLS but its well worth itbto anyone who suffers chronically from them. Be sure to check both your mouthwash amd toothpaste because ive found both usually contain them 99% of the time. A good rule of thumb I've used is just tonscan the ingredients and if i see \"glycerin\" listed that usually means SLS is not used as SLS is a substitute for glycerin.\n\nIt would be nice if more dental products had alt products without it that we, who suffer from cankers so badly, vould easily find and use. I think the only brand thats easy for me to find is a form of Sensodyne and evem them its only one specific \"flavor\" that doesnt use it.\n\nGreat lifetip!

    "body": "Continued from: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hk1g37/nopoo\\_no\\_shampoo\\_quick\\_start\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hk1g37/nopoo_no_shampoo_quick_start_guide/)\n\nI've done a lot of reading, thinking and discussing with people in the last few weeks and decided to almost completely rewrite the section on transition. Give me your thoughts and suggestions!\n\n# Transition: a Small Step to a New Lifestyle\n\nNow that you’ve started your no-poo routine, you’re going to experience what is called transition. This is the period of time in between the point when you slowed or stopped using shampoo and other products and finally stabilize into your customized no-poo routine. Depending on your product history, biology and approach to transition, it can typically last from 2-6 months.\n\nIt is a time of healing, finding a natural balance, and retraining your sebum production to be in sync with that natural balance. This is also often a difficult time because of all the new things you are experiencing and learning. It doesn’t help that your scalp kinda freaks out during this process and might become excessively oily, waxy, smelly, dry, flaky, and could break out a little too.  This will pass as transition does, even if it takes longer than you really want it to, and your scalp and hair will be healthier for it.\n\n## A Natural Kind of Clean\n\nNo-poo isn’t just about learning to wash your hair with just water or your kitchen cupboard, it’s about embracing your bodys’ natural functions and environment. Modern society and advertising has us convinced that horrible things will happen to us if we don’t spend tons of money on their products. If we don’t use antibacterial soap, we will get horribly sick. If we don’t use highly fragranced shampoo, body wash and deodorant we will be rank and offensive. If we don’t use tons of styling products, our hair will be dry and ugly.\n\nSo we destroy our bodys’ natural protections, both the acidic oily lipid barrier and the beneficial symbiotic bacteria, in favor of something that kills everything but the most resilient pathogens, which are then free to multiply because they have nothing left to compete with. Those highly fragranced body products are filled with chemicals and we have very little understanding of how they affect us and our planet, and quite a few people spend their lives battling irritation and sickness because of them. We wash our hair with shampoo, which is too drying, and then try to compensate for that with conditioner, which is filled with things that can only be removed by the shampoo. Then we add even more product with texturizers and styling creams, hair spray, mousse, gel, pomade...all in the attempt to replace what the shampoo stripped away in the first place.\n\nHair that is allowed to be itself is textured, interesting, healthy, easy to manage, and properly moisturized. Getting it there can be a bit of a trial, and part of that trial is modifying your ingrained expectations about what ‘clean’ is and how it feels. Being clean is **not** having dry, chapped, stripped skin that must be soothed by a multitude of creams and products, nor hair that is stripped and beaten into submission with chemicals and coatings.\n\nClean is having a healthy body with its natural protections in place, and hair that is properly supported by those natural protections. Clean is knowing how those protections work, and what to do to support them and maintain your own personal sanitation. Clean is encouraging your symbiotic bacteria and understanding that they fight pathogens for you, that they are not the enemy but your allies. Clean is understanding the purpose of sebum and that it conditions, protects, seals in moisture, learning to love the feeling of it in your hair, and embracing the comfort of knowing it’s doing its job.\n\nSebum is **not** bad or unhealthy, it is the best thing for your skin, scalp and hair. Transition is **not an endurance contest or a race.**  It is a small step towards a more natural, healthy lifestyle. Choosing to embrace transition will help you modify your expectations and make it much easier in the end.  You could look at the excess sebum as a new product you’re trying out and learn to work with it instead of just wishing it away. If you get some on your hands, just rub it in like lotion. Or you could rub it somewhere you’re dry, like your elbows or forearms. You might find that you enjoy the result of having your natural conditioning oil on your hands and body, protecting you from the things you interact with. It is a customized product that is just for you. And best of all: free!\n\nYou might also consider exploring washing your body with only water and experiencing the benefit of a body that is entirely naturally clean, but discussing that in detail is beyond the purpose of this wiki.\n\n## Things That Affect Transition\n\nThe kind of transition you have is dependent on so many variables it’s difficult to know what each individual will experience. We do know that the type of product you’ve been using and the frequency in which you’ve been using it will greatly affect the duration and severity of transition. How hard your water is can also affect it, but only because hard water makes everything no-poo more difficult.\n\nSurfactant cleansers (detergent based shampoos and conditioners) are classified by how stripping and drying they are:\n\n* Dandruff Shampoo: extremely stripping, drying, and harshly exfoliating. It is trying to remove everything that the fungus might feed on and starve it out as well as using medication to kill it. Using it is often a vicious cycle because of its drying and exfoliating properties. When you quit using dandruff shampoo, the scalp often explodes in a cloud of flakes because it is dry and irritated and no longer being exfoliated. This often prompts the user to start using it again, which suppresses the flakes again. Often the only way to quit dandruff shampoo is to accept that flakes will happen while your scalp heals and give it the support and moisture it needs to do so.\n* Sulfate shampoo: defined by the inclusion of sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. Sulfates are known to be very stripping of oils in the skin and are also irritants that cause dry, damaged skin.\n* Low-poo: defined by the lack of sulfate surfactants, but still containing other surfactants. Because it lacks sulfates, it cannot reliably remove silicones and product buildup caused by liquid plastics. A proper low poo also does not have parabens, water insoluble silicones or drying alcohols in it. Much gentler than sulfate shampoo, but still stripping because of the surfactants.\n* Co-wash: a conditioner that contains no sulfates, parabens, water insoluble silicones or drying alcohols. Classified as low-poo. Still contains surfactants, but also contains moisturizers which reduces the irritation caused by stripping greatly, and so is much gentler than any shampoo.\n\nThe duration between washes also plays a big part in how bad transition will be. If you’ve washed every day, transition will be worse than if you’ve only washed once a week.\n\nHard water turns oils into ‘wax’. This will make your hair stiff, sticky, difficult to brush and comb, and can dry out your hair because the wax coats it and doesn’t let moisture in.\n\nAll of this can allow you to make some intelligent choices about things you can expect and how you want to approach transition. **In the end, however, the best way to handle transition is** **any** **way that gets you through it.** Too many people treat it like that endurance contest that was mentioned earlier, and this often causes them to give up and quit. Don’t worry about how long it will take. Don’t worry about whether doing something will set you back. It all evens out in the end, and if you keep pursuing it, you will get there eventually! It’s better to do what you feel you need to rather than believing you have to just tough it out and then giving up because you can’t.\n\n## How to Handle Transition\n\nIf you’ve been doing something that will make transition more intense, the best way to approach it is slowly and intentionally. A nice low-poo or co-wash can greatly help during the difficult parts of transition by removing the extreme overproduction of oils while your scalp heals from the dryness and irritation of dandruff shampoo or sulfate over-use while still looking and feeling presentable. r/curlyhair has an extensive list of good low-poo and co-wash products that will all be suitable for this. There is also an ingredient checker linked in the sidebar there, and another one at [www.isitcg.com](http://www.isitcg.com/) that can help you find products that aren't on their list.\n\nHere's a broad overview of steps that can ease transition.\n\nIf you haven't been using something that will make your transition more intense, you can step into this list at any point that looks comfortable to you.\n\n* Begin with a clarifying wash, as low-poo cannot reliably remove silicones.\n* Choose not to worry about how long this will take, just take each step when it feels comfortable to do so. Part of no-poo is about learning to listen to what your body needs and taking responsibility for your own individual needs.\n\n1. Wash as often as you need with your new product. Add in moisture treatments, healing herbal drenches and scalp massage if needed to deal with dryness and flakes. If you're quitting dandruff shampoo, there will likely be a time of oiliness and flakes that even the low poo won't help with completely. Submerging your hair and gently swishing it around can be very effective at removing them. You will also need lots of moisture during this time, and gentle scalp massage can help lift the flakes and stimulate healing. This step might take several months, because dandruff shampoo or daily sulfate use are both quite damaging and there could be a lot of healing involved.\n2. Start keeping a cup in the shower and use it to dilute your low-poo. Use only as much as you need to get clean. Products are often far too strong, and that’s part of what makes them so stripping.\n3. Start doing water only washes in place of some low-poo washes to learn and practice your new mechanical cleaning skills. Slowly phase out the use of your low-poo.\n4. If you choose to pursue sebum retraining, start spacing your washes out. Wait until you feel you would normally wash, and then wait another day.\n5. Start always doing water only washes. You might need to wash more frequently when you reach this step, and that’s ok. Wash as often as you like. If you want to pursue alternative washing, this is a good time to start experimenting with that also. Don’t be afraid to use your low-poo to help clean up experiments either. During this step, pay attention to the health of your scalp. If you need to clean it a little more, try gently massaging it under the water, just like you’ll be preening under the water.  But it can be delicate, so be gentle when you do. You might also need to add in some moisture treatments as your scalp heals from the low-poo you’ve been using.\n\n* Address any problems that develop, like dealing with hard water waxiness or needing more moisture in your routine.\n\nThis is a simple, methodical approach that will allow you to ease into no-poo while still feeling clean and looking presentable. There is no need for the discomfort of feeling endlessly disgusting, and struggling through that will only make it more likely that you won't make it through transition at all.\n\nYou also don't ever need to worry about doing something that will ruin your transition, it can't happen. Even if you end up with silicone on your hair and have to do a sulfate wash to remove it, you still won't ruin your transition. You have been healing and re-balancing, that is progress that doesn't disappear with one mistake. The only thing you could do to ruin your progress is to go back to full overuse of damaging products again, and even that would take a while.\n\n## Straight to Water Only\n\nThe quickest approach to transition is cold turkey, where you do a final clarifying wash and then just go straight to water only washing once a week. If you haven’t been doing something that will make your transition more intense, you might choose to try this approach, but don’t feel like you are locked into it.  Remember, **any approach to transition that gets you through it is completely valid.** With this approach, transition typically lasts 2-4 months. This is also the most difficult for a variety of reasons.\n\nMost people are not experienced with mechanical cleaning and are learning a whole new skill set. Most people are used to the ease of using shampoo and are not used to the work that mechanical cleaning requires, so often don't perform it properly or sufficiently. Added on top of those is the fact that transition itself is difficult because your scalp is freaking out, your sebum is weird, oil is pouring down like it will never stop, and you're only 'allowed' to wash once a week.\n\nThe only way to deal with this is excessive dry mechanical cleaning every single day, with lots of quality time spent with your boar bristle brush (and then be sure to clean the brush!) **Even if you do this, you will probably still look oily for 2-3 months.** Washing can help, but it's difficult to remove a weeks' worth of oils, especially for people who are just learning how to perform mechanical cleaning in the shower.\n\nScalp health is key in no-poo, but most especially during this approach. All the oils that your scalp is flushing so that it can heal are sitting on your scalp and in your hair all week and can cause a lot of problems if they aren't dealt with. They can create an environment for fungal, yeast or bacterial infections, and under the right circumstances, hair loss. If you have a huge excess of oils on  your scalp, you absolutely must do the gentle scalp massage frequently to keep them moving.\n\nThis approach can be softened and made significantly easier by water only washing more often than just once a week, especially in the beginning. This allows you to practice your in shower mechanical cleaning and will help remove oils, keep your scalp clean and allow you to be more presentable. There are even reports of people who washed every day during their transition and they say they believe it was easier for them because of it. Adding in alternative washing methods when needed can be helpful also, to break up transition wax, or just to remove large quantities of sebum and allow you to have a break from the super oily hair for a few days. Washing more often will extend the retraining aspect of transition, but will make the early part much easier to deal with.\n\nNo-poo is not a short term project, it’s a long term lifestyle choice. It is not a race to see how fast you can finish transition, the ultimate goal is to make it through transition so that you can enjoy your healthy no-poo hair.\n\n## The Two Pieces of Transition\n\nThere are two main things that happen during the time we call transition. There is the time of healing which is the main part of transition, and there is the intentional retraining of sebum production.\n\n## Flushing and Healing\n\nYou have spent years putting things on your scalp that harshly strips your natural oils away, and then put more things on your hair and scalp to try to compensate for this. These things contain many different chemicals that react with you, your environment, and each other in a vast variety of different ways, often causing irritation at the minimum and sometimes serious damage. They have also unbalanced the natural environment of your scalp and hair in serious ways. All of this needs to be corrected and healed, which takes a while and can cause weird things to happen to your scalp and sebum while it works itself out.\n\nThis is a healing time for your scalp. If you have been seriously sick for many years and finally found a treatment that made you better, you would expect it to take a while to heal. Your scalp has the same needs. We aren't talking weeks here, we are talking **months**.\n\nExpectations are powerful. We are trying to supply you with information that is as accurate as possible, so that you can form your expectations based on that. When you see a video on YouTube saying that they did water only for two weeks and showing how awesome their hair is, it's extremely likely their transition hasn't even gotten started yet. Sometimes it can take up to a month or longer for the weirdness to start. But it sets up expectations that transition isn’t such a big deal, which isn't true at all for the vast majority of people.\n\nThere are also people who try no-poo for 4-6 weeks, and then post how horrible it is and how it doesn’t work because their hair is terrible. Even if they have been performing mechanical cleaning properly (many of them haven’t), they are still in transition, and shouldn’t be expecting anything different. But it is probable that they turn a lot of people who were interested in no-poo away from trying it, because ‘it didn’t work for that YouTuber so it’s a scam’.\n\nSome potential milestones during transition, especially if going straight to water only:\n\nAfter the first few washes when your sebum is starting to become weird, you will probably encounter the waxy stage. This is where your hair is stiff, sticky, tangles easily, is difficult to comb or brush and leaves white or grey sticky residue on your tools. This also happens if you have hard water, because it turns oils into ‘wax’. A warm applesauce mask applied for about 30 minutes and then combed out under the shower water can help lift the waxiness. You may have to apply it several times to fully lift the wax. Brushing excessively over the course of several days will also lift it.\n\nThe super oily stage is almost universal, where your hair is saturated with sebum and looks wet and limp and everyone must think you’re a grease monster, but it’s surprisingly soft and easy to comb or brush. Keeping the oil moving with preening and brushing is important so that it doesn’t build up and smell.\n\nYou might encounter the “my wash method is making me lose all my hair” stage where you learn how much hair you actually shed every day but have never noticed.  Shedding about 100 hairs a day is normal, but when you’re using shampoo they usually drift away during the day.  When you go no-poo and your hair is oily, they stick together instead and only come out during a brushing or washing session, so you see them all at once.\n\nAfter a while of trying no-poo and dealing with the overproduction of sebum for weeks on end, you might reach the point where you want to quit because you feel it’s never going to get better, and you’re going to need encouragement to push through.  Find a friend or come post on r/nopoo and share your frustrations, the community is very supportive and encouraging!\n\n## Retraining Sebum Production\n\nOften people have been stripping their hair and scalp with harsh chemicals every day for years. Your scalp compensates by producing a large quantity of sebum, attempting to do its job of protecting and conditioning your hair. It has been trained that this over production needs to happen because of the daily stripping, and so needs to be retrained that it's not going to be harshly stripped any more and can start producing a more balanced amount of sebum. This is done by delaying washes that remove sebum from the scalp in any way, including dry shampoo, allowing your natural biofeedback to realize that there is plenty of sebum on your scalp and eventually it will stop producing so much.\n\nIf you choose to be less intentional about retraining, there are some reports that sebum production will eventually reduce even if you wash with a no-poo method every day. It will just happen at its own pace instead of being encouraged to happen more quickly.",

My response always is \"first and foremost, it's important to know how to shampoo properly so when you do, it counts\".  From how shampoo works to the most common ingredients, I answer all of your shampoo-related questions below. \n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html))\n\n**How does shampoo work?** ​\n\nYou can think of the active ingredient in shampoo as being within [two categories](https://www.nycoproducts.com/resources/blog/simple-science-the-difference-between-soap-and-detergent/): (1) non-detergents (soap) and (2) detergents. Non-detergents are made from natural ingredients and act as an emulsifier for oil and water. This makes it easier to rinse impurities away when it's washed out. Detergents are synthetic, man-made chemicals with active agents (wetting agents) capable of lowering the surface tension of a liquid. These are known as [surfactants](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/), and they do this by having a hydrophilic \"head\" and a hydrophobic \"tail\", which essentially allows the shampoo to stick to oils and dirt in your hair. Those oils and dirt are then swept away when washed out. Another way to understand the difference between non-detergents and detergents: the former will leave a residue behind while the latter will not.[ ](https://www.hairstory.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-detergent/)[Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html) breaks down the purpose of other ingredients you'll find in shampoos to make them effective and pourable (i.e. the opposite of powered shampoos that are becoming more popular). \n\n**How often should I shampoo?**\n\n​Some hair types will need to shampoo daily and others only need to wash once every ten days or so. Preference also plays a role here depending if you're trying to achieve a sleek look or a voluminous one. Shampooing less will condense your hair over time and allow it to hold more oils, which shampooing more will remove oils and promote a fuller look. Think about the following factors as you keep reading through this post, and check out [Post-Workout Hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-post-workout-hair.html) to learn more tips and tricks for managing your hair with a busy life.\n\n*Your hair's density*\n\n* ​*Fine:* Needs to be washed daily, particularly if you have skin that is more oily. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too flat if they try to style it without washing and drying it first. \n* *Thick:* Can be washed anywhere from once every three days to once every ten days. People with this hair type often feel that their hair looks too voluminous or puffy if they wash too frequently. Thick hair also takes longer to blow dry and style, making it a nightmare to wash daily because of the amount of time it adds to your routine. \n\n*Your hair's condition/damage*\n\n* ​*Fine:* If your hair is breaking due to damage you should try to shampoo less - every other day to every three days. Giving your hair a break from washing and styling can help with mitigating damage. Use shampoos and conditioners that are moisturizing, even if they give a flatter look then you like. \n* *Thick:* Damage to thicker hair shows more prominently because there is more of it. Straight hair will often appear to have many flyaways, while on curlier hair damage can be easier to hide. Since your styling routine is already longer because of how much hair you have, avoiding a full wash and blow dry (i.e. heat) for as long as possible can help with mitigating damage. \n\n*The type of shampoo and conditioner you use*\n\n* *Fine:* If you aren't worried about damage, look for a volumizing shampoo and conditioner for day-to-day use. Clarifying shampoos will help strip extra oil from your hair, but should only be used once a week alongside a shampoo made for daily use. Avoid clarifying shampoos if your hair is damaged. \n* *Thick:* Look for moisturizing and hydrating shampoos to counteract your volume. [Co-washes](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/news/a56230/co-washing-benefits/) are also a great option for curlier hair, and can be used more frequently since they are a combination of shampoo and conditioner. They're a great option if you need to wash more because of your workout schedule or job. ​\n\n*Your Scalp*​​\n\nYour scalp is an important part of figuring out how, and how much, to shampoo. This takes trial and error, plus may change over time. Generally, you should wash as often as your scalp can handle it because, like the rest of your skin, it is constantly shedding  cells.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that washing your hair has no effect on the amount of oil produced by your sebaceous glands. This depends on hormonal and genetic factors, and the glands have no way of responding to oils on the surface of your scalp. The theory that you could \"train\" your scalp to be less oily was disproven in 1982 by [Kligman and Shelley](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13525782/).\n\nIf you're trying to avoid washing more frequently, then use a mixed boars bristle brush (BBB) to manipulate the scalp and softly remove cell build up. The Reddit page [No-Poo/Natural Hair](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/) is a good resource for advice on maintaining your scalp when shampooing less frequently. ​\n\n* *Signs you may be washing too much:* a scalp that feels dry or tight\n* *Signs you may not be washing enough:* ​excessive product/oil build up​\n\n**What is the proper way to shampoo?** \n\nTo help the shampoo work, emulsify it in your hands before applying. Start applying in at the back of your head, ending at the crown. Take around a minute to apply it. Similar to washing your hands, shampoo takes a few seconds to lift the oils and dirt.\n\n* *When you're looking for volume:* Pay attention to the sides and back of your head when shampooing and rinsing, as these areas are commonly missed. For thicker hair, consider washing (or rinsing) in two sections. If you've gone 3+ days without washing, shampooing twice also makes sense.\n* *When you're looking to smooth/leave natural oils behind:* Generally, use a minimal amount of shampoo and rinse it out fairly quickly. Try conditioning your hair first, then shampooing and conditioning again. See the \"volume\" bullet above if you feel like you need a deep clean. This is helpful but not always necessary.\n\n**Shampoo Ingredients**\n\nMany people search for shampoo via the phrase \"shampoo without chemicals\". Technically, if the shampoo has water in it this will count as a chemical, so a better approach is to search for shampoos via ingredients. I've given you a list to consider below. \n\n*Shampoo Without Silicone*\n\nSoluble silicone formulas can be washed out with gentler shampoos and conditioners that don't contain surfactants, and are capable of achieving the same results as non-soluble silicones. Common names on the bottle include:\n\n* *Non-solu​ble:* Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Amodimethicone, Pheryl trimethicone, Ceteraryl methicone, Dimethiconol, Stearyl dimethicone, Amodimethicone (non-soluble when Trideceth-12 and Cetrimonium Chloride are absent)\n* ​*Soluble:* Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone copolyol, Lauryl methicone copolyol, any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n\n*​Shampoo Without Sulfate and SLS*\n\nAs a rule of thumb, ingredients like Ammonium lauryl sulfate and Ammonium laureth sulfate tend to be easier on sensitive scalps than Sodium lauryl sulfate. To learn more about surfactants, check out [Simplifying Hair Products II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-simplifying-hair-products-ii.html). \n\n*Shampoo Without Parabens*​\n\nMost water based shampoos contain preservatives because without them they  will eventually grow mold or bacteria. Parabens are a type of preservative that are commonly used in hair products. According to The FDA \"scientists continue to review published studies on the safety of parabens. At this time, we do not have information showing that parabens, as they are used in cosmetics, have an effect on human health\" (Source: [FDA, Parabens in Cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/parabens-cosmetics)). They're usually easy to spot on the bottle because they end in the word \"paraben\". Common non-paraben preservatives are shown in the list below. To learn more about parabens, check out this article published by Cosmopolitan: [Wait, What Actually Are Parabens and Should You Avoid Them? ](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n* [*Common names on the bottle:* Midazolidinyl urea, Iodopropynyl, Isothiazolinone, and Sodium benzoate](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a28662211/what-are-parabens/)\n\n*Shampoo Without Salt*\n\n[Sodium chloride](https://nutrafol.com/blog/15-shampoo-ingredients-to-avoid/) is another name for salt. It's used in shampoo and conditioner mainly to make the consistency thicker. A trend of \"salt shampoos\" has also been seen, where the benefits include being used as a [scrub](https://www.byrdie.com/what-are-salt-shampoos) for the scalp, plus being gentler on the environment. This has may have been influenced by the idea of adding [salt or sea water ](https://www.gourmandize.com/article-6582-put-salt-in-your-shampoo-to-solve-your-worst-hair-problems.htm)to your current shampoo. I wouldn't recommend adding sea water to your shampoo, as this could potentially generate bacteria and mold in your products over time. \n\n**Shampoo/Ingredients For Hair Care Concerns**\n\n*Hair Loss*\n\nFor assisting with hair loss, there are DHT-blocking shampoos plus ones with ingredients that help with inflammation. Saw palmetto, also known as [Serenoa](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/039463201202500435), naturally lowers the conversion of testosterone into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a sex hormone that contributes to human developments such as body hair, but it can also make you lose your hair faster and earlier. If you're experiencing any type of hair loss, the first place to start is with a doctor. You don't want to try different shampoos only to later find out a doctor would have pointed you in a different direction. \n\n*Hair Growth*\n\nShampoos with biotin are frequently marketed as being helpful for hair growth. It is also commonly added to shampoos claiming to reduce hair loss, but there is no [evidence](https://www.webmd.com/connect-to-care/hair-loss/does-biotin-really-prevent-hair-loss) that it prevents this. Consuming foods rich in healthy vitamins and minerals will help with overall hair health.\n\n*Dry Scalp*\n\nSome contributing factors to a dry or itchy scalp can't be solved with a shampoo. However, certain ingredients can offer relief.\n\n* ​​*Salicylic acid:* This can be found in drug store shampoos advertising scalp health. It will help remove scalp cells causing dandruff while also moisturizing dry spots. Consider using it seasonally during dry winter months, or on a regular basis as needed. \n* *Selenium sulfide:* Formulated to control more serious dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. It's also used to treat pityriasis versicolour, a common fungal infection that causes small patches of skin to become scaly and discoloured.\n* *Ketoconazole:* An ingredient that provides the same benefits as Selenium sulfide.\n* *Tea Tree Oil:* [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360273/) have shown that tea tree oil effectively fights many types of bacteria, viruses and fungi. These shampoos tend to be very calming and cleansing.\n\n*Naturally Grey Hair Turning Yellow* \n\nUse two types of shampoo: (1) a purple shampoo and (2) a moisturizing shampoo. Grey hair tends to pick up unwanted yellow tones from the environment, and purple shampoo will help combat these tones. The moisturizing shampoo helps prevent your hair from becoming too dry, which can be exacerbated by purple shampoo. Check out [Purple Shampoo](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-purple-shampoo.html) for more insight on your options for these products. ",

I get really confused on this topic because I know they say not to use SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) or SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate) to minimize color fading, but I see that a lot of hair ingredients list things that sound very similar to these ingredients such as: sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate and sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, both of which are found in the ouai detox shampoo. Those ingredients are just an example, but basically like anytime I see any of the terms Sodium, Lauryl/Laureth, Sulfate, or anything that ends with -ate, on their own or in conjuction with something else in hair ingredients, I am scared that means the ingredient/product isn't color safe and will ruin my hair.

It's a bit more complicated than just identifying one ingredient.  But ultimately, water itself will make your hair fade more than most shampoos, so the best way to minimize color fading while washing the hair is to minimize the number of rinses.  This could be done by using a moisturizing shampoo or co-wash, and then skipping the rinse-out conditioner and only using a leave-in.  Decreasing the frequency of washing will help as well, but that might lead to more scalp issues, so keep an eye on that if you're prone to dandruff or other scalp issues.\n\nAlso keep in mind that UV rays from the sun are also quite damaging and contribute to color fading, so protect the hair from sunlight as well.",

It is a work in progress. Please feel free to post corrections and additional information so we can have a resource that is beneficial and helpful to those who need it!\n\n**The biggest recommendation: Shower Filter**\n\nIf you're having skin problems, perhaps one of the best and easiest things you can do is get a shower head filter.  They are relatively inexpensive and are threaded to attach to your existing shower plumbing, so will fit almost anywhere. A decent filter will remove many contaminants that your skin is reacting to like heavy metals, silt and other particulates, other chemicals and residues. Chlorine is great for delivering clean water to populations, but not so awesome for skin. It is drying and irritating and often removing it can have dramatic effects if you are struggling with chronically unhappy skin.\n\n## Flakes and Scalp Conditions\n\nFirst off, none of us here are doctors, so if you have a serious condition and nothing here helps, then you need to go see one and get some professional help.\n\nOur bodies are amazing ecosystems that have functions in place to keep us healthy. One of them is the acidic lipid barrier (oily sebum) that our skin produces. The mild acidity of healthy skin that is coated in sebum helps kill pathogens and support an environment for our symbiotic microflora to thrive and out compete the pathogens that can survive. When that sebum is chronically removed by harsh detergents, problems start to arise. Our symbiotic microflora dies off and the only thing that can survive is the unwanted pathogens. Our skin has lost its protection that helps seal in moisture and can dry out, causing damage like cracks and dead layers of cells that couldn't survive the dry environment. It doesn't help that the 2 most common types of detergent surfactants in body products, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are known skin irritants and only exacerbate the damage the dryness is already causing.  All of this can accumulate and cause skin to become dry, chapped, cracked and even get so bad that bleeding and infection occur.\n\nManufacturers know this and try to mitigate it by adding in moisturizers like aloe and glycerine and sealers like oils and silicone, but the cause of the damage never goes away. Shampoo also dissolves and suppresses the flakes that are dry, dead skin cells.\n\n## Small white flakes, like snow = dry scalp/skin\n\nThe result of all of this is that flaky dry scalp are quite common when beginning natural no-poo.  The shampoo that suppresses the damage that is already there is no longer being used, and it finally is able to be expressed. The good news is that it will be temporary until the scalp heals.\n\nRemoving the causes of the dryness is the first priority. If you are no longer using product, that's a great first step.  Even choosing to use a low-poo or a conditioner meant for co-washing will help the irritation caused by the harsh sulfates heal.\n\nGentle scalp massage for 5-30 minutes every day will help warm and stimulate circulation in your scalp, allowing more nourishing blood to the damaged skin so that it can heal. Use the pads of your fingers in back and forth motions all over your scalp. Try not to use circular motions as that can tangle and pull hair out.\n\nHot water is very drying. It opens all your pores and the moisture and sebum stored in them are rinsed away, leaving the skin dry and without it's protective oil until more can be produced. It is better to use warm or cool water when you are trying to heal dry skin.\n\nMoisture treatments will help the skin heal by finally giving it the moisture it needs. There are many, many natural options that can help moisturize both skin and hair. Do some research and experimentation to find one that works well for your situation. Here is a thread with lots of information on various moisture treatments.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/mtp0wc/tell\\_me\\_aboutmoisturizing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/mtp0wc/tell_me_aboutmoisturizing/)\n\nHere are some popular options that help a lot of people.\n\nAloe - juice from the digestive aid section of a pharmacy with 3 ingredients or less or store bought gel that has no drying alcohols or gel directly from the plant. To prepare fresh aloe juice, cut the leaf off the plant as close to the body of the plant that you can. Set the leaf cut side down in a container for a while to allow it to drain. Discard the drained liquid and rinse the leaf off. Slice it open and scoop the insides into a blender. Add enough water to blend smoothly, and then blend until smooth. Strain the solids out and refrigerate. Use within 3-4 days, or freeze in portions and use as needed.\n\nCoconut water - the liquid that is inside a coconut. It can often be found with sports drinks, or bottled water. Use the kind that is a single ingredient with nothing added.\n\nCoconut milk - canned, single ingredient, fat removed or homemade. Take fresh or dried, unsweetened coconut flakes and put 1 cup into a blender. Add 3-4 cups hot but not boiling water and blend until creamy. Strain out the solids and refrigerate. Remove the fat that has solidified on the top and use the milk within 3-4 days or freeze in portions and use as needed.\n\nHoney - 1 teaspoon (5 ml) in 1 cup water (250 ml). Wet your hair and pour the honey mixture in sections over your scalp, catching it and massaging it into each section. Once it is all applied, gently massage all over your scalp in back and forth motions. Circular motions can catch and pull hair. Allow to sit for 5-10 minutes, then rinse out. Honey is a humectant, meaning it draws moisture to itself. If the air is dry, it will draw moisture out from the lower layers of your skin, so it should always be used with water to give it moisture to bind to. Not every type of hair likes honey, and not every type of honey is good for hair. Raw unfiltered honey can have unfiltered beeswax still in it and it can leave an odd, not quite greasy coating on the hair. If honey is doing this to you, try a different kind. If it persists, your hair just might not like it.\n\nMoisture Treatment for hair and scalp:\n\nDilute aloe juice or coconut water by half, apply til dripping (I use a spray bottle), gently massage into scalp for a few minutes, scrunch into your hair if you have enough hair to do so, then wrap in a towel for at least an hour before rinsing it out. Do this as often as you like. If you have low porosity hair or very dry hair, gentle heat can help this absorb better. Throw a heavy towel in the dryer before you apply the treatment, then use it to wrap your head and hair. If it starts cooling, heat another towel and swap them out. There are also various heated caps available that can be more convenient.\n\nHerbal infusions can also help soothe and heal your scalp. There is a list of herbs that are good for hair here.\n\n[https://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com/blog/posts/herbs-for-hair-care/](https://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com/blog/posts/herbs-for-hair-care/)\n\nYou can read the list and see what might be helpful for your situation. Rosemary and/or Lavender are always good choices for soothing and healing infusions. Marshmallow root is also moisturizing and soothing. A guide for making infusions is below.\n\n## Larger, yellowish flakes, usually accompanied with other symptoms = Fungal infection/dandruff\n\nIf you have larger, yellowish flakes, you probably have a fungal infection. No-poo does have treatments for this that can be very effective, or you can use main stream treatments and return to no-poo once the issue has cleared up. Refer to the section of the guide on transition to understand how this might affect your scalp and issues it might cause.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar, organic with the mother (ACV, Apple Vinegar) - When using vinegar for mitigating the effects of hard water or as an acidic rinse after an alkaline wash, any type will work. When needing it for medicinal purposes, live unfiltered ACV is far more effective. It is a good anti-fungal and can help treat many skin conditions. For fungal infections start with a standard 1:16 dilution which is 1 tablespoon (15 ml) in 1 cup water (250 ml). Apply it as a leave on treatment at the end of your wash, gently massage it in and allow it to dry. If it doesn’t seem to be soothing or helping, slowly increase the concentration up to a 1:1 dilution. The stronger it is, the more potential for damage to your hair, but a healthy scalp can regrow healthy hair.\n\nThere are also some effective herbal treatments. Black Walnut, Calendula and Cloves are all strong anti-fungal herbs. Cloves can be irritating though, so use with awareness. You can make an infusion with them and use it to either dilute your ACV or by itself. A guide for making infusions is below.\n\n## Eczema, Psoriasis, Seborrheic Dermatitis, etc\n\nThere are many people who want to try no-poo to see if it will help their chronic skin conditions, and many people have found relief. There are others who unfortunately haven’t. But those who found relief have given reports of things that have helped them. Here are a few of the most common.\n\nRaw, unfiltered, living vinegar is very effective at helping skin condition breakouts. This vinegar can be in a variety of forms, but Apple Cider Vinegar, Organic with the Mother is the most readily available. Other people use kombucha vinegar from brewing their own kombucha or coconut vinegar, or wine vinegar, but it must be living. It can be applied undiluted to skin, but should be diluted for use on hair if you are trying to not damage it. The standard dilution is 1 tablespoon (15ml) in 1 cup water (250ml). You can slowly increase it up to a 1:1 ratio, but understand that the stronger it is, the greater risk of damaging your hair, but a healthy scalp can regrow healthy hair.\n\nPeople find high mineral salt rinses to be effective at treating breakouts also, especially SD. Salt like Himalayan, Dead Sea, high mineral sea salt like Redmonds are all reported to be extremely good at helping to heal breakouts in a short amount of time. Start with 1 teaspoon (5ml) in 1 cup (250ml) water and increase gradually until you find a concentration that helps. Be aware that salt is drying, so you might need to do some moisturizing after treatment is finished.\n\nThere are a very few companies that are producing skin probiotics that aren’t gimmicks. Mother Dirt is the main one, and there are a few others whose products can be found occasionally. Mother Dirt’s parent company is using the proceeds from their AO+ Mist and other products to fund real scientific research into using these types of microflora to treat eczema specifically, with plans to branch out into other conditions later. Many people have reported extremely favorable results from using AO+ Mist on their skin. There are also reviews on Amazon for the other skin probiotic sprays that report excellent results.\n\n## Herbal Infusions\n\nInfusions are different than teas. They are stronger and take longer to make. The process also allows a greater spectrum of the nutrients in the plant to be transferred to the water, including the essential oils inherent in it. It is a mostly cold process so that the delicate nutrients won’t be destroyed by heat.\n\nIt doesn’t require a large amount of herbs to make an infusion. A total volume of a tablespoon (15 ml)or two of dried herbs will make a nice strong infusion. Put the dried herbs into a pot with a lid or a jar with a lid. Stainless steel or glass is preferred as herbs can react with things and those are mostly non-reactive. Add 2 cups (500ml) of water to the pot and bring to a boil then immediately turn off the heat, or pour boiling water into the jar. Put the lid on whichever you used, then allow to sit for 8-12 hours at room temperature. Strain and use either to dilute other treatments or by itself either as a treatment or as a leave on finishing rinse. If you don’t use it immediately, it can be refrigerated for several days.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFeel free to post comments, questions or clarifications.

Also I have to go down to one mouthwash per brushing as 3 mouthwashes twice a day is absolutely wrecking havoc on my mouth and I think worsening the sensitivity. I will report back if this solves the problem. \n\nAlso the concept of using a different toothbrush night and day and disonfecting and letting dry before the next use 24 hours later is something that makes total sense. \n\nAlso I’m finding that xylitol crystals are easier on the mouth than mints.

I’ve spent tens of thousands of dollars on dental work and also all these fancy toothbrushes and toothpastes etc. but I have NEVER seen such quick changes as I’ve seen when I saw her viral video the other week and gave it a try. \n\nAlready my bad perio breath alone has been completely wiped out after a week. I mean that alone is worth the price of admission for life as far as I’m concerned. It gets rid of raw onion breath instantly too. I never heard of this Closys product before. And her system is described for FREE on her YouTube videos and she is not affiliated with any of the companies other than her own Zellies mints which I am trying to buy on her store. The Cherry Berry is always sold out tho.\n\nThe cheap crest toothpaste she recommends (have to get that exact one) is way more effective than the Tom’s or Sensodyne one I was using. I still have sensitivity issues and I’m dealing with that by adding Mi Paste or the GC Tooth Mousse, after the fluoride rinse. Hope not to need it after a while. I do not think the sainsbury toothpaste is a good substitute for the Crest. Crest has trisodium phosphate and Sains doesn’t.  I wish she would explain WHY that particular toothpaste but maybe she does in her book, I dunno.\n\nDr Ellie says the most crucial part is the xylitol but I feel like all the components are crucial. \n\nHer videos also provide further details on what periodontitis is and how it progresses, how to avoid. She said something about bacteria on toothbrushes that made total sense to me and why she dries them out between uses. I am now spraying my toothbrushes with Listerine after every use on top of drying them. I can’t bring myself to toss toothbrushes after travel but I’m definitely disinfecting them with listerine now.",

Thank you to everyone who posts here!\n\nSkin details: oily/combo skin, bengaluru, teenage\n\nHair details: 2a/2b/2c (mostly 2b), dry scalp in winters, wavy, low porosity I think, kinda virgin (except the times I hair-dried my hair like twice in an year or when until half an year ago I would occasionally fail to regulate the shower heat properly and put really hot water on my hair lol)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Cleansing oil:**\n\n***Johnson’s Baby Oil*** (not in pic coz in the bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: past few weeks on and off*\n\nNon-emulsifying fragranced mineral oil. I wanted to oil cleanse since my skin felt congested and this was the cheapest option; I got 50ml for 62rs. Fragrance did not irritate me (smell wise wasn’t irritating too). Idk how it works on removing stuff since I am not using sunscreen yet. Skin felt soft and clearer after using. Wiped with a tissue before moving on to cleanser.\n\nNo issues/5. WRP\n\n**Cleanser:**\n\n***Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash*** (not in pic coz I do not have it anymore):\n\n*Usage Period: 2 years until a few months ago*\n\nUsed a long time ago. Helped me alot initially when I was trying to fix my skin (this is obviously better than using body wash/soap).\n\n2.5/5 since I noticed my pimples decreased when I switched to the next cleanser on the list. WNRP\n\n***Simple Refreshing Facial Wash*** (have my backup bottle in the pic; one I am using right now is in the bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: an year i think*\n\nA GAME CHANGER in my routine. I used to switch b/w creams and serums wondering where I was going wrong, but ignored the cleansing part. Acne-proneness reduced significantly once I started using it. Never leaves skin stripped even in summer. Affordable. Removes sweat and dirt well. It's all you could ask from a cleanser.\n\nHG\n\n**Toner:**\n\n***TONYMOLY WONDER Ceramide Mochi Toner:***\n\n*Usage Period: Past few weeks regularly*\n\nYes I did buy this during the recent nykaa sale. I was looking for toners within budget but seeing u got to pay 300-500 rs for 100-150 ml, I decided to buy this based on reviews. I just wish I had read the ingredient list before, coz it has macadamia oil (trying to avoid oils since my skin gets oily). I honestly dk what to feel about this toner. It cannot be used on its own for sure, since my skin starts making more oil. Layered with other products however, it does a nice job, in fact it made my skin SUPER SOFT so ig it satisfies what it claims to do. It gives that dewy look to skin (which could get oily but tbh I am bad at figuring out the difference). But for the quantity and ingredients you get (excluding the macadamia, rosewood, lemon peel oils and added fragrance like limonene and all), it is a really nice toner. If you use only one layer (don't try layering it unless u have really dry skin coz it gets sticky, no 7skin technique with this one which is a shame considering the quantity), then it is pretty nice. Using both in the AM and PM. No breakouts caused. Secure packaging.\n\n3.75/5, Maybe Repurchase (another toner from the same WONDER range might suit oily skin ppl more) (i think ill buy smthn else totally next time) (pls drop reccs for economic toners)\n\n**Serum:**\n\n***DermaCo 2% Salicylic Acid Serum*** (not in pic coz empty in the bin):\n\n*Usage Period: An year or two on and off*\n\nFirst serum I ever used. Really helped me decrease my pimples, but considering I used it with a body moisturizer (vaseline ice cream) or no moisturizer at all back then, that too inconsistently, I do not think it was able to do its job properly hehe. Lightweight. The earlier dropper sucked but the second one was pretty good. Emptied 2 bottles. Has a weird smell at first which fades away after a couple weeks (my suggestion: do not put it directly under ur nose (moustache area) during that period).\n\n3.5/5 WRP\n\n***Pilgrim Oil Control Salicylic acid and Niacinamide Serum:***\n\n*Usage Period: Since a few months ago on and off, regularly for the past few weeks*\n\nI bought this when dermaco ran out and this was on sale (despite the gimmicky k-beauty marketing, but now I realize it is just their company's theme to focus on different locations for different lines). 4% niacinamide and 2% salicylic acid in this one. It does help soothe pimples and prevent them, but this is wayy more oily and tacky than the dermaco one. Dermaco had just witch hazel while this has green tea, neem, willow bark, aloe vera, tea tree, etc. in the formulation, which must explain the oiliness, but no problem using it in the PM. Other than that pretty good serum. This has a herbal scent which does not go away with time; idk what tea tree oil smells like but I imagine it to be like this, but it is not a very bad smell (imo). Normal dropper packaging.\n\n3.51/5 WRP\n\n**Aloe Vera Gel** (putting this here coz now I use aloe vera gel at the essence stage):\n\n***Patanjali Aloe Vera Gel:***\n\n*Usage Period: once*\n\nBought this in a hurry for 60rs coz I had just waxed and the local aloe vera gel (colored and fragranced but didn’t irritate but idk which brand) I had used last time which was lying around in the house had expired. You would use aloe vera gel for soothing irritated areas, but I put this heavily colored and fragranced sh1t on my body and face AND IT BURNED. So no. ABSOLUTELY NEVER AGAIN (it is half empty coz I ended up using some for a hair experiment and idk how it went)\n\n0/5 HOLY FAIL\n\n***Innisfree Aloe Revital Soothing Gel:***\n\n*Usage Period: Regularly for the past few weeks*\n\nGot this for B1G1 at rs475 during nykaa pink summer sale (steal imo). Colorless clear gel. Has a faint chemical smell which is not even noticeable unless u try really hard (common in non-fragranced products methinks). Some ppl on the internet say it has very little aloe in it, while I read somewhere that Innisfree confirmed to a customer that ingredient lists work differently in Korea than in other parts of the world and their gel has got 93% aloe, but idk. Really soothing. I was using it at the essence stage simply coz heyy I have 600ml of aloe vera gel might as well use it, but this morning I had what i call reyHasIrritatedSkinForNoRealReasonOnlyInMornings without even putting a single product on my skin and even after my usual moisturizer, something that was pretty common for me in the daytime (hormones? Hard water? No sunscreen? The possible reasons are plenty), but this gel is really helpful for it. It feels like it does not do anything but I cant got without it now. Obviously cannot be used as a standalone moisturizer. Will use it the next time I get a wax, if I have not come back here to update just assume that it worked really well. No complaints. Easily spreadable. Tube came sealed, small nozzle which is really convenient and I get only the amount of the product I need.\n\n4.75/5 WRP/HG\n\n**Moisturizer:**\n\n***Dr. Sheth’s Ceramide and Vitamin C oil free moisturizer:***\n\n*Usage Period: few months on and off*\n\nFirst moisturizer I bought a couple of months back instead of just using whatever random cream my mom bought. 50g for 300 something rs (it is 327 right now on amazon and i think 279 on flipkart). Usual tube packaging. Ashwagandha smell (coz it has ashwagandha). And it has to be one of the best moisturizers. EVER. It just sank into my skin, didn't feel like anything was on, but really moisturized very well, I could tell my skin did not like going without it. Later with the ceramide mochi toner ISTG THE SOFTNESS? It has 1% vitc. I think my face glowed a little bit (or was it just finally getting into a consistent routine?) Did sometimes feel like it made my skin too stuffy/moisturized tho (it says it has coconut alkanes, which ik is not the same as coconut oil so it is not comedogenic, but idk). Did not break me out. I finished the tube, and I have never finished any moisturizer in my life. Highly recommend as long as ur not sensitive to any of the ingredients.\n\n4.5/5 WRP\n\n***Dot and Key Cica and Niacinamide oil free moisturizer:***\n\n*Usage Period: twice yesterday (am and pm)*\n\nGot the 50g tube delivered this morning and used it. 5% niacinamide and centella in this one. I bought htis coz i thought i did not need vitc and niacinamide better targets my skin concerns. 5% niacinamide serums are pricey (10% is too strong i fear even if i wanna try the 15ml 300smthn rs plum one), and I wanted to get smthn centella (my toner has it but still) so i bought this one, seeing it had really similar ingredients (same ceramides and all) to the dr.sheth’s one, and is literally almost the same price for 50ml. Ik i have not used this long enough, just once, but I can tell you it is REALLY STICKY. So sticky I put a tissue paper on my cheek and it STUCK. It also smells like glue/paint/i dont remember what but it is really familiar. It formed this film on my skin which was light and subtle and did not look bad, but it did not sink in like the dr.sheth’s one (have they increased my standards?). I looked at the ingredients and thought it must be the dimethicone, but even dr.sheth’s has dimethicone. I am not an ingredient/chemistry person (not even a science student lol), but the whatever makes a moisturizer sticky or layery/ silicones are really siliconing in this one. Kinda soothing to wear (not soothing enough to calm down my morning irritation, I needed to use innisfree aloe for that). Feels like it's pulling my face taut. But now I gotta finish this before buying another product. It does not seem like it is breaking me out or clogging my pores \\*yet\\*, but if it does not, ill just use it till it gets over.\n\nHave not used enough to rate, but first impression 2.0/5\n\nOKAY here is my 2nd impression; it is not that bad. I just realised I was using it the same way I used the dr.sheth’s moisturizer, which is cream/gel like and is easily spreadable. This is also cream/gel like but more solid? I read the instructions and it asked to be dotted and then spread in upward motions. I ended up doing it and realised maybe I am also using more quantity, so I swiped some off. And it worked pretty well (and is not that sticky)! Still doesn't leave a silky smooth finish like the dr sheth’s one, but I think this is decent. I woke up this morning and usually every morning if I do not cleanse my face within 30 mins to 1 hour of waking up it would feel really irritated as though it were saying “gEt ThIs GuNk OfF mE”, but it did not feel like that today! I’ll take that as a win. Second impression 3.25/5\n\nEDIT: 3rd impression: No. I was just trying to gaslight myself into thinking it is okay it makes skin look really oily. Will use it till it gets over as long as I am not going out anywhere. 2.5/5\n\n***NIVEA Soft*** (no pic coz with mom):\n\n*Usage Period: very rarely here and there*\n\nThis is my mom’s absolute HG moisturizer. Back when I was younger and had parched dry absolutely-not-taken-care-of skin in the winter, she suggested it to me too. So I put it on but it had a really burning sensation. My mom said it was probably coz of extreme dryness, and that had made sense coz I would feel the same sensation on my dryy legs when I put a different lotion. Fast forward a couple years and when dr.sheth’s got over and I was still deciding which moisturizer to buy next, I took some of this for a night. And it still BURNED! After a layer of toner, serum, and aloe vera gel! I had been pretty diligent with moisturizing so WHY? Then I checked the ingredients list and found \\*drumroll\\* *alcohol.* So ig my skin does not like alcohol. You might like it if it suits you. I can finally stop dreaming about someday getting one of those lightweight japanese alcohol sunscreens like skin aqua or nivea super water gel (I am happy for my wallet but sad in general). On top of that it became quite oily like I had literally put oil on my skin (it does have jojoba oil).\n\nI do not think I am eligible to rate this/5.\n\n**Lip balms:**\n\n***SUGAR lip balm*** (05 Irish Coffee):\n\n*Usage Period: Past few months regularly*\n\nMy mom gave this to me since she did not really use it and ig it is okay. Obviously better than nothing on lips at all. Using this right now. Convenient typical twist lip balm packaging. No color. 3/5.\n\n***Himalaya Cocoa butter lip balm***(not in pic coz i chucked it):\n\n*Usage Period: Almost 6 months*\n\nThis is just outright bad, sits on ur lips and does nothing. No color. 1/5. WNRP\n\n***McCaffiene Coffee Lip Balm*** (not in pic coz it is with my mom):\n\n*Usage Period: once*\n\nI used it only once coz this one is also my mom’s and it healed my lips and made them so soft? I was really surprised. I think it is pricey tho for the amount u get (but lip balms in general are pretty pricey)Still tryna steal it from her hehe. Not used long enough to review, but 4/5. No color.\n\n**Sunscreens:**\n\n***Lacto Calamine Lacto Calamine Sunshield Matte Look Sunscreen SPF50 PA+++***(not in pic coz in the bin):\n\n*Usage Period: Twice or thrice*\n\nImmense white cast that goes away (kinda) with a lot of rubbing. Really tacky feeling. Would never wanna reapply. No. 2/5. WNRP (idek about the protection)\n\n***Satthwa SPF 50 PA+++ water based sunscreen***(not in pic coz in the bin):\n\n*Usage Period: Twice or thrice*\n\nGot this coz good reviews on amazon and 100g for the usual price of 50g. First red flag shoulda been this came in a transparent tube which was wrapped in packaging sticker (that was uncovered in the top and bottom area) like as tho this was not a sunscreen lol. Yeah no white cast as the reviews said but made my skin greasy and disgusting as hell. Broke me out in small pimples. My poor self did not even know that I needed oil/micellar water to remove sunscreen so I did not even clean it properly and it hurt my face :( 0/5. HF\n\nAll the sunscreens I wanna buy seem expensive :( I am not using any right now since I am mostly indoors for the holidays and natural light in the new house we moved to is really low, but ik i need to figure this out before college starts in mid july. I also hate siliconey/layery sunscreens (I did post asking for help don't worry I got good replies , you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/12x40lq/non_silicone_pharma_sunscreen_reccs_please/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) ). Right now deciding b/w Aurelderma UV edge spf 50 pa+++ but idk if it is photostable (Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Benzophenone-3, Avobenzone combo) and Eunyul Dailycare Fresh Sunscreen Spf 46 pa+++ (nice ingredients, new gen photostable filters, 1500 rs for 300ml on amazon so 250rs for 50g which is cheap but I spend my own savings money for skincare/haircare other than cleanser and shampoo and I’ll have to break the bank for this (I have already spent recklessly on skincare and pre-ordering a kpop album) and also if it does not suit me I’ll end up with 300ml of product I will not use/ will hate using so idk). I hope to figure it out by next month (praying I will not go broke) coz I have hyperpigmentation issues and healing acne scars which might be worsened by sun damage and also I do not want old me complaining coz I am not using sunscreen now lol.\n\n**Hair Oils:**\n\n***Bajaj Almond Drops:***\n\n*Usage Period: All my life i think*\n\n79% mustard oil and 21% sweet almond oil which my mom buys. Nice. Not really willing to buy any oil myself so this does the job for dry detangling. Helps my scalp not get too dry since I use a cleansing shampoo every wash. Idk about hair growth and stuff (I do not think it helps). 4/5 for my use.\n\n**Shampoo:**\n\n***Ayur Coconut Shampoo*** (not in pic coz in bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: All my life till I think 8 months back*\n\nMy mom still swears by this. I have used it most my life. And considering it is just some gel base, coconut oil (which is comedogenic), and 20% sodium laureth sulfate, ig it is not a surprise that when I switched from this, my hairfall INSTANTLY decreased by almost less than half. No thank you. 0/5 ew\n\n***XHC Argan oil Shampoo*** (not in pic coz in bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: 8 - 12 months (till now)*\n\nUse this right now. My uncle initially bought it and I happened to use it, and my hair was immediately less dry and fell less. Idk if this is due to this being good or my ex-shampoo being bad tho. Cleans decent. 3/5 WRP\n\n**Conditioner:**\n\n***Himalaya Dryness Defense Detangler & Conditioner - Hibiscus & Blue Water Lily*** (not in pic coz over):\n\n*Usage Period: Do not remember exactly how long, but finished the bottle (the small one)*\n\nFirst conditioner, best in the drugstore ones i have tried. Does the job. Silicone based. 3/5. Looking for smthn better\n\nI’d also used a ***dove nutritive solutions conditioner*** but i dont remember the variant. But it was not nice i would say. 2/5 WNRP\n\n***Kesh King Conditioner*** (not in pic coz in bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: 3-4 times*\n\nMost recently used conditioner. Big no. Just dries ur hair. 1/5 WNRP\n\nJust bought True Frog’s everyday conditioner (finally pursuing a wavy hair routine? maybe but idk considering the money I have), might review after a couple of uses.\n\n**Hair Gel:**\n\n***Set Wet yellow color:***\n\n*Usage Period: 3-4 times*\n\nNice hold but very strong nauseating men’s perfume/ a car’s inside in really hot weather smell that I do not want in my hair. 2/5 WNRP\n\nChoosing b/w FMC flaxseed gelly or true frog’s styling gel. I also need to buy a leave in conditioner (tho I might just use regular conditioner as a leave in lol)(choosing b/w true frog’s leave in or styling cream (the cream has more protein and ig my hair is okay with protein but it is not really damaged and i do not want to protein overload it). This is obviously gonna be months later IF i get birthday money from relatives.\n\n*Bonus*: Toothpaste is not skincare but Paradontax is my HG. Life changing. Never going back to colgate again. Cleans plaque and have not had bad breath problems (i did get my teeth cleaned last october)(idk who needs to hear this but GUMS BLEEDING IS NOT NORMAL even if ur parent with gum problems themselves tries to gaslight u into thinking it is (my gums were on the verge of crisis)) I also use a 2+ colgate toothbrush instead of a regular one. It is softer and smaller so I focus on brushing each side and part of my teeth more properly.\n\n*Extra* tip which I already commented on someone else’s post, do not use ur regular towel to wipe ur face, air dry it or use a fresh tissue. Also change ur pillowcovers regularly. Also drink plenty of water (I say while drinking only 500-1000 ml of water in a day).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd THAT is almost everything I have ever used. Now that I have let out all this stuff here, I hope my brain will stop running that imaginary youtube channel of me reviewing my skincare and stuff as I do it. Wish me luck for figuring out sunscreen and haircare (and also bodycare which I do not even have a routine for yet, I just use whatever bodywash my family buys (i hate my body skin feeling greasy or sticky any time of the year coz this is india) (my keratosis pilaris cries in agony), pls drop reccs).\n\nThank you for reading this longgg post (or atleast parts of it) with the worst grammar and thought flow known to humankind! (and the most unnecessary details in brackets) Here is to everyone in this subreddit finding their HG’s while not going broke! Until next time! (if there is a next time that is)\n\nwow this is 6 pages in google docs arial size 11 what have i done\n\nI added a review and a second impression and usage periods and it is 7 pages now hehe",

(found: http://intothegloss.com/2015/01/best-drugstore-face-wash/)\n\nSo, this is just because I think it's interesting and I'm sure some may disagree with what she put on the list (like, SLS is on the \"good\" side) - but I think it's interesting and good to have some INCI names for things that might irritate the skin. So here goes, and sorry bc it's a long one: \n\n*the alcohols to be concerned about in skin-care products are \n\nethanol, \n\ndenatured alcohol, \n\nethyl alcohol, \n\nmethanol, \n\nisopropyl alcohol, \n\nSD alcohol, and \n\nbenzyl alcohol (when it’s among the main ingredients; tiny amounts aren't a problem). \n\nthese types can be extremely drying and irritating to skin, as well as capable of generating free radical damage and disrupting skin's protective barrier.\n\nsome companies use cleansing agents (a type of ingredient) that can be so drying and irritating. the biggest culprits to avoid in a face wash are:\n\nsodium palm kernelate,\n\npotassium hydroxide,\n\nsodium hydroxide\n\nsodium cocoate\n\nsodium lauryl sulfate\n\nTEA-lauryl sulfate\n\nsodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate\n\nsodium palmate\n\nthere are so many good cleansing agents, too many to list, but heres some common ones that are good to see in your first few ingredients…\n\nlaurie acid\n\npalmitic acid\n\nisohexadecane\n\nammonium lauryl sulfate\n\nsodium laureth sulfate\n\nsodium laureth-13 carboxylate\n\ndisodium cocoyl glutamate\n\nglyceryl behanate\n\npotassium cetyl phosphate\n\nPEG-10 rapeseed sterol\n\nsoapwort\n\nsodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\npolysorbate 20\n\ndisodium lauraminopropionate\n\nsodium myreth sulfate\n\nlaureth-7\n\ncocamidopropyl betaine\n\nammonium laureth sulfate\n\nsodium methyl taurate\n\nsteareth-20\n\nmagnesium oleth sulfate*",

    "body": "Skin type: Oily, acne-prone  tho years of skincare I think my skin is now normal to oily (esp in t-zone).\n\nI already have a solid routine from my trial and error journey but I can't help myself to try new things out. After all, skincare for me is therapeutic and I don't wanna get bored doing it.\n\n**TL;DR** I love the Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer.  Oxecure cleanser irritated my skin. I still love Human Heart Nature Nourishing  Cleanser.\n\n**Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer***Ingredients:*  Water,  Glycerin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C15-19 Alkane,  Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/vp Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polydecene,  Propanediol, Glyceryl Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-100 Stearate,  Squalane, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin,  Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA,  Panthenol, Alpha-glucan Oligosaccharide, Potassium Hydroxide,  Maltodextrin, Polymnia Sonchifolia Root Juice, Ceteareth-25, Propylene  Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cetyl Alcohol, BHT,  Lactobacillus, Pantolactone, Behenic Acid, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol,  Ceramide NS, Ethylhexylglycerin, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract,  Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS, Caprooyl Phytosphingosine,  Caprooyl Sphingosine, Ascrobyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Oleate,  Lecithin, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Calendula  Officinalis Flower Extract, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hypericum Perforatum  Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Tilia Cordata Flower Extract\n\n*Notable ingredients:* 5 types of ceramides - Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS paired with Cholesterol and fatty acids - Caprooyl Phytosphingosine & Caprooyl Sphingosine to mimic skin's barrier function.\n\nAlso has glycerin, panthenol, pantolactone, lactobacillus, squalane, and aloe extract.\n\nFor reference I've tried the well-loved **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** which unfortunately broke me out. I also hate its texture and how it sits on top of my skin. Then there's the **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel** which gave me a more pleasant experience than the cream. I have gone three bottles of it already. So yea, I loved it but I also found it boring. Like it's just your regular moisturizer - *Oh no, OP discovered how moisturizer works.*\n\nAnd oxecure moisturizer came into the picture. From the list of ingredients above it is way moooore extensive than the ceramide gel so I was afraid it would break me out. Fortunately, it didn't. In fact, I like it better than the ceramide gel! It is lightweight but you'll know you have applied it unlike with the gel which absorbs completely with my skin. Nevertheless, I still like it for that coz I feel like the previous products I have applied are sealed. It also doesn't pill with my sunscreen. One drawback - it is expensive. 700 pesos for 75 ml.\n\nAlso soothes my skin when it is irritated especially when the horror of using the Oxecure cleanser happened.\n\n**Oxecure ph 5.5 Gentle Cleanser***Ingredients:*  Water,  Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine,  Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate,  Cocamide MEA, Citric Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Potassium  Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Ethylhexylglycerin,  Ceramide 3, Garcinia Mangostana (Mangosteen) Peel Extract, Centella  Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Sctutellaria  Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root  Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Aloe  Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\nSurfactants: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (CAPB), Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids\n\nFrom the first week of using it, I really liked it. It didn't dry my skin out. However, days after my skin started to turn red and patchy whenever I used it. I don't know which ingredient/s sensitized my skin. I'm pretty sure not the SLES and CAPB as they are present to Celeteque cleanser (which I liked). And considering it has lot of hydrating and moisturizing ingredients, kinda bummer this turned out to be a holy fail for me. My body enjoys it now tho. Still, for me it is worth trying coz who knows it might work perfectly for you.\n\nA hunt for a cleanser started. I was using Celeteque Hydration Cleanser for years already. I didn't have any problems with it except that sometimes I feel like it kinda dries my skin especially when my skin is retinizing from tretinoin use. Still I should've stuck with *if ain't broke, don't fix it* mantra.\n\nSo one day I was at Watsons, just the usual window shopping of products. And I stumbled upon Human Heart Nature products and saw the **nourishing** variant cleanser. It brought back memories when I was just starting with skincare. When I was hopeless and felt like every products I used were not helping with my skin concerns, that cleanser gave me hope. I experienced the real definition of gentle cleansing after trying harsh scrubs and whatnot on my face.\n\n*Ingredients:*  water, decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, glycerin, Solanum lycopersicum  (tomato) fruit extract, carrageenan, tocopherol, sodium lactate, sodium gluconate, dicaprylyl ether, glyceryl oleate, hydrogenated palm  glycerides citrate, parfum, levulinic acid, sodium levulinate, phytic  acid, p-anisic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid\n\n*Surfuctants:* decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside - derived from coconut so be warry if you're sensitive to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward I bought a bottle of it. I used it for a week before giving my verdict. And now I can say that it is still the gentlest cleanser I have ever used. My skin feels supple whenever I use it. Although it has now a different packaging from what I can remember, it's still my first love. That feeling when everything feels right.\n\n*Hoy vevs iba na 'yan.*",

Aldi replaced it with Formic Acid for which CosDNA has no irritant/acne score, but did replace Laureth-10 with Laureth-4 which is worse according to CosDNA (but it’s very low on the ingredients list). \n\nAldi foaming wash has added Lactic Acid lower down on the list (Moisturising in low concentrations).\n\nBoth kinds of Aldi wash have added Glycerin.\n\nAt first glance, Aldi improved their face wash while Simple made theirs possibly slightly worse. \n\nAll product images here https://imgur.com/a/Y2qE1LZ",

I posted up here a few weeks ago to combat my home's hard water, and now I'm on to phase two of combating my seborrheic dermatitis (and the severely dry, itchy scalp that comes with it)! \n  \nA dermatologist in India recommended I use Mildy Shampoo and Keraglo AD lotion twice a week. I bought a few of each while I was there to bring back to the US, but now that I'm here, I'm not sure what the American-equivalent brands are once I run out of my Indian stock.\n\nHere's a link to the Mildy Shampoo that includes a good picture of all its ingredients: https://www.beautifulhameshablog.com/mildy-everyday-shampoo-clean-healthy-hair-review/\nThey are: GHTC, Sodium lauryl sulfate, Cocobetain, cocamidopropyl betaine, coconute diethanolamine, ethylene glycol monostearate, aloe vera, perfume & preservatives (double check the link, though, in case I mistyped something).\n\nAnd the Keraglo AD lotion claims it is composed of this: \"ketoconazole IP 2.0% w/v, lotion base q.s., color: erythrosine\" \nIf you google this particular lotion you'll see the right brand and box but all the ones on google will list additional ingredients that aren't on the one I have.\n\nThe dermatologist I saw back in India said I should get shampoos that are sulfate paraben free. I'm not sure what that means, since when I google sulfates and parabens, they seem to be separate entities. Perhaps cross-referencing with Mildy's ingredients can shed more light on that advice. Also, my head does *not* react well to Head & Shoulders or Selsun Blue, so I'm going to need a more creative/specialized suggestion than those.\n  \nThank you in advance to anyone willing to help! It's a complex inquiry, no doubt, but all advice is welcome.",

    "body": "Hi everyone, I have been dealing with canker sores (recurrent aphthous stomatitis) for over 20 years and in that time I have learned some really important things that I want to share in the hopes that it can help you and you wont have to suffer as long as I did.\n\n# CAUSE OF CANKER SORES (MOUTH ULCERS)\n\nFirstly I believe I have a good understanding of what the canker sores are and it has 2 parts.\n\n1. Something causes a little wound in your mouth. This could be a cut, scratch, biting your lip, eating a sharp food, eating an inflammatory food, an allergic reaction to something such as a food or chemical, stress causing your immune system to go into overdrive, a disease, etc.\n2. This little wound gets infected with bacteria from your mouth and becomes a canker sore for the next 2 weeks.\n\nSo we want to prevent both of these things.\n\n# KILLING BACTERIA\n\nTo kill the bacteria in your mouth, I would recommend **swishing around** **1.5% hydrogen peroxide or a product called Amosan (Sodium Perborate Monohydrate)** **which releases hydrogen peroxide**.\n\nHowever, there's a reason I would **NOT** recommend just buying a liquid hydrogen peroxide solution. It's because Hydrogen Peroxide degrades quickly when exposed to a lot of things like oxygen or light. So the moment you open a new bottle of hydrogen peroxide, it might be effective but within a few days it will degrade to the point that you will just be swishing around water.\n\nSee it's little things like that, that took me a **REALLY** long time to understand. I would use a new bottle of hydrogen peroxide and it would work great and I would think I finally have a solution to my cankers, only for the cankers to start reappearing again within a few weeks and I would think I became 'immune' to the effects of hydrogen peroxide when in reality it's just because the hydrogen peroxide degraded and was not killing any bacteria any more. I almost gave up on such an amazing solution simply because I didn't know that the hydrogen peroxide degrades once it is opened.\n\nTherefore I would recommend that you get the Amosan which comes in individually sealed packs for each use and won't  start degrading just by opening the packaging.\n\nIf you can not get Amosan then there are a number of other products that release hydrogen peroxide when added to water and swished around your mouth: Life Oral Wound Cleanser (Powder), Cankaid Mouth Rinse (Powder), VINCE mouth rinse, Colgate Peroxyl, Orajel Antiseptic Mouth Sore Rinse, Oral-B Mouth Sore Special Care Oral Rinse.\n\nBut again, any liquid version you buy will start degrading as soon as you open the bottle so you will have to buy a new one every 1-2 weeks for it to keep being effective. **Therefore always get a powder version instead. These ingredients release hydrogen peroxide when mixed with water: Sodium Perborate Monohydrate, Carbamide Peroxide.**\n\n# PREVENTING WOUNDS\n\nGreat, now the bacteria in our mouth is dead and even if we get a tiny wound, it will hopefully not get infected and become a canker.\n\nHowever we should still try to reduce the wounds as much as possible since they probably mean that we are overall **unhealthy** in some other way.\n\n**ELIMINATE PROBLEM FOODS**\n\nA lot of people report that these foods trigger or cause their canker sores to be worse:\n\n**gluten, buckwheat, whole wheat, rye, barley, flour, chocolate, nuts, figs, shellfish, soy, French mustard, vinegar, pineapples, apples, peaches, bananas, blueberries & other berries, oranges & citrus fruits, tomatoes, lemons, cow cheese, cow milk, mint, garlic, caffeine or coffee,**\n\nJust because someone else is affected does not necessarily mean you will be. And maybe you will be affected by a food not mentioned above.\n\nTherefore you should keep a detailed **FOOD DIARY** of what you eat every day to see what does or does not cause you canker sores. This is a really great guide on keeping an accurate diary: [http://www.saveyoursmile.com/cankersores/dzcankersores5.html](http://www.saveyoursmile.com/cankersores/dzcankersores5.html)\n\nGo step by step and test only ONE food at a time. Give each food enough time in your diet to see if it is causing issues or not. **I would recommend testing ONE food every 3 days to see**. Every 3 days, change the food so there is no confusion.\n\nBe **VERY** detailed. For example, there is a BIG difference between cows milk vs goats milk. Just because you can not tolerate cows milk does not mean goat milk will be an issue for you. Test conventional vs organic grass fed stuff. Maybe it depends on where it is from. For example, some people have an issue with American cheese but New Zealand cheese is fine for them.\n\nIf a particular food is an issue for you then you will probably get a canker from it within 1 hour to 24 hours of eating it.\n\nAlso don't be afraid to go back and test things that you thought were okay but were actually not. I have personally tested something for a few days and thought it was okay only to realize months later that actually its causing me issues.\n\n**TRY CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS**\n\nSome people report having benefits after using one or more of the following supplements:\n\n* Vitamin K2 MK4 (this is a highly important Vitamin that we really don't get enough of unless we are eating grass fed and finished meat)\n* Vitamin B12\n* Vitamin B1\n* Vitamin B2\n* Vitamin B6\n* L-Lysine\n* Folic Acid\n* Iron\n* Zinc\n* Vitamin C\n* Vitamin A\n* Vitamin D3\n* Vitamin E\n\nAgain, only test 1 supplement at a time and for supplements I would recommend testing out each one for 1 week on its own to see exactly what effect it has on you physically, and mentally.\n\nPersonally I have found that supplements don't really do anything for me and sometimes even make things worse and I do not take them. I have tested out a ton of different brands, tried out different routes like eating, putting it under the tongue, putting it on my skin, etc.\n\nI would always recommend you get your blood levels tested for all these nutrients before you supplement in case you are just going overboard or if you truly need it.\n\n**MAYBE SUPPLEMENTS ARE ACTUALLY BAD?**\n\nSome people report they actually get cankers FROM vitamin supplements.\n\nSo don't go into this whole thing assuming that supplements are angels and only good for you. You never know exactly what your body needs. Besides, these supplements are usually synthetic chemicals and often very structurally different than the real balanced nutrient in the food. They also have a lot of additives added to them.\n\nIn particular some people report that these supplements cause them to have worse cankers:\n\n* Vitamin C\n* Vitamin D3\n* Calcium\n* Folic Acid\n* Multivitamin\n\nBut it could be any supplement for you.\n\nI would recommend you have a healthy diet where you are naturally getting all your minerals and vitamins.\n\nFor Vitamin D3, which is hard to get from food, I would recommend going outside in the sun more or buying a Vitamin D3 lamp for home use.\n\nPersonally I feel VERY bad with a Vitamin D3 supplement. It makes me more stressed and anxious and gives me bad breath. That's one of the reasons I suspect I can drink goat milk but I can not drink cows milk since all cow milk in Canada is required to be fortified with a Vitamin D3 supplement but I didn't have any issue when I drank cow milk in California without any fortification. I don't have this issue with real Vitamin D3 from the sun.\n\n**CERTAIN MEDICATIONS MIGHT BE AN ISSUE**\n\nA lot of people report that NSAIDs cause them cankers. That includes ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen.\n\nMethotrexate can cause cankers.\n\nThere could be other medication as well.\n\nTalk to your doctor about it and keep a detailed journal of your medication you take every day.\n\nMaybe the health issue that is requiring you to take these medications will go away if you cut out the inflammatory foods or the other things causing your cankers.\n\n**REDUCE STRESS**\n\nStress is probably one of the biggest triggers for me.\n\nTry the following:\n\n* Meditate\n* Prayer (if you are religious)\n* Go to your church or mosque or anywhere else (if you are religious)\n* Do yoga\n* Sleep on time\n* Wake up on time\n* Have a routine\n* Warm Baths\n* Hang out with family & friends\n* Avoid overthinking\n* Remain positive & optimistic\n* Join a club for a hobby\n\nThis might be controversial but from my personal experience I would also add:\n\n* Avoid technology because I find that the EMF radiation seems to stress me out and cause me issues if I use technology for too long\n* Avoid social media as I find it stressful to compare myself to others\n* Completely eliminate pornography and masturbation as I find it triggers a stressful response in the body and I get a canker the next day\n* Avoid other addictive things such as too much YouTube or video games or internet in general\n* Go outside more\n\n**AVOID OTHER CHEMICALS**\n\nFor a long time I would get run down and feel really bad with cankers and I just couldn't figure it out. Until one day I switched the laundry detergent to an organic brand. Then my situation got much better.\n\nThere are a lot of toxic chemicals in dish soap, laundry detergent, perfumes, plastics, and other things. **I would advise that you always buy organic for everything, and avoid chemical use as much as possible**.\n\nThis should reduce the immune response in your body preventing more cankers.\n\n**AVOID SLS TOOTHPASTE**\n\nMany people report a chemical called **Sodium Lauryl Sulfate** in their toothpaste or other products causing them canker sores. Buy a toothpaste without this.\n\n**EAT NUTRITIOUS FOOD**\n\nI found that these foods tend to be safe and give you all the nutrients you need:\n\n* Australian Grass Fed Lamb (All nutrients you need and especially Vitamin K2 MK4 which is hard to get)\n* Goat Milk\n* Carrots (Vitamin A)\n* Gluten Free Bread (Fiber and extra calories)\n* Organic Pasture Raised Eggs (All Vitamins & Nutrients)\n* Cream Cheese\n* Pickles\n* Chicken\n* Potatoes\n* Sunflower Oil\n* French Fries\n* Dates\n* Emu Oil (High Vitamin K2 MK4 and all other fat soluble nutrients)\n\nAgain, test for yourself if the above foods work for you or not.\n\n**AVOID HISTAMINES**\n\nIf you get a lot of canker sores and very often recurring then try to avoid foods high in histamines or ones that trigger a histamine response.\n\nHistamines signal an immune response in your body.\n\nAged meat has a lot of histamines (which is why I recommended lamb or chicken which are usually fresh and low histamine as opposed to beef which is often aged for weeks before being sold). Freeze any meat you don't eat immediately.\n\nOther trigger foods mentioned above also have high histamines or trigger a histamine response. In fact its scary how many of the trigger foods mentioned above are also known to be high in histamines or cause a histamine response in the body.\n\nSearch for a low histamine diet if you want to learn more about this.\n\n**AVOID ALCOHOL**\n\nMany people report alcohol triggering their canker sores.\n\n**CONTRACEPTIVES**\n\nSome people report contraceptive pills cause their cankers.\n\n**AVOID ADDITIVES & PRESERVATIVES**\n\nSome people report that food preservatives cause their cankers. This can include food colorings\n\n**AVOID SUGAR**\n\nSome people report that sugar causes or worsens their cankers.\n\nAlso avoid sugar alternatives like aspartame.\n\n**CORTICOSTEROIDS**\n\nThis should really be a last resort but if your cankers are debilitating then your doctor can give you a shot of corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation and pain.\n\nHowever I have tried almost every pharmacy drug for cankers and the only thing that worked for me long term was the natural methods I previous explained.\n\n**PREDNISONE**\n\nThis is a drug which can potentially reduce and prevent cankers but it can have a number of side effects so it should not be used for long or often.\n\n**COLCHICINE**\n\nThis is a drug which can potentially reduce and prevent cankers but it can have a number of side effects.\n\n**VALTREX**\n\nThis is a drug which can potentially reduce and prevent cankers but it can have a number of side effects.\n\n**KENALOG (TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE)**\n\nThis is a drug some people say helps them. However it is a corticosteroid which are known to have many long term side effects so I would be very cautious in using this. I have not personally used it.\n\n**SALT WASH**\n\nSome people report swishing around water mixed with salt helps them or applying salt directly to the canker. However I found this did not work or only made it worse.\n\n**ALUM**\n\nSome people report applying alum powder to the canker sore helps the but personally this did not do anything for me.\n\n**WATERMELON FROST**\n\nSome people report watermelon frost applied to their canker sore helps them. I have not personally tried this.\n\n**GO TO A DOCTOR & NUTRITIONIST**\n\nI would advise that you work with professionals while trying to figure out exactly which foods are an issue or other triggers. We get so caught up in our pain that we start making mistakes but they can help keep you in check.\n\nI really wish I had a guide like this 10 years ago since it would have helped prevent a lot of pain. I hope everyone can see this and take advantage of it!",

Perhaps they have something to do with the micro biome of your mouth and doing things like changing hygiene affect that and helps for you. \n\nAlso I get cankers all the time that are not the result of trauma in my mouth. As a matter of fact I can feel them coming before they appear on the surface. \n\nOralmedic was a life-altering discovery for me. It deserves a mention and a try for you if you haven’t tried it yet. \n\nThanks again!",

An inch or two shorter than classic length (Aka mid butt length hair), High Porosity\n* **Hair concerns:** Split ends, normal amount of hairfall, prone to frizz, can look dry and damaged if I don't take care of it.\n* **Scalp type:** Normal, I think. Gets oily 2nd day night or 3rd day morning after hairwash\n* **Scalp concerns:** I don't use any product on my scalp but I feel like it's prone to build up and if I don't use an anti-dandruff shampoo every few washes, I get CCs on my forehead.

Pre Shampoo - Some homemade oil concoction (I add a lot of tiny oil bottles, I needed to empty, so I just mixed them all together.) or Plum Avocado Hair Mask\n2. Anti dandruff - Scalpe pro (I got L'oreal pure clay a while ago, to see if that will work instead of this, but haven't fully tested it out yet)\n3. Scalp shampoo - Alpecin Double Effect\n4. Length of the hair - Dove hydrating shampoo for curly hair (early days, haven't formed any impression yet.)\n5. Protein conditioner - Plum Olive and Macadamia Hair Mask (as and when necessary)\n6. Conditioner - Garnier Hair Food Papaya variant or Banana variant ( I like Papaya way better than banana, but neither of them are worth full price and Im still mourning the discontinuation of Matrix biolage purple cap)\n\nI've reviewed quite a few of the products I use, including Alpecin [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vqot48/my_current_haircare_routine_reviews_reequil/), but Alpecin deserves its own review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Climatic conditions under which the product was tested:** All. Summer, What passes for winter in the south, Monsoon.\n* **Usage timeline:** 1.5 years atleast. Almost done with my second bottle. And I've purchased it in Mid-September, this bottle has lasted me 8 months.\n* **Ingredient List:** [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n* **Price:** MRP 699 for 200 ml. Never seen this on discount. :(\n* **Texture, Consistency details:** Normal shampoo consistency, A blueish grey colour, so definitely added colour. You can see a hit of the colour and consistency [here](https://imgur.com/CVTsVhO.jpg)\n* **Fragrance:** HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n* **Usage:** I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply **on scalp only (Never below nape)**. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp. If I've oiled twice, I shampoo twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Effect on hair issues and result of using the product:** Shiny frizz free hair, but definite loss of volume. If I had to use 1 word to describe it \"sleek\".\n* **Experience and thoughts in detail:**\n\n***Old Review, copied from my previous post and slightly edited***\n\nThis shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation.\n\nAlpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (obvious conflict of interests. I remember reading the study but can only find the [abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17396054/) now) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit this for it. Maybe it'll work for others but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Updated Review***\n\nBarely anything to update if I'm honest. I stand by everything I said above, and they still hold true.\n\nAbout hairfall, I definitely don't think it helps. SO still thinks it helps, but acknowledges that he likes the user experience of it so much that he may be biased. Don't trust him.\n\nIn 2018, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled that caffeine shampoo Alpecin must no longer advertise that it can \"help to reduce hair loss\" as there was no adequate evidence to support the claim.  ***I definitely don't recommend buying this hoping it'll cure your hairfall issues.***\n\nThe main reason, I wanted to re-review this, is to post [this video](https://imgur.com/pt98TCe)\n\nI took these too [Pic 1](https://imgur.com/Sb7u13B.jpg), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/fZMkSHb.jpg), but even though they are from back cam, quality is super bad. The video is a decent representation of what it looks like.  I'll update this post with better pics when I'm able to take them.\n\n**Other things to add**\n\n* The whole time I used Alpecin, I also used Scalpe pro. ie I used scalpe pro every few washes most of the year, but peak summer and winter or if I see signs of CCs, I used it every single wash and followed it up with Alpecin.  So every wash I used Alpecin but every few washes I used Scalpe pro + Alpecin.\n* u/santa96 has commented below that it didn't work for them, so I was running over possibilities. And one theory is the AD shampoo was actually stripping than I thought (I have used it alone, only for experimenting / testing purposes.  I originally thought it wasn't as stripping as most other AD shampoos but still drying compared to regular shampoos. Which is why I followed it up with Alpecin. But it could be that continued usage, caused dryness and the protein in the Alpecin was immediate damage control and THAT's why I love it so much.\n* This is just a hypothesis and is of now, untested. But my scalpe pro is almost over and I should know in a couple of months if I right.\n* Anyone for now, I obviously need to test it out under more conditions. This review is moot. I mean I still love it, but it needs to have more information for anyone else to judge if it'll work for you and I currently don't have that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ETA on 10/02/24: \n\nI had previously tagged this as OP-ED because I wanted to test out the following.\n\na) If I use Alpecin with no stripping products will it cause protein overload\n\nAnswer: No. It doesn't. 9 months later I still use Alpecin every single wash.\n\n* I've used it with the following variables affecting it\n   * Oiled hair\n   * Oiled hair + Clarifying shampoo (Loreal Pure Clay)\n   * Oiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n   * Unoiled hair\n   * Unoiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n\nand no protein overload. In fact except for a couple of months in the middle where I damaged my hair in beach vacations, my hair is way way way more healthier now than it was before.\n\nb) If I use it with a garden variety clarifying shampoo instead of a stripping anti-dandruff shampoo, will I still rave about it.\n\nAnswer: Yes. I would and I am. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Anything that you think others might find a con:** Price probably\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Holy Grail, Forever repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;",

I originally looked into them because they asked me to be their spokesperson and, as I do with everything, I began doing my research and realized not only did I not agree with their product ingredients, their marketing made them look like they were doing something positive when really they put lots of toxins into their ingredients. When I said this to them they didn't respond to me. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the consumers to do their research, but I wanted to put it out there since I know that Lush is one company that I can say with confidence that I do not support. I'm all about products that don't have packaging, but not at the expense of my health or the health of the environment. For this reason, I do not recommend shopping at Lush Cosmetics North America\nYou can have effective cosmetics without ANY toxic chemicals or ingredients.\n. \nLush uses toxic and synthetic ingredients and are not sustainable. Some of their toxic ingredients to name a few to look out for and stay away from: propylene glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate, Hydroxycitronellal, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Alkyl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, lilial, alpha-isomethyl ionone, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, glycerin... all of these ingredients are in their products.\nThey list their synthetic ingredients on their website and use petrochemicals, SLS, other sulfates, and synthetic fragrance. Before you purchase products, be sure to look at the ingredient lists.\nThat company really makes me sad because they trick people into thinking they are doing something good, when really they sell products with toxic ingredients. https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder They say \"Our fragrances are made up of approximately 60% natural oils, resins and absolutes.\" which means at least 40% of their ingredients are not natural and they don't state what their \"perfume\" or \"fragrance\" is.\nIf you are wondering about ingredients, look them up. I always love ewg.org as a resource.\n\nI can see on this subreddit the popularity of Lush because of their package free products. I love their products as well so I find this a little upsetting from Lauren. As you can see from the post, she seems to put down one company to promote her own shop and products which screams suspicion and \"holier than thou\" to me. She is also getting some fair critique on her stance as well.\n\nPersonally, I have never seen Lush advertise their products as 100% all natural, but \"Fresh Handmade Cosmetics\" and they have always clearly stated what is synthetic and what is natural in each of their products. (I don't know where that rumour came about).\n\nAlso, what does she mean by toxic? Everything can be toxic at a certain amount, but of course we need to also be conscious of the environment and not everything synthetic is particularly bad for the environment. I will continue to use Lush because I don't think that ALL their products are bad when you can research the ingredients yourself and make an informed decision. Lush has always promoted sustainability for their products and donating money from their profits to charitable costs to both fair trade workers and the environment. This, I believe, is 100% better than 90% of the cosmetic market. At least they are using most fresh fruit and oils instead of chemicals! \n\nWhat are your thoughts? I'd love to have this conversation with the rest of you as Lauren is a big voice in this community. ",

But I can make it to their store without driving, the products I enjoy are effective and package free, and at the end of the day, I don't have any more mentally capacity to stress about the quality of my attempt to do a good deed.\n\nI don't think we should be spending our time bashing companies that don't align 100% to our vision of a perfect example. We should spend our time applauding the parts that people get right while campaigning the brands we enjoy to improve. Ultimately, when someone sees me with a muslin bag of shampoo bars, the conversation I get to have about a still seemingly radical idea is far more important to me than the tradeoffs I made by using this product.",

We need more folks producing the things we want, even if that means entering the market ourselves. Even Lauren’s own Simply Co laundry detergent is never in stock (or hasn’t actually been sold online yet). A lot of other products on Package Free Shop’s online store are frequently unavailable.

Because they contain chlorophyll which oxygenate the mouth and make it hard for the bacteria which cause bad breath to grow... You can also consider taking a chlorophyll supplement.\n\nLimit your protein intake... I.e eggs ,nuts chicken etc\n\nStay away from dairy... Eliminate it completely\n\nAbsolutely no alcohol whatsoever (including mouthwashes containing alcohol)\n\nNo coffee as coffee dries the mouth out\n\nGreen tea is what ive started to drink as its a great antioxidant.\n\n\nKeep your mouth hydrated constantly throughout the day so drink water constantly throughout the day... A dry mouth is bad when trying to fight halitosis.\n\nAfter every meal i have i add some Apple cider vinegar into my water... This helps with acidity in the gut which helps with proper digestion of the food \n\nI take a antifungal in the morning you can choose between oregano oil (either a drop in your water or tablet form.... Or you can consume a tea spoon of coconut oil)\n\nIn terms of my mouth hygiene routine... I use a mouthwash called Pro fresh.... This is expensive but its alcohol free , flouride free and also contains the magical ingredient chlorine dioxide.... Use it as indicated on the bottle \n( Do not use alcohol based mouthwashes or mouthwashes containing flouride)\n\nAfter this i add salt to a glass and add some water... Then i dip my tongue scraper in and scrape my tongue from the back forward... Rinsing the tongue scraper after every scrape. I then gargle and swish  the remaining water round my mouth.\n\nI then dilute some hydrogen peroxide into water and gargle and swish around my mouth. I then rinse out the remaining hydrogen peroxide out my mouth(you dont want to swallow it)\n\nLastly i brush my teeth with baking soda but the trick here is this... Do not rinse the baking soda out your mouth when you've finished brushing... Let the residue sit in your mouth... You can spit the excess out but dont rinse your mouth out .\n\n( Never use toothpaste that contains flouride as it kills both good and bad Bacteria ultimately making your breath worse.... And dont use toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulfate this is essentially soap and will dry the mouth out excessively) \n\nI hope this helps... This is what ive done to find some relief im going to continue this for 30days and may eventually do 90days. Give it a go and be strict for the 30days... We can beat this dreaded disease together ❤️",

Her cheeks were completely red all the time, and nothing helped. Finally when my then-teenage husband went to see a dermatologist for his cystic acne, she asked the doctor about her skin.\n\nHe told her to switch toothpastes. That entire time she had been allergic to her toothpaste! She couldn’t believe it. After switching toothpaste brands her “rosacea” completely disappeared within three days. She’d simply been allergic to it.\n\nI never even thought of something like toothpaste giving someone an allergic reaction—so for those of you who are having similar issues, you may want to make sure you don’t have a fragrance or flavoring in your toothpaste that you might be allergic to. It can’t hurt to check.\n\nI’ve also read that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate can cause allergic reactions for some people, but that’s in a lot of toothpastes.

I've been taking all the easy precautions like wetting my hair with clean water before getting in the pool and wearing a swim cap, but now I'm looking to specific products that help with removing buildup from chlorine and other pool chemicals. In my research, the only ingredients I've found that are good for this purpose and commonly found in clarifying shampoos and some conditioners are:\n\n* Sodium Thiosulfate ([neutralizes chlorine](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n* Disodium/Tetrasodium EDTA ([chelating agent](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n\nWhich brings me to my question, which is a little silly and neurotic, but I hope someone can help me. I've really fallen in love with this [L'Oreal Kids 2-in-1 Swim Shampoo](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/hair-care/products/shampoo/loreal-kids-extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo.aspx?shade=extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo). I just love how it smells, I love the bottle, I love how cheap it is, and I love how it reminds me of when I was a kid! Upon looking into the ingredients though, I found neither Sodium Thiosulfate nor EDTAs among them. Here they are listed out:\n\n>AQUA/WATER/EAU • SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE • DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE • PEG-200 HYDROGENATED GLYCERYL PALMATE • POLYSORBATE 20 • SODIUM CHLORIDE • PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE • HEXYLENE GLYCOL • DISODIUM RICINOLEAMIDO MEA-SULFOSUCCINATE • PARFUM/FRAGRANCE • SODIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • POLYQUATERNIUM-10 • SODIUM METHYLPARABEN • MAGNESIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • MAGNESIUM LAURETH SULFATE • SODIUM OLETH SULFATE • DMDM HYDANTOIN • MAGNESIUM OLETH SULFATE • CI 47005 / YELLOW 10 • CI 14700 / RED 4\n\nBasically I want to know, am I missing something? How can L'Oreal confidently claim that this shampoo \"removes chlorine\" if there are no ingredients that are specifically capable of that? I like this product a lot and want to continue using it but I also want to make sure I'm getting all the pool chemicals out of my hair after I swim.\n\n^(In before \"just use it if you like it,\" I know my question is kinda silly, I just want to understand how these ingredients work!)",

I accidentally get products containing silicone in my hair on a daily basis and have no way of removing them. I am also concerned about the potential effects of getting my sunscreen stuck in my hair next to my skin.\n\nI no longer think that dimethicone is a bad or dispensable ingredient. I understand the difference between sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, as well as the difference between cyclomethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone and amodimethicone. I just bought a shampoo containing the mild surfactant sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate and a conditioner containing dimethicone after spending an hour reading the back of haircare products at the shops. Crazy, man! This is a huge deal and I'm totally jittery.\n\nI think that no-poo can work well for some people, mainly those with short or curly hair. I have long, semi-straight hair, and no matter how much I used my BBB I could not get my hair smooth. I had frizzy, split ends just a short time after getting my hair cut. I kinda succeeded for a long time while telling myself that this was what healthy hair looked like, then I reassessed my needs and here I am. I got all of the damaged hair cut off today and I'm ready to try this shit out.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

Even so, everyone can learn and benefit from at least some of the techniques and knowledge of no poo, that they can take with them even if they don't stick to no poo. Using a low-poo is still waaaaaaay better than an SLS shampoo.\n\nIf the BBB you tried doesn't work for your hair type (I'm wondering if it has a lot of plastic bristles mixed in, because often they do, and those damage hair), I highly HIGHLY recommend getting a wooden bristled brush-- whether you are no poo or not. The bristles are spread far apart, still flexible if you get one of the squishy brushes, and the wood does distribute natural hair oils a bit, which is still beneficial even if (or especially if) you use a low-poo or shampoo cleanser. It can give some life back to your ends between washes without looking greasy or damaging your hair. You can get them at whole foods or health foods stores or online. Best of luck to you!",

    "body": "How I cured my blepharitis by cutting out sodium laureth sulfate (SLES)\n\nAfter struggling with “incurable” blepharitis on and off for years — dry, itchy, inflamed eyes, crusty lashes, the whole lot — I finally found the culprit: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES).\n\nIt’s a common ingredient in tons of everyday products — especially anything that foams. SLES (and its close cousin, SLS) is a detergent/surfactant that helps products lather, but it’s also a known irritant, especially around the delicate eyelid area.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat made me suspicious?\n\nI’d tried all the usual stuff: warm compresses, lid scrubs, tea tree oil, antibiotics, even steroid drops. Nothing worked long-term. I started noticing that my symptoms flared after showers or face washing. That got me thinking: what’s in my shampoo, face wash, and toothpaste?\n\nA quick check of the ingredient lists, and bam — Sodium Laureth Sulfate was in almost everything I was using near my eyes.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat I cut out:\n\nI went through my entire routine and home products and swapped out anything with SLES (or SLS). This included:\n\t•\tShampoo (many brands like Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences contain it)\n\t•\tFace wash and body wash\n\t•\tToothpaste (yes, some brands foam with SLS/SLES!)\n\t•\tHand soap and shaving foam\n\t•\tEven my dish soap and laundry detergent\n\nBasically, if it lathered or foamed, I checked the label.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat happened after I cut it out?\n\nWithin a week, my eyes were significantly less irritated. The redness reduced, and my eyelids stopped feeling gritty and sore. After two weeks, the crusting and flare-ups stopped altogether.\n\nIt’s been a couple of years now, and I haven’t had a single flare. I still do basic lid hygiene (occasional warm compress, gentle eyelid wipe), but nothing intense.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy it matters:\n\nSLES isn’t the cause of everyone’s blepharitis, but if you’re sensitive to it — and a lot of us with blepharitis probably are — it can be a constant source of low-level irritation, especially if it’s getting near your eyes every day.\n\nSLES can:\n\t•\tDisrupt the eyelid’s lipid barrier\n\t•\tIrritate the meibomian glands\n\t•\tWorsen dry eye symptoms\n\t•\tContribute to eyelid inflammation\n\nAnd since it’s so widespread, you might not even realise how often you’re being exposed.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat to look for:\n\nCheck your product labels for:\n\t•\tSodium Laureth Sulfate\n\t•\tSodium Lauryl Sulfate\n\t•\tSodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate\n\nLook for products labeled “SLS-free” or “for sensitive skin.” Baby products are a good place to start, but always double-check — even some baby shampoos still sneak it in.\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR:\n\nBlepharitis gone after cutting out SLES. If you’ve tried everything else, check your labels — your shampoo or face wash might be sabotaging your eyes.",

    "body": "I've used this product for like a year now and just recently looked at the ingredients to try and dupe it. I feel like there's no reason this should cost $25 for 8oz. I love using this as a pre-poo because I love the minty-tingly feeling. It's a very conditioning product imo but the surfactants help rinse it out easy. In my dupe I wanted to make this a little more conditioning with BTMS-50 instead of their weird cetearyl alcohol and SLS emulsifier. Instead of SLS, I opted for SCI and CMPB to make this product lather and rinse out easier. I also added some centramonium chloride which the original product used to contain (it no longer does) to add to the conditioning feeling. The bulk of my version is cetyl alcohol because the OG product is very slippy and when I rinse it out it can easily detangle the length of my hair. \n\nThe original ingredients: Fresh Mint Infusion (Mentha Piperita) (Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract) , Water (Aqua) , Cetearyl Alcohol and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate , Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate , Citric Acid , Propylene Glycol , Honey , Peppermint Oil (Mentha piperita) , Sweet Orange Oil (Citrus sinensis) , Spearmint Oil (Mentha spicata) , Grapefruit Oil (Citrus paradisi) , Nettle Absolute (Urtica urens) , Neroli Oil (Citrus Aurantium amara) , Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Olea europaea) , *Limonene , *Linalool , *Citral , Fragrance , Methylparaben , Propylparaben .\n\nMy version: \n\nSURFACTANT PHASE | PHASE A \n\nSCI 10%\n\nCMPB 7% \n\nCentramonium chloride 4%\n\nWATER PHASE| PHSSE B \n\n Distilled Water 57.5%\n\nHoneyquat 3%\n\nOIL PHASE| PHASE C\n\nCetyl alcohol 6%\n\nBTMS 50 4%\n\nOlive Oil 4%\n\nMenthol crystals 2%\n\nCOOLDOWN PHASE | PHASE D \n\nPeppermint EO 1%\n\nSpearmint EO 1%\n\nLiquid Germall Plus 0.5%\n\nHeated phase A, B, and C in a water bath until everything was heated thoroughly then added the water phase to the oil phase, blended for about 30 seconds and added in my surfactant phase. It'll be quite runny until it cools. Add your Cooldown phase and it's pretty much ready to use. \n\nI apply this to my scalp 15 minutes before washing. When I get into the shower to rinse it, my scalp feels very moisturized. It still lathers a tiny bit upon rinsing it out, but I feel like my version is a bit more slippy than the original which I love. I would appreciate any thoughts and feedback! \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/TcKHhkE",

        "body": "If it does stay emulsified, I'd be concerned that some of your ingredients are not what they should be, or the surfactants didn't end up in the final product at all. Or, because I've been wrong before and I'm feeling cynical today, you are a master chemist here to troll or pwn or flex or dab or whatever and yes I'm an old and should go shout at the clouds.\n\nTrying to be funny so that I don't sound like a total killjoy. I'm not trying to be a jerk, but your formula doesn't make sense to me.\n\nYou put an anionic surfactant in a cationic emulsion. In my experience, that's going to become gritty and chunky and separate. If it is in that tub, do poke through to the bottom to make sure that it hasn't separated before using it each time.\n\nSCI is chemically incompatible with BTMS and CETAC. SCI can be used at about that concentration with a true non-ionic surfactant based emulsifying wax to make a cream product, but when I've done it the result has been very thick and not pleasant for using on hair. (Yes, I know that people use BTMS with SCI in shampoo bars, but it isn't an aqueous solution or emulsion so the incompatible charges aren't an issue.)\n\n10% SCI won't stay fluid for long in any case. 7% CAPB isn't typically enough to keep it as a paste, not for me anyway, and it won't keep it suspended in an emulsion. It'll crystalize and fall out like the uncooperative spiteful princess of an ingredient that it is.\n\nI have mixed CETAC into CAPB as part of a liquid shampoo, because I wanted to see this unusual chemistry quirk for myself. It is noted in a patent for a shampoo. It can, but there's no real point to it. Now we have cationic polymers that are designed to work in anionic surfactant products.\n\nIf you remove the SCI and CAPB, you've got a conditioner. If you want to leave it on your head for any period of time, you should reduce or probably leave the CETAC out of future versions. It's much weaker than BTMS and you probably wouldn't notice the difference.\n\nThe original has less than 1% olive oil. It can go rancid quickly and doesn't add anything beyond being oily. Coconut oil would be better, as it has a much longer life and might have real benefits to hair. Babassu oil would be even better because it has the good characteristics of coconut oil while being silkier.\n\nAlso, that's rather a lot of essential oils and menthol. Twice as much as I would consider a safe maximum. It doesn't have to burn to work, I promise.\n\nIf you want to make a close dupe, use anionic surfactants. Cetearyl Alcohol and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is an anionic emulsfying wax (trade names include Crodex A and Lanette W). They add some Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, probably for rinsibility. At best this product has a pH of 6.5, but possibly up to 8. If I were going to attempt this I would use glyceryl stearate SE and DLS.\n\nIf it ever contained CETAC, it was more than 5 years ago from what I could find in old ingredients lists for Lush Roots. But without a zwitterion like CAPB to do the magic, it could never have contained it in any useful amount. CAPB by itself is likely to destabilize an anionic emulsion, but CETAC would make one fail.\n\nA way to make a less close but more similar than a conditioner dupe, and the one I would suggest, would be to use a non-ionic emulsifying wax. A lotion with 5% emulsifying wax (either polysorbate 60 or ceteareth 20, the latter being more silky), a cationic polymer, and no more than 10% oils & oil soluble ingredients, makes for a surprisingly good pre-wash conditioner.",

Figure out what you want to focus on first, and try introducing that.\n\n2) Hada Labo is pretty well known for basic ingredients and a focus on hyaluronic acid, which if used properly can help with hydration. I love HL foaming face wash in the pump.  I have combination skin, and while it dries out my dry parts, it is the same pH as your face should be, and I compensate with layering various of moisture-promoting products with key ingredients to address my problems.\n\n3) cosdna is your friend.  I'm pretty sure you've used it, but if you compare what you're using now for potential triggers (outside of the pH of your cleanser), you might be able to look for products that will not have your triggers.\n\n4) unfortunately AB products are YMMV to the umpteenth level, and it's understandable why you feel lost.  For example, I love Mizon all-in-one snil (I use as an essence) and my skin hates Mizon's returning starfish cream (allergic response).  Patch testing and trying samples are where trying AB products is both time-consuming and f*&king fun.  I believe RoseRoseShop has a lot of great samples, so you could start there? \n\nGood luck and have fun!!",

But to confirm, does this soap actually do what soap usually does aka remove bacteria?\n\nCan I use it to clean my hands after going to the bathroom, for example? Or is it really just suitable for use in the shower?  \n\n\nEdit:// After some research enabled by a commenter, I have found the following:\n\nFrom this source: [https://www.beckystallowtreasures.com/blogs/news/117149188-soap-vs-detergent-whats-the-difference](https://www.beckystallowtreasures.com/blogs/news/117149188-soap-vs-detergent-whats-the-difference)\n\n>In labeling, detergents *may not* be called soap.  It does not contain a full fatty acid (only a hydrocarbon) and it may or may not even use an alkali. It's completely synthetic. It does not fit the definition of a soap; it's a detergent.  However, this doesn't stop clever marketers from **calling their product \"beauty bar\"**, \"anti-aging moisturizing bar,\" or \"deodorant bar.\" This also doesn't stop marketers for wanna-be-natural products to say their sodium lauryl sulfate is all-natural because the hydrocarbon came \"from coconut oil.\"  \nOften times people use the word \"soap\" when referring to anything that cleans -- for example, \"dish soap,\" \"hand soap,\" \"anti-bacterial soap,\" etc.  However, this can be detrimental for one's understanding because, unlike [real soap which mechanically removes dirt AND kills bacteria](https://www.beckystallowtreasures.com/blogs/news/116322756-the-dirty-truth-about-bar-soap), detergents can only physically remove dirt.\n\n**TL;DR: A beauty bar does not kill bacteria, the way real soap does. Don't use it for washing your hands after you visit the bathroom.**",

    "body": "Hi all! I have recently gathered all the info on Salicylic Acid that I have in my personal knowledge base and decided to publish it as a guidelines that can be referenced in the future.\n\nI decided to do this because question about Salicylic Acid appear from time to time in the sub and I also see some wrong information from YouTube videos when people are trying to formulate it. Hope this information would be helpful for you!\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI AM NOT A CHEMIST!\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR!\n\nI DON'T HAVE ANY SKINCARE, CHEMISTRY, MEDICAL OR BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION!\n\nAll the information is gathered over the internet sources and some is referenced (+ a bit of personal DIY experience). I am open to any corrections and additions. Please leave them in comments and I'll include them in this article.\n\n# General info\n\n>**BE CAUTIOS! IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO ASPIRIN THEN YOU MOST LIKELY HAVE ALLERGY TO SALICYLIC ACID**\n\n**INCI:** Salicylic Acid  \n**Type:** Acid, BHA  \n**Functions:** Exfoliation, Anti-inflammatory  \n**Treats:** Acne, Blackheads, Keratosis Pilaris, Sebum production  \n**Usage rate:** 0.5 - 3.0%  \n**Usable pH range:** 3.5  \n**pKa:** 2.97  \n**Solubility:** Alcohols, Glycols, Oils, Surfactants  \n**Molar mass:** 138.121 g/mol (Daltons)\n\n# Usage rate\n\nDue to possible poisoning, based on European regulations ([SCCS - Final Opinion on Salicylic acid](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/sccs-final-opinion-salicylic-acid-2023-06-09_en)) maximum usage rates of Salicylic Acid in skincare products are:\n\n* 3% in wash-off hair products;\n* 2% in other leave-on products, excluding the mentioned below;\n* 0.5% for body lotions, eye shadows, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, oral products and non-spray deodorants.\n\n>**!DANGER!**  \nBetter to avoid formulating sprayable products due to possible inhalation. Also, special attention is required for the use of SA in eye products, as it shows potential of causing serious damage to eyes.\n\nUSA most likely has the same regulation on SA. It is also an OTC drug in USA and should be labeled in a special section of the product packaging.\n\nSouth Korea has even stricter rules for direct SA. The maximum usage rate is up to 0.5% for any product type ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2d613u/maximum_bha_in_korea_05/)). That's why Korean skincare products often use **Willow Bark Extract** and/or **Betaine Salicylate** as active ingredient instead.\n\n# Solubility\n\n# Water\n\nAlthough Salicylic Acid is a polar molecule it is poorly soluble in water (which is also a polar molecule), because the polar parts of the molecule attached to the bigger non-polar part of it, affecting the properties. ([Chemical Book](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/the-polar-and-non-polar-characteristics-in-the-structure-of-salicylic-acid.htm)).\n\n# Depending on temperature\n\nSolubility in water depending on the temperature ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid)):\n\n|Water temperature (°C)|Solubility (g/L)|Solubility (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0|1.24|0.124|\n|25|2.48|0.248|\n|40|4.14|0.414|\n|75|17.41|1.741|\n|100|77.79|7.779|\n\nWhich means if you take 100ml of water under room temperature (25 °C) you can dissolve up to 0.248g of SA in it. If you boil the water it will take up to 7.779g of SA, but precipitates when you cool the solution down.\n\n# Depending on pH\n\nSolubility increases with increasing pH, because part of SA becomes \"neutralized\" and therefore more soluble in water. Can be estimated for any given pH using the pKa of Salicylic Acid:\n\n* At a pH of 2.97 (pKa): 50% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form\n* At a pH of 4: 90% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form.\n* At a pH of 5: about 99% is in \"neutralized\" form.\n\nHere is a free acid calculator (not only for BHA) at any pH level: [LabMuffin Beauty](https://labmuffin.com/free-acid-calculator-for-exfoliants-at-specific-ph-levels/). WIth this spreadsheet you can calculate how much Salicylic Acid will be in protonated form (not neutralized, free acid) under any pH.\n\n# Betaine\n\nDue to strict regulation of SA in Korea and high popularity of Korean skincare products, new ingredient has been researched and introduced as a gentler alternative to SA called **Betaine Salicylate**.\n\nBetaine forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with Salicylic Acid rather than a salt, which increases its solubility. Formulated with it at pH 3.0-3.5, with a 2:1 molar ratio (1.7g to 1g) of Betaine to Salicylic Acid and it remains relatively soluble. Betaine mixed with Salicylic Acid at the right proportion results in a liquid ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/do-sodium-citrate-or-betaine-react-with-salicylic-acid/)).\n\n# Surfactants\n\nGreat solubility in many surfactants, especially the ones that start with \"Sodium\" (Sodium Laureth Sulfate etc). That's why formulating a face wash or shampoo with Salicylic Acid is not a big problem and won't be covered here.\n\nAccording to [\"The solubilization of salicylic acid by a series of non-ionic surfactants\"](https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-abstract/23/Supplement_1/241S/6200573) the likely mechanism is somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation.\n\nBased on [\"Solubilization of Salicylic Acid by Polysorbate 80 as Determined by Solubility Titration\"](https://jpharmsci.org/article/S0022-3549(15)33858-2/abstract), to completely solubilize SA in water the ratio between SA and:\n\n* **Polysorbate 80** should be 0.15\n* **Polysorbate 20** should be 0.13\n\nTherefore to solubilize 2% of SA in water required around 13.4% of Polysorbate 80 or around 15.4% of Polysorbate 20.\n\n# Ethanol (Alcohol)\n\nSalicylic Acid is highly soluble in **Ethanol**, that's why many companies use Ethanol as a main solvent or a co-solvent of the product.\n\nUnder normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg Ethanol, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Propylene glycol\n\n**Propylene Glycol** is often used as a solvent and penetration enhancer in skincare formulations. Solubility rate of SA in Propylene Glycol is 248.63 g/L or 257.64 g/kg Propylene Glycol, which means 25.76g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Propylene Glycol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Sodium Citrate and Sodium Lactate\n\n**Sodium Citrate** and **Sodium Lactate** are salts of weak Citric Acid and Lactic Acid respectfully. Since SA is a stronger acid, when mixed it can replace Citric or Lactic acid and gives **Sodium Salicylate**, which is highly soluble in water:\n\n>Sodium Citrate + Salicylic Acid -> Sodium Citrate + Sodium Salicylate + Citric Acid + Salicylic Acid\n\nMentioned salts are not usable as solubilization enhancers since they basically neutralize SA, but they are good buffering agents to prevent SA recrystallization in case of pH drift or temperature change.\n\nSuggested ratio of salt to SA is 1:10 ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/precipitation-and-gel-incompatibility-salicylic-acid-serum/)), meaning for 2% of Salicylic Acid include 0.2% of the buffer.\n\n# Mixed solvency approach\n\nAccording to [Hydrotropy, mixed hydrotropy, and mixed solvency as trending concept for solubilization of lipophilic drugs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128144558000050) and [\"Mixed-solvency approach\" - Boon for solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44298504_Mixed-solvency_approach_-_Boon_for_solubilization_of_poorly_water-soluble_drugs), a mix of different solvents usually gives better solubility than if one pure solvent is used of the same content. This allows to decrease the content of each individual solvent in the formula leading to a more elegant product.\n\nSolubility in mixes of Water, Propylene Glycol and Ethanol was studied in [Solubility prediction of Salicylic Acid in Water-Ethanol-Propylene Glycol mixtures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16649546/). The study defined a formula to determine how much Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in a custom mixture of this solvents and also proves mixed solvency approach.\n\nHere is a calculator spreadsheet that I made based on the study: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqJaMGAa1Wu3BKck55dkqUWt4ACU_FPo). Fill in percentage of Ethanol and Propylene Glycol in the mixture (water will be calculated automatically) and you'll see the solubility calculated.\n\n# Substitutions\n\nThere are alternative ingredients that are readily soluble in water and can be used to avoid the hassle with Salicylic Acid itself:\n\n* **Sodium Salicylate**. Salt of Salicylic Acid. Very soluble in water. There is a publication in cosmetic journal ([Exfoliation for sensitive skin with neutralized salicylic acid](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x)) showing that Sodium Salicylate is as effective as actual Salicylic Acid in terms of exfoliation. But the methodology of studies are not disclosed and anti-acne effect is not tested. Used in [Revox Just Salicylic Acid 2% For Scalp](https://incidecoder.com/products/revox-just-salicylic-acid-2-for-scalp)  and [Keve Salicylic Acid 2% Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/keve-salicylic-acid-2-serum)\n* **WIllow Bark Extract**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Pyunkang Yul Acne Dressing Mask Pack](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-dressing-mask-pack);\n* **Betaine Salicylate**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Cos De BAHA S2 Salicylic Acid BHA 2% Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cos-de-baha-s2-salicylic-acid-bha-2-liquid);\n* **Salicylic Acid in Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine** solution. Used in [The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution)  and [Revolution 2% Salicylic Acid Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/revolution-2-salicylic-acid-serum);\n* Spray dried **Salicylic Acid with Acacia Senegal Gum**. Used in [Somethinc 2% BHA Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment](https://incidecoder.com/products/somethinc-2-bha-salicylic-acid-acne-treatment) and [Attivi Puri Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/attivi-puri-salicylic-acid-niacinamide-lotion)\n\n# Formulation strategy\n\nBased on the data above, the strategy of formulating a stable SA serum is:\n\n1. Formulate with not more than 2% of Salicylic Acid to meet requirements for skincare products;\n2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. At this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed);\n3. Use several solvents (glycols, ethanol) for better solubility based on mixed solvency approach;\n4. Include some mild non-ionic surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to form micelles and encapsulate part of the acid;\n5. Use Betaine to convert part of SA to Betaine Salicylate and adjust the pH;\n6. Add some weak acid salt (Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate) to prevent precipitation in case of pH drift or temperature change;\n7. Since our target is low pH, maybe Ethanol content and maybe high salt content be sure to use a tolerant gelling agent. Sepimax Zen, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose or HMW Hyaluronic acid are good choices, while Aristoflex, Carbomer, Lecigel won't thicken the solution.\n8. Avoid natural extracts (or add at 0.01% amount for marketing claims) and ingredients that in low pH will hydrolyze over time and shift the pH level up (Niacinamide, Urea etc).\n\n# Example of a commercial product\n\n[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n* Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n* Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n* Used Betaine as a hydrotrope tp boost the solubility;\n* Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\n# Example of formulas\n\n# Very basic waterless solution\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Propylene Glycol|98%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n\nThe easiest and fastest approach is to dissolve Salicylic Acid directly in Propylene Glycol.\n\nPros:\n\n* No water - no solubility and recrystallization problems;\n* No water - no pH;\n* No water - no need for preservation;\n* Easy and fast to prepare;\n* Damn strong since whole SA content is in free acid form.\n\nCons:\n\n* Unpleasant to wear, PG has very oily texture (can be balanced with Ethanol to some degree);\n* Runny texture, hard to thicken;\n* Damn strong. Yes, it is not a typo, this can be both - advantage and disadvantage.\n\n# Basic one-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Optional: preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Propylene Glycol|50%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. Mix Salicylic Acid with Propylene Glycol until it is completely dissolved;\n2. Add Sodium Hydroxide solution and water;\n3. Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n4. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n5. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nPreservative is optional because the formula has a lot of humectant (Propylene Glycol) that binds water and also low pH.\n\nUsed much more PG as required because no other co-solvents or buffering agents used, so higher amount is required to maintain the stability and prevent recrystallization of SA.\n\n# Basic two-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Ethanol|20%|\n|Propylene Glycol|20%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

        "body": "A great comprehensive view! I have a few comments/corrections/additions. Feel free to disregard them :)\n\n>Under normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nI would add \"**g/kg ethanol**\", otherwise this can be confused with g/kg solution (which is the more common use of the unit). \n\n>2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. Under this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed)\n\nAs you decrease pH, more acid will be in the free-acid form (that is, protonated). However, above pH 3.5, you'll reduce the amount of free acid (increase the ionized form). It should be updated to read \"**Above** this pH, if you add...\".\n\n>4. Include some mild surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to decrease surface tension and boost the solubility;\n\nI don't see that the article comments on the mechanism of solubilization. However, the likely mechanism would be somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation. Surfactants decreasing air-water interfacial surface tension is an intrinsic property of surfactants, and doesn't really pertain to boosting solubility. It's a nit-picky suggestion, but it's just because I work with surfactants.\n\n>[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n>1. Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n\n>2. Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n\n>3. Used Betaine as pH adjuster;\n\n>4. Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\nBetaine (also called N,N,N-trimethylglycine) isn't a pH adjuster because it's largely zwitterionic in solution, and has a pKa of around 2.33, and so won't be appreciably protonated (i.e. taking up protons to buffer the solution) until after you've protonated a >50% of the salicylic acid. However, triethanolamine is a pH adjuster, and will form a small amount of triethanolammonium salicylate (which does increase solubility, albeit by neutralization). \n\n  \nAll in all, a lot of great, helpful information! Thanks for putting this together!",

SLES is like... a lesser demon. (SLS = Sodium Lauryl Sulfate,  SLES = Sodium Laureth Sulfate)\n\n* Gave no-poo a very short attempt and couldn't stand the smell no matter how much no-poo advocates insist it won't smell (I believe that their hair doesn't smell because bodies are all different, but my hair obviously did).\n\n* Most no-poo shampoo or conditioner alternatives I've seen suggested are either straight-up bad or extremely questionable (apple cider vinegar, baking soda, etc.)  I'm open to wacky alternatives but I want to know they're not going to fuck my shit up.\n\n* Every conditioner I can find that doesn't have fatty alcohols has coconut oil and/or olive oil (both of which honestly I've never put on my skin because I'm terrified of them).\n\n* I could live without a conditioner if I could find a super gentle shampoo, but that's basically what I'm trying to accomplish with the co-washing (a \"super-gentle shampoo\").

Also, as far as no-poo. I thought it was horrible too at first. My hair smelled like a dead skunk after a few days. The solution is to use conditioner every day you wash it, as well as leave-in conditioner every single day. But the secret ingredient, is dry shampoo. Its a bit expensive, but you dont need much. A bottle of spray last me about 6 months. Now my hair smells great.\n\nFinally, as far as the coloring, remember to take extra care of your hair. Unfortunately I made the mistake of fucking up and never taking care of it. Now its all dry, poofy, and awful. Im probably going to just cut it off once i have enough replacement hair. You can buy some oils to put in your hair, but only do it once a week, since you already arent washing it!\n\nNow as far as actual shampoo, I would recommend baby shampoo, but it can be a bit expensive. However, if you do decide to go the no-poo method, any shampoo will do, as you will only be shampooing in the shower every so often.\n\nMy suggestions may seem redundant since I told you my hair is awful, but that was not due to my regime, but due to the fact that I used the straightener way to much and I fried my hair.\n\nHope this helps",
