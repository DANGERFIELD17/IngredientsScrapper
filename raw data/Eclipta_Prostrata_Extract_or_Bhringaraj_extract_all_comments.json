    "body": "I think it’s a good idea to list all of the newly reformulated sunscreens of the failed Korean sunscreens. The new formulas look promising and many of the brands are being extra careful this time with independent testing, so we can be 100% confident that these sunscreens are the labeled SPF. I will list the sunscreens that I have came across that have been reformulated. If I missed any, leave them in the comments below.\n\n1.) ***Round Lab Birch Juice Sun Cream***\n\n* **Old version:**\n\n1. Manufacturer: Green Cos\n2. UV Filters (2):  Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S\n3.

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna.

The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

I got the BoJ green plum cleanser in my shower and the Skin1004 on my sink. The BoJ is a gel type cleanser, reminds me of Pyunkang Acne facial cleanser. Despite being a gel, it is non stripping. BoJ left my skin hydrated actually. While Skin1004 is a cream foam cleanser. It is a basic foam cleanser but made my skin smoother and fresh. It didn’t feel tight, but it feels like it’s going to be drying if I don’t immediately follow up with a toner. Other than that, I think it’s also a great cleanser especially for double cleanse.

And It didn’t disappoint. It’s very moisturizing, it’s texture is almost like a mayonnaise.  My skin loves it as it seeps easily into the skin, and leaves no greasy or oily feel.  It’s so smooth that it glides easily into the skin. There’s zero fragrance and it makes my skin feel both moisturized and hydrated.\n\nI have been using It as a Night Cream, as PM is a good time to use hydrating and barrier repairing products. It stays true to its hydration claims, but I saw no effect on my pigmentation nor did it reduce tiny bumps on my skin (like Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel). I didn’t see any glow, but it did make my skin look healthy.\n\nAs someone with Combination skin, bit towards the oilier side, it’s so difficult to find a moisturizer that moisturizes without any greasiness or without feeling heavy on your skin, and also not inviting new acne post application. This was a Chef’s kiss. So worth the hype, but not worth the price. \n\n\n**WRP:** Unless I get it again at a cheaper thrift price, WNRP. It is a great product, but 3000 bucks for a 60ml cream is too expensive. But if you’re someone who can afford it, go for it.",

Has a protective inner lid, but no spatula.\n\nScent: Hard to describe! It’s like a wheaty scent, which I like.\n\nTexture: Very thick texture, like a balm that doesn’t really spread well on the skin. It’s a bit too “solid”\n\nReason for purchase: I really liked the ingredient list as it contained a lot of nutrients my skin needs such as peptides, ceramide, niacinamide, squalene… etc. Reviews were also encouraging.\n\nSeason for intended use: Winter\n\nFrequency & place in routine: Daily in the PM moisturizer step\n\nLength of use: several months\n\nExperience: I’ll start off by saying that this is not the best product out there. It was on sale when I bought it, so I wanted to take a chance. It’s not worth it. It’s too difficult to spread on the skin, requires a lot of pulling and if you warm it up in your hands, it doesn’t transfer well, but just kinds of clings to your hands. It does NOT absorb. Like at all. It is so incredibly sticky and greasy, and I have dry skin. That is why I could not use it in the AM, and I even ruined a couple of pillowcases because of it. Of note, it did absolutely nothing for dehydration. The only one small redeeming point is that when using it immediately after an AHA exfoliator, it does help to soften the skin and restore nutrition. I do not recommend for any skin type.\n\nRepurchase: No\n\nOverall Score (1 lowest, 5 highest): 1/5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vikhq4avrrkc1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4b480c7eceadbe0c6529027deb6ff27d9bd4f58\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask (50 ml)**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, GLYCERETH-26, PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, BEHENYL ALCOHOL, POLYMETHYLSILSESQUIOXANE, CHLORELLA VULGARIS EXTRACT, GLUCOSE, CARBOMER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, FRUCTOOLIGOSACCHARIDES, FRUCTOSE, HIPPOPHAE RHAMNOIDES OIL, TROMETHAMINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, CITRUS JUNOS PEEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, DISODIUM EDTA, ECLIPTA PROSTRATA EXTRACT, ECLIPTA PROSTRATA LEAF EXTRACT, CITRUS JUNOS SEED OIL, MORINGA OLEIFERA SEED OIL, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, CHOLESTEROL, PEG-800, ASCORBIC ACID, TOCOPHEROL, POLYSORBATE 20, CERAMIDE NP, LINOLEIC ACID, RETINOL, CITRUS JUNOS FRUIT OIL, BIOFLAVONOIDS, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-22, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-45, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-8, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9.\n\nPlace of purchase: SokoGlam\n\nPrice of purchase: $20.3 USD\n\nPackaging: Cute yuzu-inspired jar that comes with a spatula and inner lid. It’s a bit too much packaging for a small amount of product, though. \n\nScent: Yuzu scent (surprise!)\n\nTexture: Complex, lol! It has this nice gel-like texture that actually looks like yuzu jello, with PULP inside it. It has these little particles that are reminiscent of Yuzu peel. They disappear upon application.\n\nReason for purchase: I wanted to try a sleeping mask and really liked that this one had Vitamin C, retinol and ceramides. Seemed like it would help with both dehydration and hyperpigmentation.\n\nSeason for use: Year-round\n\nFrequency & place in routine: Sleep mask to replace PM moisturizer, once or twice a week.\n\nLength of use: several months\n\nExperience: The scent, packaging and texture of this product make it a very pleasurable experience to use! It’s so refreshing and I enjoyed using it. However, it was not hydrating enough, despite the gel-like texture – it does not protect from dehydration overnight unfortunately. Although it does make my skin a bit more supple the day after. Perhaps I needed to use it daily to see effects? One thing I did not like was that it does leave a sticky and tacky feeling after application. I’m giving 3/5 because I think it might be very good for oily, combination and normal skin types.\n\nRepurchase: No\n\nOverall Score (1 lowest, 5 highest): 3/5",

That might be why you didn't find it hydrating, but also of course, it might just not work for you! I use it over the dynasty cream 1-3 times a week and I can always notice a difference when I wake up, but it is one of my favourite products so again, everyone's different!",

    "body": "Hi!\n\nI'm attempting a ✨similar but different ✨ dupe to the Glow Recipe Niacinamide Dew Drops. I wanted to change out the watermelon for green tea and other ingredients but what I'm trying to emulate is the brightening and balancing properties of the Niacinamide with intense glow. The ingredient list is as follows:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Propanediol, Glycereth-26, Glycerin, Niacinamide, 2,3-Butanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Citrullus Lanatus Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Eclipta Prostrata Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Tromethamine, Glyceryl Stearate, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Polyquaternium-51, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Fragrance/Parfum, Benzyl Benzoate.\n\nWhile I like what I've made, it's definitely not as glowy as I would like. I'm wondering if the addition of cyclomethicone is where I went wrong? I wanted some added slip and to take down some tackiness but I'm wondering if it's creating too much of a dry down? Also, I know my ratio of oil to Aristoflex is high but shockingly it has stayed stable! I made it a little over a week ago and no issues so far, but it's a little thicker than I'd want. Here's my recipe:\n\n5% Niacinamide\n5% Licorice Root\n7% Green Tea Extract\n1% Calendula Extract\n10% Squalane\n1% Aristoflex AVC\n2%B5 dissolved\n8% Glycerine\n7% Hyaluronic Acid\n2% Cyclomethicone\n.5% Liquid Germall Plus\n8.5% Aloe Juice\n40% Distilled Water\n\nAny theories would help!

I am also curious if you’re using a hyaluronic acid solution at 7% or what exactly that 7% is. Although I am personally a fan of Aristoflex AVC, it might be helpful to take that out and just use a Hyaluronic Acid HMW powder maybe .5%-.75% and let that gel, also include .15%-.2% xanthan gum/glycerin slurry (and then adjust the viscosity as needed with salt to thicken if necessary, but most likely won’t need to at all). You could also reduce Squalane slightly and add another oil in addition to help with the glow you’re looking for. Sunflower oil is nice ;)",

    "body": "Product: Peach & Lily Pore Proof Perfecting Clay Mask\n\nProduct Size: 80 ML/2.70 OZ\n\nConsistency Of Product: Thick Clay Based Wash-Off Style Mask\n\nStart Date Of Product: August 19th 2019\n\nWhen I Use It: Evening Routine - Twice Per Week\n\nHow I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Using the included spatula…I apply a large almond sized amount of Product onto my fingers. Then, I gently swipe/apply the Mask onto the left side of my Face…making sure to get an even layer of Product on. Then, I repeat the process to the right side. Finally, I use some additional Product to fill in any areas that seem too thin as well as bring a bit of Product down to my neck area. After 15-30 minutes…I rinse the Product off with lukewarm water.\n\nWhy I Use It: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Not that I have to make this disclaimer to you all by now…but if you don’t know I absolutely love Peach & Lily. Alicia Yoon’s passion for Skincare and battling with her own Skin issues makes me really trust her and her team. And the Products speak for themselves…there hasn’t been a single one that I haven’t loved in some way LOL! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Having said that…the three Products that launched last month were not quite what I was expecting from the Brand. We got a Night Cream, Eye Cream (or stick I guess I should say), and a Clay Mask. I was kind of bummed to not see an Oil Based Cleanser of some kind…and I’m constantly praying for Peach & Lily or Glow Recipe to FINALLY launch a Sunscreen. But anyway…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Of course, I picked up all three LOL! But, I ended up starting with the Clay Mask because I needed to incorporate one back into my Routine. In addition, and its something we will get to…I was just kind of surprised by the pricing for this Product. I don’t think I have ever payed this much for a Clay Mask…and honestly haven’t seen many this expensive outside of some higher end/prestige Brands. But, I had to give it a try!\n\nOverall Review:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Right away…the packaging of this Product really impressed me. From the brightly colored box to the simple yet elegant glass jar…I just loved this presentation so much. Peach & Lily does a great job with their glass packaging and I wish they would bring it to more of their Product Range. From this packaging, its easy to see the really interesting pink/rose hue of the Clay Mask itself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What makes that color so unique is that its totally natural…no synthetic dyes are used here. Calamine (yes…like the Lotion LOL) makes it fairly high on the Ingredients List which is what I assume helps to give this Product its unique color. In addition…Kaolin, Wild Cherry Extract, Strawberry Extract, Chinaberry Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Panthenol, Licorice Root Extract, Skullcap Root Extract, and Fall Daisy Extract all make it into the Formula. You’ll also find some various texturizes, preservatives, and yes…Essential Oils in the mix as well. In addition to no Synthetic Dyes…Peach & Lily formulates their Products without Synthetic Fragrance or Silicones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* One of the things that I noticed with my first few applications of this Clay Mask was just how smooth and even feeling the texture was. Some other Clay Masks I have used in the past have a slight “chunky” feeling or grit to them. This Pore Proof Perfecting Clay Mask goes on incredibly evenly and feels super comfortable on the Skin. I felt like I was able to get a really even/consistent layer of Product on without any hassle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I found that I needed much less Product per application than I normally would with a Clay Mask because this stuff DOES NOT DRY OUT! Usually, I try to go pretty thick with a Clay Mask to avoid that “cracked desert” feel for as long as I can. I try to keep a Clay Mask on for 15-20 minutes…so using enough Product to keep everything damp in that time means I burn through Clay Masks pretty fast LOL. With this Mask from Peach & Lily…even after 20 minutes its still fairly soft and doest feel like its trying to tear my face off! This is honestly one of the most comfortable Clay Masks I have ever used. Its totally easy to talk, make facial expression, and even sip some water with this Mask on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Just like some of my other favorite Clay Masks…consistent use of this Product left my Skin feeling more soft than usual and my oil/sebum production appeared more normalized. I love how the “purifying” effects of Kaolin can really help to balance the Skin. But, this Clay Mask from Peach & Lily takes it a couple steps further by adding the calming/anti-inflammatory Calamine as well as anti-oxidant/Vitamin-C rich Extracts. I loved how my Skin looked and felt so much more soothed after using this Mask.\n\nI’m sure you can guess…I loved this Product so much LOL! It really is a great Clay Mask that has been taken to a whole new level with the added Hero Ingredients. For me, it was incredibly effective while still being gentle. This isn’t a Clay Mask that you need a pressure washer to remove…it easily rinses away. The scent is very faint but the Cherry and Strawberry come though enough to give this Product a refreshing quality.\n\nPersonally, I think I would be more than willing to come back to this Clay Mask and make it my new go-to. But, at $43.00 USD…I don’t think this Product is one that I could recommend for EVERYONE. If you are new to the world of Clay Masks, K-Beauty, or just Skincare in general…I think there are some really decent options that are priced far less. I would suggest trying out a Product like the Neogen Canadian Clay Pore Mask (great for Oily Skin Types with excess Sebum), the Skinfood Bitter Green Clay Soothing Mask (great for Sensitive/Irritated Skin), or the Pure Heals Volcanic Pore Clay Mask (great for a broad range of Skin Types). Each of those options really did well with my Skin and were more affordable. \n\nHaving said all of that, if you are looking for one of the best Clay Masks that covers so much more than a traditional Mask (in my opinion)…the Pore Proof Perfecting Clay Mask from Peach & Lily is a worthy splurge.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Bentonite, Calamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Betaine, Kaolin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Prunus Serotina (Wild Cherry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Panthenol, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Eclipta Prostrata Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Chlorphenesin, Xanthan Gum, Quartz, Citric Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Oil\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/muo2rezysoo41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b922e371eac7830503b68c3337c64edb797b811d",

    "body": "Hello! My original skin concerns and why I wanted to start a skincare routine are dry skin with redness on my cheeks, nose, and chin. Occasionally I get a pimple or two before my period, mostly along my jawline but sometimes cheeks and nose. I've been testing out some products mostly trying to find a moisturizer first but I've had reactions to quite a few things and I'm looking for help narrowing down ingredients to avoid in my further purchases. I'm considering I might have [oral allergy syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_allergy_syndrome) which might explain the issue with honey (although I can eat honey and don't seem to have a problem with it.... I sometimes have issues with avocado, grapes, watermelon, bananas, and almonds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**OLD ROUTINE**(that I do not do anymore - did not seem to have adverse reactions with):\n\n\n**am**\n\n* Whatever body lotion I'm using at the time as a face moisturizer(contains fragrance and glycerin)\n\n\n* Sometimes use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen spf 55 (diligent if I was going to be outside, nothing if I knew I would be inside)\n\n\n*Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 2.8%, Oxybenzone 6%\n\nWater, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Styrene/acrylates Copolymer, Silica, Diethylhexyl 2,6- Naphthalate, Vp/hexadecane Copolymer, Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Peg-100 Stearate, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Methylparaben, Behenyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate*\n\n\n* Sometimes makeup, never had to worry about ingredients or seemed to have any reactions to foundations, etc.\n\n\n\n\n**PM**\n\n* Hot shower\n\n\n* CeRave Renewing SA Cleanser (at most 2x a week, usually the night before I would be wearing makeup, scrubbing with a loofah to physically exfoliate otherwise I would have my foundation stick to my dry patches)\n\n\n*Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Niacinamide, Gluconolactone, Sodium Methylcocoyl Taurate, Peg-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Salicylic Acid, Ceramide I6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Benzoate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Disodium Edta, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide.*\n\n\n\n* Whatever body lotion I'm using at the time as a face moisturizer, contains fragrance and glycerin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**New products I've tried:**\n\n(When testing these I was simply using water to wash my face, and the **single product** I was testing, AM and PM. **NOT ALL USED IN A ROUTINE TOGETHER**. I would usually get a reaction within a day-a few days)\n\n\n**AM&PM**\n\n\n* Wash face with water\n\n* Use the single product I'm testing\n\n\nRepeat, and change the product I'm testing every few days-a week. I would get a reaction pretty early on which is why I wouldn't test for longer.\n\n\n\n\n* **CosRx Honey Ceramide Full Moisture Cream**\n\n*Honey extract, butylene glycol, glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, beeswax, elaeis guineesis (palm) kernel oil, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, hordeum vulgare leaf extract, cetearyl alcohol, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, ceramide 3, xanthan gum, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, adenosine*\n\n**Reaction**: Seemed great until the ~3rd day, small skin colored bumps mostly on forehead and cheeks.

Any tips? Can anyone wth more ingredient knowledge help me out? Thanks so much! I'm just trying to moisturize my dumb dry skin and feeling helpless that I'm making it worse :( I don't understand why I've never had to be careful before with lotion especially and now that I'm putting effort into getting facial products I'm having reactions. \n\n\nEdited for formatting.",

    "body": "Product: Peach & Lily Pore Proof Perfecting Clay Mask\n\nProduct Size: 80 ML/2.70 OZ\n\nConsistency Of Product: Thick Clay Based Wash-Off Style Mask\n\nStart Date Of Product: August 19th 2019\n\nWhen I Use It: Evening Routine - Twice Per Week\n\nHow I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Using the included spatula…I apply a large almond sized amount of Product onto my fingers. Then, I gently swipe/apply the Mask onto the left side of my Face…making sure to get an even layer of Product on. Then, I repeat the process to the right side. Finally, I use some additional Product to fill in any areas that seem too thin as well as bring a bit of Product down to my neck area. After 15-30 minutes…I rinse the Product off with lukewarm water.\n\nWhy I Use It: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Not that I have to make this disclaimer to you all by now…but if you don’t know I absolutely love Peach & Lily. Alicia Yoon’s passion for Skincare and battling with her own Skin issues makes me really trust her and her team. And the Products speak for themselves…there hasn’t been a single one that I haven’t loved in some way LOL! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Having said that…the three Products that launched last month were not quite what I was expecting from the Brand. We got a Night Cream, Eye Cream (or stick I guess I should say), and a Clay Mask. I was kind of bummed to not see an Oil Based Cleanser of some kind…and I’m constantly praying for Peach & Lily or Glow Recipe to FINALLY launch a Sunscreen. But anyway…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Of course, I picked up all three LOL! But, I ended up starting with the Clay Mask because I needed to incorporate one back into my Routine. In addition, and its something we will get to…I was just kind of surprised by the pricing for this Product. I don’t think I have ever payed this much for a Clay Mask…and honestly haven’t seen many this expensive outside of some higher end/prestige Brands. But, I had to give it a try!\n\nOverall Review:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Right away…the packaging of this Product really impressed me. From the brightly colored box to the simple yet elegant glass jar…I just loved this presentation so much. Peach & Lily does a great job with their glass packaging and I wish they would bring it to more of their Product Range. From this packaging, its easy to see the really interesting pink/rose hue of the Clay Mask itself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What makes that color so unique is that its totally natural…no synthetic dyes are used here. Calamine (yes…like the Lotion LOL) makes it fairly high on the Ingredients List which is what I assume helps to give this Product its unique color. In addition…Kaolin, Wild Cherry Extract, Strawberry Extract, Chinaberry Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Panthenol, Licorice Root Extract, Skullcap Root Extract, and Fall Daisy Extract all make it into the Formula. You’ll also find some various texturizes, preservatives, and yes…Essential Oils in the mix as well. In addition to no Synthetic Dyes…Peach & Lily formulates their Products without Synthetic Fragrance or Silicones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* One of the things that I noticed with my first few applications of this Clay Mask was just how smooth and even feeling the texture was. Some other Clay Masks I have used in the past have a slight “chunky” feeling or grit to them. This Pore Proof Perfecting Clay Mask goes on incredibly evenly and feels super comfortable on the Skin. I felt like I was able to get a really even/consistent layer of Product on without any hassle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I found that I needed much less Product per application than I normally would with a Clay Mask because this stuff DOES NOT DRY OUT! Usually, I try to go pretty thick with a Clay Mask to avoid that “cracked desert” feel for as long as I can. I try to keep a Clay Mask on for 15-20 minutes…so using enough Product to keep everything damp in that time means I burn through Clay Masks pretty fast LOL. With this Mask from Peach & Lily…even after 20 minutes its still fairly soft and doest feel like its trying to tear my face off! This is honestly one of the most comfortable Clay Masks I have ever used. Its totally easy to talk, make facial expression, and even sip some water with this Mask on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Just like some of my other favorite Clay Masks…consistent use of this Product left my Skin feeling more soft than usual and my oil/sebum production appeared more normalized. I love how the “purifying” effects of Kaolin can really help to balance the Skin. But, this Clay Mask from Peach & Lily takes it a couple steps further by adding the calming/anti-inflammatory Calamine as well as anti-oxidant/Vitamin-C rich Extracts. I loved how my Skin looked and felt so much more soothed after using this Mask.\n\nI’m sure you can guess…I loved this Product so much LOL! It really is a great Clay Mask that has been taken to a whole new level with the added Hero Ingredients. For me, it was incredibly effective while still being gentle. This isn’t a Clay Mask that you need a pressure washer to remove…it easily rinses away. The scent is very faint but the Cherry and Strawberry come though enough to give this Product a refreshing quality.\n\nPersonally, I think I would be more than willing to come back to this Clay Mask and make it my new go-to. But, at $43.00 USD…I don’t think this Product is one that I could recommend for EVERYONE. If you are new to the world of Clay Masks, K-Beauty, or just Skincare in general…I think there are some really decent options that are priced far less. I would suggest trying out a Product like the Neogen Canadian Clay Pore Mask (great for Oily Skin Types with excess Sebum), the Skinfood Bitter Green Clay Soothing Mask (great for Sensitive/Irritated Skin), or the Pure Heals Volcanic Pore Clay Mask (great for a broad range of Skin Types). Each of those options really did well with my Skin and were more affordable. \n\nHaving said all of that, if you are looking for one of the best Clay Masks that covers so much more than a traditional Mask (in my opinion)…the Pore Proof Perfecting Clay Mask from Peach & Lily is a worthy splurge.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Bentonite, Calamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Betaine, Kaolin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Prunus Serotina (Wild Cherry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Panthenol, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Eclipta Prostrata Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Chlorphenesin, Xanthan Gum, Quartz, Citric Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Oil\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z20wzqrpsoo41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c93fbb64f6cd67b2f8c705c27652eb041ba6f12",

Occasionally I get a pimple or two before my period, mostly along my jawline but sometimes cheeks and nose.

I'm considering I might have [oral allergy syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_allergy_syndrome) which might explain the issue with honey (although I can eat honey and don't seem to have a problem with it....

Honey, glycerin, HA, & snail mucin fall under that category.\n\nHumectants (If i remember correctly) can be tricky if you: live in a dry environment or use it on a dry face bc it won't have moisture to draw from. I'm guessing it's fine in your cleanser bc you rinse it off right away but your sunscreen doesnt seem to have any so maybe look for humectant- free products to hydrate your skin? Green tea, aloe, rose, etc might be better nourishing ingredients to look for? \n\nEdit: also for whenever you can find a good moisturizer, I hear vanicream's cleanser is really gentle! I don't have dry skin so those cleansers are too thick for me but that or Fresh Soy Cleanser could be options!",

It’s not a bad thing at all, silicones are exactly what you need for a heat protectant. But considering that protein overload is also build up I’d make sure your shampoo has decently strong surfactants (or use a clarifying shampoo periodically).\n\nI’m gonna ask a bit of an unsolicited question, apologies if you’re not open to it, definitely just ignore it if that’s the case. Are you sure your hair is low porosity? Usually bleached hair is always high porosity (or at least medium) because of the chemical process involved.",

    "body": "I recently turned 30 and while I kind of look young I definitely have not taken care of my skin and its starting to show unless I hide under a ton of makeup and not make any extreme facial expressions. \n\nI touch my face, rub my eyes, pick at my face, pull my eyes to apply makeup, don't wash my makeup off, use old makeup, don't use the correct soap or lotion, and have a pretty bad furrow in my brow from making angry faces and a ton of laugh lines because my husband is hilarious. I have wrinkles under my slightly dark puffy eyes, dry forehead, oily chin, etc etc. \n\nRight now I'm using a very very soft bristled brush with a flower petal shape bunch of bristles and the middle bristle bunch is shorter. I'm using Simple Truth Organic Lavender Orange Facial Cleanser, but it seems to really dry out my skin and isn't great at taking off my eye makeup. I end up scrubbing my eyes with a dry towel trying to get mascara off which I know is really bad. I also have eczema on my forehead/hairline that comes and goes.\n\nThen I use Morgan Miller Rose Hip Oil and apply it lightly with a beauty sponge at night or before makeup.\n\nI use Rico Baby Wipes with calendula to wipe my face in the morning or to try to get off makeup, but am probably too rough.\n\nI like to online shop and I love a good deal so I got three skincare packages of fancy stuff and I've been researching and creating charts for a few hours but I am at a bit of a loss.\n\nI don't want to put this stuff on wrong and fuck my skin up as I think I have sensitive skin.\n\nOk so here is what I got, what the site says what the stuff is for, and so far what I think the order should be. Some steps I have a few different products of but not sure what ingredients shouldn't be used together or maybe what is better?\n\nThanks!\n\n**^MORNING**\n\n* MURAD Renewing Eye Cream 0.5 oz\n* \n* PRIVATE DOCTOR Define Minus Serum 1.35 oz\n* \n* INC.REDIBLE COSMETICS Hemp Hydrating Lip Jelly 4 ml\n* \n* ORIGINS Original Skin™ Matte Moisturizer With Willowherb 15 ml\n* \n* PURLISSE BEAUTY Pineapple Bright Brightening Cleansing Gel 1 oz\n* \n* COMPLEX CULTURE Sonic T-Bar Facial Massager\n* \n* SCENTUALS Vitamin C Facial Serum 60 ml\n* \n* TATCHA Dewy Skin Cream 10 ml\n\n**^What ^It ^Does:**\n\nMURAD Renewing Eye Cream is a hydrating eye treatment that helps brighten, minimize fine lines, and reduce puffiness in one step.

The sulfate-free formula gently removes build-up and grime, while camu camu improves uneven texture, and pineapple extract (loaded with vitamin C) helps brighten your skin tone.\n\nCOMPLEX CULTURE Sonic T-Bar Facial Massager is a sonic-powered tool that delivers a modern facial massage to increase blood flow, reduce puffiness, relieve facial tension, and help tone facial contours.

Retinol is the most effective way to even the skin and reduce wrinkles and spots. \nAvoid any products with alcohol denat (so most toners and astringents) and exfoliants.",
