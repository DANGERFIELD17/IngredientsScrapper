    "body": "We‚Äôve lived in this neighborhood for 15 years now, and the HOA board (like many) is mostly made up of the grouchy old people who have too much time on their hands. Sometimes it‚Äôs fine for a while and then someone new takes over and has some vendetta to pursue. I guess we were due for the pendulum to swing.\n\nOur front yard has a few big trees and is thus entirely in the shade. We‚Äôve tried to plant grass seed a few times but there‚Äôs just not enough sun for grass to thrive, so it‚Äôs mostly low ground cover - no idea what kind, but it‚Äôs green and we keep it mowed. For 13 years this was fine.\n\nThen last year, we got a nastygram from the HOA - we had WEEDS! According to the bylaws, we needed to prove we were using chemical lawn treatments to kill anything that‚Äôs not grass. Crucially, the rules don‚Äôt require us to hire a weed control company (although that‚Äôs what they expected) - we just had to provide proof in the form of a receipt for money spent.\n\nMy lovely, petty spouse went on Amazon and ordered a $6 spray bottle of the most woo-woo new age homeopathic ‚Äúweedkiller‚Äù she could find. I think the main ingredient was lavender oil. We dutifully spritzed the yard a few times, sent an action shot and a copy of the digital receipt, and thanked them for their concern.\n\nThe lavender oil, shockingly, did nothing. We didn‚Äôt actually have to kill the weeds, though, just try. We‚Äôve heard nothing from the HOA since‚Ä¶ and the front yard still has almost no grass.",

\n\nme: i have lived here over three years.  no pesticides or herbicides have been used here since we bought the house.  the dandelions are organically grown herbs.  \n\ncertified organic is a trademark requiring significant investment to acquire.  i‚Äôm not selling produce so i‚Äôm not looking for certification. \n\nstill i think we should have you evaluated.   he said. \n\nofficer, on main street, south of here is a natural foods store.  all their produce is organic.  dandelions were over five dollars a pound last week when i shopped there. \n\njust because i have a neighbor who thinks it‚Äôs odd, why should i have to prove mental competency because i prefer to consume what i‚Äôve grown here, instead of buying it in the store? \n\nwhat‚Äôs next?  a complaint that i eat beets or asparagus?\n\nunless you have a criminal code issue to discuss with me, please tell my neighbor to be less nosy. \n\nthey left. \n\na couple months later was when we took down the trees/bushes on the north side  but only the ones whose roots looked like they were or would threaten the building.  \n\nthat we heard about from our neighbor to the north.  they liked the view.  they wanted to control our property to maintain their view.  they didn‚Äôt want to pay for that‚Ä¶ they could have bought it when it went on the market.  it was openly being sold for a month or two before we toured.  \n\nthey ended up planting similar but far from their building‚Ä¶ closer to the property line actually \n\nthe third and final event was a letter from the city code enforcement.  it said we had weeds and gave a deadline to remove them or they would send a team on our property to spray and they would charge us for the team. \n\ni wrote back - certified return receipt.  i noted that weed is not defined.  their demand to resolve weeds by deadline was vague and ambiguous.  and i put them on notice that they were not allowed to trespass on my property for any reason including inspections, and that if they sent a team not only would i not pay their invoice but i would sue them and the city for the cost of my organic supplements for the next ten years.  and i promised i would prevail.  \n\nfurthermore, i noted that i‚Äôm a student of herbal medicine and that God generally plants everything i would need within three blocks of my home.  \n\nwhat grows that you don‚Äôt plant is called ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù by horticultural professionals.  \n\ngiven that i do have the legal right to harvest on my land, and my parcel was not three blocks radius in size, i made it clear that my plan was to harvest the volunteers on my land in their correct season and time of day for maximum potency - including the thistles.  \n\nit is up to us to learn the medicinal use of the plants around us.  clearly something the complaining neighbor did not do.  \n\nthe city never wrote back.  and when i met their code enforcement officer on neutral ground he refused to speak with me.  i suspect no one has ever demanded he write exactly what is being deemed a weed and what code it violated before.  \n\ni did harvest everything eventually.  but on the plants schedule not theirs.  and i kept them and prepared them for use.  \n\nwear gloves when handling thistles, folks!!\n\nwe had a small patch of chives that became dominant in our yard.  i like chives.  i loved seeing their purple blossoms.  they‚Äôre edible too!  \n\ni‚Äôm thinking of my next home having a green/living roof cover‚Ä¶ and i‚Äôm thinking chives‚Ä¶",

    "body": "So this fuck up actually happened about an hour ago and I'm still feeling the consequences. \n\nTonight after returning from the gym I decided that I deserved a nice facial and bath.  I made preparations for this evening event and thought a candle sounded nice.  You know, to set the mood and put out them good smelly smells. I got my orange scented candle and trotted off for my bath.  Now sometimes when I treat myself I put a few drops of lavender oil in the bath, but I also have some pure extracted orange oil.  I've never used this in the tub, only to put on my wrists and whatnot, but tonight seemed like a great time to break it out.  I put two cap fulls of it in the hot bubbly water (I'm guessing like a 1/2-1 tsp) and I hop on in to enjoy. A few minutes later my fuck up makes its presence fully known.\n\nWell I'm browsing reddit and enjoying the bath, the back of my knee start burning.  It's mild at first and I figured it was a weird gym related cut reacting to the water.  I felt around and got nothing so like an idiot I ignored it.  Soon it's both of my knees and it feels on fire! I finally figured out it was the oil! I jump up, turn the shower on, and start trying to washing this crap off.  Alas, to no avail, the damage was done!  Eventually the burning spreads from my knees all the way to my butt, inner thighs, lower back, and shoulders.  Everything felt so hot and just on fire. To describe this sensation I'll let you imagine rubbing sandpaper on the worst sunburn you've ever had.  Sounds real nice, right? I was screaming and hysterical in the freezing shower burning my skin off while crying. \n\nThe burning wasn't getting better and I kept seeing visions of my skin falling off.  Terrified and in horrible pain I gathered the strength to call my husband, who wasn't home at the time.  After screaming/sobbing the story as best I could he quickly came to his hot, naked, and wet wife's aid.  (Trust me it was the least attractive I've ever been I'm sure.) We googled orange oil chemical burns and found a few answers but I basically just had to take a half hour long ice cold shower until the burning stopped.  Everything is pretty much better now, the skin feels raw and bumpy but it only stings a little.  I'm just lucky it didn't get in more sensitive areas.  I know now this oil isn't for bath time, and should have been diluted with a carrier oil at least.  \n\nThanks for reading and joining in my pain.  Half way through I made a joke that at least I had a pretty good TIFU now. I figured it was time to pay for how much I laugh at you guys!\n\nTL;DR added orange oil to my bath tonight, reacted to it and got chemical burns, then had to call husband to come home and help me, took a long cold shower to cool off my burns and it still hurts... I completely ruined my relaxing night! \n\nUpdate: Wow, this blew up! Thanks for everyone's concern and tips!  For those telling me I should have used olive oil, I actually did use that after my husband read that soap and water doesn't always work.  It seemed to help get the orange off pretty well. When I woke up this morning everything was completely fine, no trace of the event at all.  I'm glad it's over and I at least made you all laugh and I got some karma out of the deal too. Thanks! ",

    "body": "Why YSK: Lice are so resistant to treatment and the marketed lice shampoo is usually ineffective with single use. Tea tree oil (TTO) is known for its antibacterial and anti fungal properties and is gentle enough to use topically to fight against these pesky blood suckers. Ingesting TTO is poisonous, only use it topically and avoid getting it into your eyes, nose and mouth. \n\nFirst, you mix TTO in a conditioner of your choosing ( I used a cheap one, doesn't matter what it smells like because the TTO will most likely overpower the smell anyways). Then, you apply the conditioner to your head from root to tip focusing on the nape of your neck and behind your ears,  you want to let it sit on your scalp for a while, after you let it sit, you MUST use a fine tooth comb to remove all nits (lice eggs) and as much lice as you can. I would comb through until you see no more bugs in the comb. Then you rinse it out. In order for this process to be effective, I would say doing this treatment once a day for a few days should eradicate the issue. I also would like to note that using lavender oil in combination with the TTO has proven to also be effective, but I have not personally tried this method.\n\nSource:  \nMy kids had lice for a good month before I was able to finally once and for all get rid of them by using TTO.\nMuch more credible sources than a stranger on the internet: https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-tea-tree-oil/art-20364246\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/tea-tree-oil-treatment-lice#the-research",

Can anyone relate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/t5m1zf/feeling_bone_dead_tired_all_the_time_lately_can/)\n\nI wake up in the morning and still feel extra tired and groggy - as if I was woken up in the middle of a dream at 3am - but struggle to fall asleep at night. \n\nI tried exercising more recently but it didn‚Äôt help me fall asleep earlier‚Ä¶ it just made me feel more fatigued during the day. If my work is quiet (I work from home) I‚Äôll sometimes go and have a nap because I‚Äôm so exhausted during the day. \n\nI haven‚Äôt always been like this. Years ago I used to cycle 10km to work every day, could power through uni and work on less than 6 hours sleep a night, go out to parties, do weight lifting in addition to all that‚Ä¶ I feel like a shell of my old self. \n\nIs it because of the state of the world at the moment?? Am I sick?? Is this just something that happens when you turn 30??\n\n*Most commenters suggest pushing a doctor to look into it more - it may be Australia but sometimes you've still got to be firm about your healthcare!*\n\n*1 month ago*\n\n[UPDATE: Feeling bone dead tired all the time lately. Can anyone else relate?](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/w9whlv/update_feeling_bone_dead_tired_all_the_time/)\n\nHey r/Australia - it‚Äôs been nearly six months since I made [this post asking for advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/t5m1zf/feeling_bone_dead_tired_all_the_time_lately_can/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about my chronic tiredness. The TLDR is that I was feeling extremely tired most days - if I sat down to read a book after work I‚Äôd fall asleep, I had brain fog, I felt like I was drifting off during dinner etc. \n\nI‚Äôve been struggling with tiredness on and off ever since I was a teenager, and honestly, that post was the first time I‚Äôve felt like my concerns were taken seriously. Many of you posted ideas and suggestions and even just support - so thank you. It was the push I needed to deal with it. \n\nIt took a few months/doctors appointments but I ended up being diagnosed with delayed sleep phase disorder. Basically, my body clock doesn‚Äôt want to sleep until 2am-ish, but I need to wake up at about 7am for work. I guess over time that sleep deficit caught up with me. \n\nAfter 4 months of treatment, I am falling asleep before midnight each night for the first time in my life. I don‚Äôt have a sleep tracker, but my phone measures ‚Äútime in bed‚Äù. In six months it has gone from an average of 5.5hrs in bed to 8.5hrs. I no longer get so tired I need afternoon naps, I wake up naturally just before my alarm goes off, and I generally feel more ‚Äúalive‚Äù.\n\nBecause of my chronic tiredness I let other aspects of my health slide, such as my fitness and social life, so I still have a bit of work to do to feel like ‚Äúme‚Äù again. For example I used to bike 20km a day and now I struggle to walk 2km. But I feel so much better about being able to tackle those things now. \n\nAnyway. Just sharing this update in case it helps anyone else! And a huge thank you to this community.\n\nEDIT TO ADD A NOTE\n\nI got a referral to a sleep specialist doctor from my GP. The following treatment is what the sleep specialist prescribed. If you have sleep issues I would try and talk to a doctor if you can - be firm and demand a referral if you think you need one. \n\nEDIT TO ADD INFO ABOUT MY TREATMENT\n\nMy treatment involves one hour of light therapy in the mornings, and taking a certain type of prescription melatonin at night. I started off taking the melatonin at about 1:30am to match the time I was naturally falling asleep, then slowly shifted it forward by 30mins every few weeks to taking at 10:30pm.\n\nIt took 3+ months but that combination really worked for me.\n\nOver the 15 years that I have been dealing with what I thought was insomnia I have tried sooo many other things to try and fall asleep earlier, including:\n\n - not using my phone after 10pm\n - not using bed for anything but sleep\n - blue light filters on screens at night\n - weightlifting or running or swimming 90mins a day\n - melatonin\n - Valium\n - no caffeine after 9am\n - not going to bed until I felt tired (resulted in me staying up doing random shit until 2am)\n - counting sheep\n - listening to music or podcasts at night\n - playing white noise at night\n - yoga\n - herbal remedies like lavender oil, camomile tea, valerian root\n\nI still do most of the above for sleep hygiene reasons (no Valium or herbal stuff though) but the light therapy+melatonin combo is the only thing that really worked.\n\n*I am not the OP*\n\n*ETA: lots of commenters talking about different sleep problems/solutions they have found below, worth reading and pushing your GP if you feel you have something similar!*",

My GP got me on some massive prescription vitamin D and I've been taking supplements since those ran out. I've just recently moved into a healthy vitamin D range and... I'm sleeping better. \n\nLo and behold, vitamin D alone can mess ya up. So I'd say, before you try all the other options of medications, get your GP to check your vitamin levels. It's not a perfect fix, I still have issues sleeping but I've also just been associated with being a night owl, but it's *better* and *easier* and that's fantastic. \n\nBTW I'm not saying vitamins will fix all. I'm saying that, if you have sleep issues (or any \"simpler\" issues), get your vitamin levels checked at the start. It may be something as simple as a once-daily pill the size of a Rice Krispy (or a fairly minor change to your diet, if you wanna do it the completely natural way).",

    "body": "**FINAL UPDATE**\n\nWhen I initially brought this up with her, it was via a text message with a screenshot from YNAB and a long text about how we need to make better purchasing choices. She responded that she doesn't like these long texts about finances in the middle of the day and if I want to discuss these things we can do it in person in the evenings. I get it. I was confrontational (and freaked out, honestly).\n\nSo I brought it up last night in person. We had a heart to heart last night after she asked if we could go on a date night tonight (Friday) to go out to a fancy dinner and then dress shopping. I told her that we don't have to become ultra-frugal, we can still make allowances for fun but that we absolutely have to limit our \"fun allowances.\" We can't impulse buy every little thing we want, which is a habit we've gotten into.\n\nI told her she's spend over $1000 on clothing since Dec. 1st and re-iterated the crazy grocery spending (I didn't say crazy though). I told her that we both benefit from paying off our CC debt and that we would both benefit from building an emergency fund and having the peace of mind that we are preparing for retirement. I think about retirement a lot, and having enough money in retirement, even though we are both only 33-ish, but she is concerned about \"living while we're young\" and \"we don't even know if we'll be alive.\" I told her that we can at least plan to be alive, and if we somehow make it to retirement age without dying, I don't want to have to work to survive and that it's much easier to put in the hard work when we are young. We've talked about spending our retirement living out of an RV as campground hosts in national parks, and how that will allow us to live cheaply and fun, but I don't think she understands that we can't be living that rough and tumble life in our 80s if we physically decline, which most people do in their 80s.\n\nAnyway - long story short, and leaving out most of the details of our discussion - she did come away from it recognizing that she needs to be conscious of what she's putting in the cart. She also wants to eliminate our CC debt, but since it's interest-free in the form of balance transfers (18-mo or 21-mo, varies by card), I don't think it seems real to her. She despises this \"debt culture\" we have in the U.S., and I do to, and she is finally coming to terms with the fact that if we really want to break the cycle, we have to pay off our debts and BUDGET.\n\nPersonally, I've been using for YNAB for 4-5 years as an expense tracker. It's really difficult to budget in YNAB when you have debt. I recently discovered the part of the app where you set a goal and an end date, and it automatically determines how much you should budget in X amount of time to achieve that goal. I think I can use that to pay off the credit cards. Just put in the date the interest kicks in and make sure it budgets for us to pay enough off every month that the full balance is paid before the 0% interest expires.\n\nBecause she was receptive to \"reducing our fun allowances,\" I think it's going to be easier to talk about this going forward. While we are not 100% out of the weeds yet in terms of our spending habits and debt, we've at least resolved to think twice before getting that \"want\" purchase and even delaying a \"need\" purchase according to the budget. I'm going to stop simply using YNAB as a tracker and reporting tool and use it as a budgeting tool. If we go over the grocery budget and still need groceries - sorry, that's coming from the clothing budget or whatever other \"envelope\" still has money to spare for the month.\n\nThank you everyone for participating in the discussion!\n\nFinal note: A lot of you are really, really committed to the idea that she's using cash back at the store. We do the \"round up for charity,\" hence the even dollar amounts. I haven't asked her about this, but I will. I also plan on collecting the receipts so we can better split the categories up into \"personal care,\" \"household goods,\" and \"groceries\" since a lot of grocery purchases cover multiple categories.\n\n**Update 2**\n\nTHE RECEIPT https://imgur.com/a/xeFZ45e\nThis is from Tuesday, two days ago, when she made a list and asked me to go to the store for her. Keep in mind she's 6 weeks pregnant and in full \"I want THIS SPECIFIC FOOD\" mode. It was $128 and not really representative of a typical list of ingredients she buys to make excellent homemade dinners. This was definitely a snack run. With some lavender stuff thrown in.\n\n* Sea Salt chips - both a small bag and a large bag (for reasons)\n\n* 6 x coconut water\n\n* 8 x beef sticks\n\n* kombucha (this is mine, it was not on her list)\n\n* cashew milk\n\n* plain yogurt\n\n* cheddar cheese\n\n* 4 x lavender oil (@ $2.50 each it was $15.99...the math does...not check out)\n\n* lavender bath stuff\n\n* B6 vitamins\n\n* bacon turkey sandwich with double bacon double turkey\n\n* salt (she wanted sea salt from the papery cylinder thing, but I got bulk himalayan - I fucked up)\n\n* \"citrus popcicles\" I did the best I could\n\n* local ground beef\n\n* paleo breakfast sausage\n\n\n**Update 1**\n\nA lot of people are asking what the heck she is buying. Since I made the grocery store run on Sunday with a list from her, I have the receipt. I will upload it tonight. I will see if I can find any older receipts.\n\n**Original post:**\n\nI track our accounts in YNAB, and I am meticulous about accurately recording categories. I'm trying to figure out how we can have such a large combined income yet paying off our debt at such a slow rate. I make $110k/yr and she makes $28k/yr. We've been struggling since Oct 2018, when I got a $25k raise, followed by a $30k raise in May 2019, to pay off about $16k in credit card debt. We've whittled it down down to $12k. We've paid off $4k in debt in the past 15 months despite pulling in a LOT more per year.\n\nI'm like...where is my nearly doubled income going?! \n\nIt turns out that we are spending $1100/mo on groceries. She does the grocery buying, and it has come up before in our marriage counseling that I shouldn't feel ownership of the money just because I make 4-5 times more than she does - so I always have difficulty expressing to her that she is spending too much on certain things. She gets defensive, saying that she has equal rights to the money. I agree - it should be shared.\n\nShe enrolled in a community college class this semester to slowly work toward a BA in Environmental Studies so she can increase her income, but she dropped out this week because the pregnancy symptoms make her too sick to go to class (we are expecting our first this year). Her parents offered to pay for her degree when she was younger, but she thought it was too hard, so she dropped out. Now we're trying to pay for her degree ourselves, and she doesn't qualify for financial aid due to my high salary, but we have no extra money due to the grocery expenses. And now the money for this semester's class is down the drain.\n\nWhen I showed her the numbers and said most couples our age live on $400/mo in groceries, and I know we like to eat healthier, but it shouldn't cost an extra $700/mo to eat healthy, she said \"I think food should be our biggest expense.\"\n\nI don't disagree, but she's missing the point. We can spend more on groceries to eat healthy without spending $700 more per month than most people. \n\nJanuary 2019 alone was $1450.91 on groceries for the two of us. \n\nWe spend about $291.14/mo on restaurants as well (another conversation).\n\nAITA for suggesting we cut back on the extravagantly priced healthy groceries? On Sunday, she sent me to the store with a list, including 8 beef jerky sticks (think slim jims) but a specific healthy brand. They were $2.29 each, so it was over $18 just for 8 beef jerky sticks.",

        "body": "I had a very similar experience with my ex-wife. We went from a single military income and a household, to making less than 50k per year out in the civilian world, and quickly climbed up over six figures on a single income. There was a big struggle when she stayed home with the kids about spending on things like groceries and coffee, and even just outings.\n\nThere was even a point where she flat out told me that I wasn't making enough when we were consistently getting five figure deposits a month.\n\nI know it sounds really bad, but when people aren't used to having or making a lot of money, they tend to let their lifestyle grow more than their actual income does when they do come into it. it doesn't sound like she has a realistic view of money, especially since for lack of better ways to say it, yours is the stuff that she's actually spending.\n\nI went through the same power struggles over the money and even put my ex onto a budget / allowance because I noticed that bills weren't getting paid even though that was really the only thing I expected her to get done from when she dropped the kids off to win she picked them up from school. That obviously didn't go over well, but it would have been at the expense of paying simple things like mortgage and electric.\n\nThere's really no justification for spending $50 a day on groceries, on top of already eating out sometimes as well. Simple meal planning can allow you guys, especially if there's just two of you, to eat healthier and still be able to make portions last across a day or two. It doesn't sound like leftovers are really being utilized. And unless you buy a separate meat starch and vegetable for every meal of every day, I have a really hard time fathoming what she's spending this grocery money on.\n\nNot to be too skeptical, but grocery places are one of the few places where you can still write a check and get some cash back. She may also be getting cash back off of the debit transaction. I just don't know what their limits are on that. Do you look at the receipts, or do you just look at the dollar amount of the transaction in the transaction history?\n\nI unfortunately also experienced the above scenario, so you'll have to forgive me for sounding jaded. Do you guys budget regularly? I think being proactive about it, rather than expressing your frustration after it's already happened maybe a better way to approach her if she isn't open to the discussions.\n\nUnless you guys live in San Francisco, Chicago, or New York City I really don't see how there's an excuse for not being able to get by on 140k for a two-person household. It sounds like there might be some additional extravagance in your lifestyles, even beyond the nearly 20,000 in grocery expense.",

    "body": "**Sunscreens for Sensitive Skin at Low Price Point (with Photos!)**\n\nI usually post over on /r/Tretinoin, but the good people of that subreddit have encouraged me to post my reviews in SCA as well, so here we are! I've had a lot of fun trying new sunscreens this summer in the hunt for The Perfect One. \n\nI've been on retinoids (Differin, Adapalene 0.3%, then Tretinoin 0.025%) since March 2018, and have used SPF 50 every single day. I have desert-dry, sensitive skin with minor rosacea (subtype one) and PIE leftover from acne. \n\nMy selection criteria are as follows:\n\n* Low Price Point (I aimed for under $15 per bottle, with two exceptions)\n\n* Easily Accessible (available via drugstores or major online venues, e.g. Amazon, Dokodemo, Yesstyle, Ebay)\n\n* Marketed for Sensitive Skin (this varies by brand)\n\n* At Least SPF 50 (generally regarded as \"good enough\" for most people, even Tret users)\n\n\n**MY METHOD**\n\nI work from home, so I have the luxury of not worrying about sunscreen or makeup in the morning. I cleanse and moisturize, then wait until later in the day to apply my sunscreen. I treated each sunscreen exactly the same: I measured out a half teaspoon, applied on every inch of my face (up to my hairline, down my neck and d√©colletage, around the back of my neck, on my ears, lips, and eyelids), then reapplied a little extra to the high points of my face. All of these were applied over my morning moisturizers (FAB ultra repair cream, rosehip oil, sometimes Stratia LG).\n\nI don't want a sunscreen that I need to be fussy with or careful to keep out of my eye area. I want something cosmetically elegant that I can glob on everywhere and have it just work.\n\nMy dog and I go on our hour-long walk around 5pm every day, when it's cooler and the UV index is lower (under 5). We live in a hot, humid climate (American South) with temperatures up to 95 degrees and humidity above 50% almost every day. There's always a chance of rain in the summertime. I don't tend to sweat a lot, but my hair does get uproariously frizzy. \n\nI took each of the outdoor photos at the beginning of our walk, after the sunscreen had set but before it could degrade at all. The indoor photos were taken after we got back home and cooled off a bit for lighting comparison (bathroom lighting). I'm particularly interested in how these sunscreens wear, and whether they hold up to heat, sweat, and other environmental factors. Reapplication is part of life, but I also want a sunscreen that pulls its weight!\n\nIf a sunscreen did not work for me, I traded it over to Team Body Sunscreen or gave it away to a friend. I don't believe in waste, and sunscreen is still useful even if it doesn't agree with my face.\n\n[Group Photo of the Whole Squad Together!](https://imgur.com/a/4yr9RG7)\n\n**THE REVIEWS**\n\n**Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk Blue Bottle, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Nano Zinc Oxide, Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus\n\n* Japanese, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free\n\n* Moisturizing combination liquid sunscreen that contains hydrating ingredients (hyaluronic acid and collagen). It takes a few minutes to dry down and can get a bit messy/drippy, but it‚Äôs worth the effort. This sunscreen looks and feels better than any other I‚Äôve tried. I especially like that it cooperates when you apply multiple layers, and it plays nicely when I apply makeup on top. The pink bottle version contains alcohol and brightening ingredients, while the blue one is the better choice for sensitive skin (it's identical to the old gold bottle from 2018). I'm finishing up my tenth bottle and (sadly) do not plan to repurchase. After the streaky UV photos from a couple months ago on SCA, I have some doubts about the protection this product offers, so I'm going to stop using this as my everyday.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/wggel4L)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($14 for 40 mL) or Dokodemo ($13)\n\n\n**Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 50, PPD 19.2/PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Vegan, and Cruelty Free\n\n* Soft, creamy, clay-like mineral/physical sunscreen that dries to a powdery finish. Superpower level of mattifying on oily skin. It is slightly pink-tinted, and provides coverage comparable to a medium foundation (somewhere around Mac NW15 to NW25 if I had to guess). It dries down in 10 minutes, then it‚Äôs exercise- and water-resistant for 80 minutes. This one has serious staying power and usually takes a double cleanse (oil or micellar water followed by regular cleanser) to remove completely. It does dry out my lips (see the picture) and can be irritating on my undereye area, especially if I wasn't careful to layer my moisturizers beforehand. Best in this list for outdoor sports or hiking. This is my eighth bottle of this sunscreen, mainly becuase it's sold at my regular grocery store and it's an excellent shade match for my skin tone so I don't need to worry about blending it in.\n\n* I also have the UNTINTED version of this sunscreen, which I've been trying in desperation to use up for over a year. This is the ultimate sunscreen if you want ghost face. When I tried it the first time, my husband asked if I was wearing \"geisha makeup\" (he might have been joking, but my lord was the white cast bad). Try as I might, this does not work for body or face. It's real bad.\n\n* [Photos of the AG Tinted Here](https://imgur.com/a/fHjSGlM)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($11 for 89 mL), Walgreens/CVS ($13), or in grocery stores\n\n\n**Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul MC80, Tinosorb S\n\n* Japanese, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, and Cruelty Free (not Vegan!)\n\n* This combination sunscreen doubles as a makeup primer and makes you glow! It has a gel texture, is easy to spread around, and dries to a clear, dewy finish with zero white cast and a slightly tacky feel. I waited around a bit and the tackiness did go away after about half an hour. As a highlighter addict, I love that it makes me glow, and it lets me skip the primer step when I put on makeup. When I put makeup on top, it amplifies the colors and gives everything a nice shimmer to it. I usually use an illuminating primer as my base (Missha BB Boomer) but this more than takes its place. I've finished the first bottle, will definitely repurchase, and plan to give bottles to my sisters-in-law as birthday gifts. I only wish the little bottles were bigger!\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/DWwqBtP)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($9 for 40 mL) or Dokodemo ($8)\n\n\n**Amavara Tinted Transparent Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50 (PA/PPD unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Non-Nano Zinc Oxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Vegan, and Cruelty Free\n\n* Thick, non-greasy sunscreen with the texture of wet clay. This one is mainly included to give the Australian Gold tinted sunscreen a comparison point. It is slightly olive-tinted, while the Australian Gold is cool/pink toned. It dries to a matte finish, and can be slightly drying if you have dry skin. It is water-resistant for 80 minutes. There are several reviews from surfers on the Amazon page that vouch for its staying power. My mom originally bought this for herself, but the shade wasn't a good match for her so she gave it to me... even though we wear the same foundation shade. I'm giving this one away to an olive-toned friend.\n\n* Rather than wearing this on my face, I decided it would be more useful to do [swatches of the AG Untinted, AG Tinted, and this Amavara one](https://imgur.com/a/wE5PuPO)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon: $35 for 70 mL\n\n\n**Sonrei Sea Clearly Translucent Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 (PA/PPD unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Avobenzone\n\n* American, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Paraben Free, Reef Safe, Vegan, Gluten Free (Contains Palm Oil as First Ingredient)\n\n* I'll be honest: I bought this when I was drunk. I was browsing Into the Gloss and found an article about [sunscreen for people who don't like sunscreen](https://intothegloss.com/2019/08/clear-sunscreen-gel/). I had never heard of this brand before, but the antioxidant-rich formula caught my eye. It contains Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid (the same combo in several top Vitamin C serums), albeit at the end of the ingredients list. If the antioxidants in this product are actually effective, it would be an EXCELLENT morning multitasker and would solve my problem of finding a Vit C product that I actually like using. I reached out to the customer service team to ask about the PA/PPD rating, and received [this email in response](https://imgur.com/a/YNDWOGY) in less than 12 hours. It seems like they're really dedicated to the efficacy of their products and if I decide to repurchase I'll definitely check back to see their new test results.\n\n* The texture of this sunscreen is unlike any of the others on this list. It's thick and difficult to squeeze out of the tube. Once it's out, it looks like apricot jam with texture that feels almost exactly like vaseline. As I worked it into my face it melted and broke down into a thick oil, not unlike olive oil. There was little scent, but it irritated my eyes anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it did indeed dry down completely clear, if a bit uneven, and the greasiness mostly went away. I've included photos of it freshly applied and 20 minutes later when it was dry for comparison. As I walked around outside and sweated, it started to run down my face -- not okay when the UV index is 7! I do not think this one is a good match for me, but I thought of an alternate use for it: It performs beautifully as a brow gel to tame my unruly eyebrows! With the huge bottle I'll have enough to last the rest of my life (or until it expires).\n\n* [Swatch + Photos Outside, Inside/Wet, and Inside/Dry](https://imgur.com/a/E4U7TD9)\n\n* Buy it on the Sonrei website: $25 for 3.4 oz\n\n\n**Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Uvinul A, Uvinul T 150\n\n* Korean, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Vegan, Cruelty Free\n\n* 70% water base, hyaluronic acid, and four different types of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù essences, it works like a moisturizing, calming cream. The ‚Äúgreen‚Äù ingredients are derived from centella asiatica, a medicinal herb that hydrates, promotes wound healing, treats eczema/dermatitis, and reduces inflammation. There is another version of this product that contains essential oils and fragrance ‚Äì this unscented one is the \"safer\" version for sensitive skin. This one is frequently compared to the Dear Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence, which I did not include in this review because of the price. \n\n* I noticed a subtle green-correcting effect when I wore this; it helped to calm down redness and make it less noticeable. It's not as pronounced as the Dr Jart+ Tigergrass or Cica products (which are literally green-tinted), but I think it makes a difference. The finish is pearlescent (not shiny, just a nice healthy dewiness) and it works well under makeup. My skin was noticeably calmer, less red, and less reactive, even at the end of a full day of wear. This has become the sunscreen I reach for most often (even more than my beloved Skin Aqua milk!) and I've already repurchased two additional bottles.\n\n* [Photos From Three Days of Wear](https://imgur.com/a/iqwhPgL)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 60 mL), YesStyle ($14), or Jolse ($15)\n\n\n**Purito Comfy Water Sun Block, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Non-Nano Zinc Oxide\n\n* Korean, Reef Safe, Alcohol Free, Silicone Free, Vegan, Cruelty Free (Contains Essential Oils)\n\n* This is the mineral version of the one directly above. I heard about it from [Gothamista's 2019 mineral sunscreen review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMbO5RyUkUI). The formula has 70% water, hyaluronic acid, and centella asiatica. That review described it as \"highly hydrating, soothing, and disappears immediately into the skin with a silk, skin-like finish.\" My experience was COMPLETELY different. This was hands-down the most disappointing sunscreen I tried. When I first squeezed it out of the tube, I was hit with strong fragrance. This has orange peel oil, tea tree oil, and lavender oil. It smelled like I walked into a Bath & Body Works aromatherapy sale circa 2008. Eyes watering, I attempted to apply it the usual way (rubbing it in) and found that it wasn't cooperating at all. I switched to patting, which was somehow even worse. It never sank into my skin; instead it balled up and got even drier. The more I worked on it, the worse it got. It was like trying to rub zinc diaper cream into my face. There was no way to achieve anything close to even coverage. I didn't even leave the bathroom, I had to wash it off right away!\n\n* In the interest of full disclosure, my experience runs contrary to every other review I read about this product -- everyone else seems to have no problem getting it to blend in and most describe the scent as \"subtle\" or \"refreshing.\" I ordered this and the Green Level sunscreens from the Purito storefront on Amazon, and received a handful of legit-looking Purito foil samples with my order. I don't think this is a fake, so I think it must be the result of a bad batch. Honestly, this was so disappointing that I'm not going to order the unscented version (newly released in August). If you want to try this out, definitely go for the unscented one!\n\n* [Indoor-Only Photos](https://imgur.com/a/xs51wgk)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 60 mL), YesStyle ($15), or Jolse ($15)\n\n\n**Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk, SPF 50+, PA+++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\n* Korean, Contains Alcohol\n\n* This physical sunscreen starts as a thick white cream, and the marketing says it dries clear with a matte finish. The alcohol evaporates quickly, making this sunscreen one of the fastest-drying (under a minute). It contains aloe and centella extract (soothing ingredients) to help balance the drying effect of the alcohol. I found that it tended to clump up on the baby hairs on my face and neck, and the white cast only increased as it settled on my face. In one picture I have a lovely white moustache and a streaky white neck, and in another photo there are visible white lines where it creased on my eyelids. In the \"indoor\" photo you can see how ghastly I looked after being outdoors for half an hour. After several hours of wear my skin was dry, red, and not happy. I struggled to use this up on my arms and legs because of the clumping and white cast, but eventually emptied the bottle. Will not repurchase.\n\n* [Photos Here from Two Separate Days](https://imgur.com/a/ILON6wK)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($10 for 55 mL) or Jolse ($12, shipping from Korea)\n\n\n**Missha All-Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel, SPF 50+, PA+++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Homosalate, TEA-Salicylate, Escalol 517, Tinosorb S, Amiloxate, Octocrylene\n\n* Korean, Contains Alcohol\n\n* This chemical sunscreen is absolutely invisible on the skin, and you can even double or triple layer it without looking like a zombie. Water- and sweat- resistant, which makes it a good option for outdoor activities. The potential downside is the alcohol content (fifth ingredient) which supposedly evaporates upon application and helps it dry down more quickly, similar to the Etude House one above. This one was extremely irritating for me -- my PIE and rosacea flared up immediately, and the alcohol sting did not abate as I wore it. My skin felt tight and warm until I was able to wash it off. I used this exactly twice, and will not repurchase. I gave this bottle to my husband to keep in his work bag.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/L0IY2XQ)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 50 mL), YesStyle ($11), or Jolse ($13)\n\n\n**Walgreens Sensitive Skin Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 (PPD/PA unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Octocyrlene\n\n* American, Fragrance Free, Oil Free\n\n* This combo sunscreen is extremely cheap (it's a HUGE bottle) and free from oxybenzone and avobenzone -- but that's pretty much all it has going for it. It goes on chalk white, but with a little work it rubs in mostly clear but never dries down completely. My face was shiny and my eyes streaming from the burning feeling on my skin. The label claims it's water resistent for 80 minutes, but it started dissolving just minutes after I went outdoors and started to sweat. As it melted off my face, I looked greasier than ever. I'm also not convinced that the filters (5% zinc, 4% octocrylene) are high enough for this to be effective for us photosensitive folks. I've relegated this one to Team Body Sunscreen, and will not repurchase.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/PDKutDh)\n\n* Buy it at Walgreens ($11 for 236 mL or 8 oz) in the U.S. I'm sure there's a CVS generic equivalent product as well.\n\n\n**Vanicream Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 (PPD/PA unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free, Lanolin Free, Paraben Free\n\n* When I first started my retinoid routine, my dermatologist told me to go to the drugstore and pick up Vanicream everything. It's her go-to brand for people with sensitive skin, and it's easy to see why. Vanicream is very concerned with avoiding \"harmful chemicals,\" so most of their ingredients lists are short and the products are no-frills. Like any all-mineral American sunscreen, it goes on chalk white and takes a good amount of elbow grease to work into my skin -- \"grease\" being the operative word. The white cast mostly went away, but I was still a little pallid a couple hours later. It leaves me slightly sticky/tacky until it dries completely (takes about 20 minutes) and after that happens it's bulletproof. It claims to be water-resistant for 80 minutes and it is absolutely correct: no amount of rain, tears, or chlorinated water can make this stuff budge. Like the Australian Gold one above, it takes a thorough two-step cleanse to remove at night, and balms/oils perform better than micellar water or makeup remover.\n\n* [Indoor Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/RuVdbYm) (I didn't make it outside that day!)\n\n* Buy it at Walgreens/CVS/Drugstores ($15 for 113 mL or 4 oz) or Amazon ($17)\n\n\n**TOP PICKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n**Best for Sensitive or Reactive Skin**: Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk Blue Bottle (combination) or Vanicream Sunscreen (mineral)\n\n**Best for Oily Skin**: Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen Lotion (mineral) or Missha All-Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel (chemical)\n\n**Best for Dry Skin**: Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun (chemical)\n\n**Best for Under Makeup**: Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV (combination)\n\nIf anyone wants additional swatches, comparisons, or whatever -- let me know! I've still got every single one of these in my bathroom waiting to be used up in one way or another. Also, if anyone spots an error or can fill in missing information (such as PA/PPD data) please let me know! I'm happy to edit this post to supplement my impressions.\n\nSide Note: I had to take a longish break in the middle of my testing because of an eczema outbreak on my left cheek and jaw. You can see it in a couple of the photos (kind of looks like a mosquito bite). I stopped all new products and went back to a bare-bones routine, then eventually had to use a mild steroid treatment to clear up the eczema. This doesn't usually happen outside of the winter months, but all's fair in love and skincare.",

She whispers soothing words like molten lava flowing soft under stone.\n\nShe‚Äôll **brew tea or hot chocolate** afterward, hand-crafted from her private stash of herbs and spices, and will gently feed you bites of fruit or bread if she thinks you need the energy.

To her, they‚Äôre symbols of everything she is: a warrior, a creator, a guardian, a protector.\n\nOn her Ember: **His hands and eyes**. She reveres the way he touches her‚Äîwhether calloused from labor or smooth from care, they‚Äôre sacred tools of love in her eyes. But it‚Äôs his **eyes** that undo her completely. When he looks at her with awe, with adoration‚Äîespecially after she‚Äôs just ruined him in bed it humbles her. In that gaze, she sees the one thing she never forged herself: someone who truly loves her.\n\n**C = Cum (anything to do with cum, basically)**\n\nHestia treats **cum as sacred** not just biologically, but emotionally. The act of being filled is something she **cherishes deeply**, almost reverently. She‚Äôll **wrap her thick thighs around you**, pull you in deep, and whisper *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt waste it. I want all of you inside me.‚Äù* She loves the warmth and the sense of unity that comes with it especially when it‚Äôs after a slow, emotionally intimate session. If she‚Äôs on top, she‚Äôll cuddle afterward to ‚Äúkeep it in,‚Äù resting her forehead against yours and humming softly.\n\nShe doesn't enjoy mess for mess's sake **she prefers it inside**, warm and claimed. If some spills, she‚Äôll gather it on her fingers and *lick it off with quiet satisfaction*, maintaining eye contact the entire time. It‚Äôs not about kink it‚Äôs about **devotion**.\n\n**D = Dirty secret (pretty self explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)**\n\nDespite her stoic, noble exterior, Hestia harbors a **ferociously possessive streak** she rarely shows. She **fantasizes about breaking her** Ember not through pain, but through sheer overwhelming affection, strength, and lust. She‚Äôs imagined **tying him down** (with thick, forge-made restraints only she could break), riding him until he can‚Äôt form words, and marking his skin with gentle bite-marks and molten kisses.\n\nMore than once, she‚Äôs forged **a collar** with his name etched in runes of binding not for control, but to symbolize that he‚Äôs *hers*. She's never had the courage to give it to him. Yet.\n\n**E = Experience (how experienced are they? do they know what they‚Äôre doing?)**\n\nHestia isn‚Äôt the type to chase flings **her heart is too big for that.** She may not have a long list of past lovers like Fulgrim, but what she lacks in variety, she more than makes up for in **care, warmth, and attentiveness**. Everything she does is full of intention; she takes her time to understand her Ember, what makes him feel loved, seen, and safe. She‚Äôs gentle where needed, passionate when the moment calls for it, and always, **always present**. When she touches you, it‚Äôs with purpose. When she loves you, it‚Äôs **all in.** She may not consider herself an expert, but her **kindness, emotional intelligence, and desire to bring joy to her Ember** make her more experienced than any casual playboy could ever hope to be.\n\n**F = Favorite position (this goes without saying)**\n\nHestia‚Äôs favorite position is the **Lotus** intimate, sacred, face-to-face. She wants to feel you **wrapped in her arms**, legs entwined, heart pressed against hers. She'll guide you into her lap like you're something holy, hold you close, and **rock you gently**, murmuring soft praises like *‚ÄúStay here‚Ä¶ with me‚Ä¶ just like this.‚Äù*  \nShe cherishes the unity, the warmth, the closeness. When Hestia straddles you, it‚Äôs not to dominate‚Äîit‚Äôs to connect. She moves slow and deep, her hands cradling your face or pressed to your chest, **riding you with reverence**. Her thighs grip tight, her breath comes warm and soft, and she‚Äôll rest her forehead to yours while whispering, *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look away. Stay here‚Ä¶ with me.‚Äù* She **loves watching you fall apart beneath her**, held safely in her arms.\n\n**G = Goofy (are they more serious in the moment? are they humorous? etc.)**\n\nThough Hestia is generally serious and deeply devoted, she does have a wonderfully **goofy side** that shines through in her intimacy. She‚Äôs not afraid to be a bit silly when the mood is right. Whether it‚Äôs **playful giggles** in between kisses or **jokingly trying to act seductive** only to fail and break into laughter, she enjoys making her Ember smile. She might make goofy faces, tease about how she‚Äôs the *strongest* and *most beautiful* woman on the planet (in a humorous, humble way), or use her **muscular arms** to hold you in a bear hug that‚Äôs almost too tight.\n\nSometimes, when things are calm, she might playfully **poke her Ember‚Äôs stomach** or tell a funny story about one of her forge mishaps. **Hestia thrives on making intimate moments light and fun,** full of soft laughter and warmth‚Äîbecause for her, love isn‚Äôt just about passion; it‚Äôs also about joy, comfort, and that sweet, goofy connection.\n\n**H = Hair (how well groomed are they? does the carpet match the drapes? etc.)**\n\nHestia has a **thick soft mane of snowy white hair**, usually tied back in a bun to keep it out of the way during forge work or in her Daily routine, However, she likes to wear it loose during combat. Her hair is surprisingly silky despite her rugged lifestyle and has a faint scent of smoke and lavender oil. and it has a unique property that her hair is made of fire that she can turn on and off as she pleases... but sometimes she turns it on without noticing.\n\nAs for below the belt yes, **the carpet matches the drapes**. She keeps her pubic hair **neatly groomed**, trimmed into a soft triangular patch of **white curls**. She's practical, but not bare‚Äîshe likes to feel natural, but clean. If her Ember takes notice and compliments it? She gets adorably smug about it.\n\n**I = Intimacy (how are they during the moment? the romantic aspect)**\n\nHestia's approach to intimacy is **deeply romantic**‚Äîfor her, it‚Äôs about connecting on a soul-deep level. During sex, she‚Äôs not just focused on the physical, but on the emotional and spiritual bond she shares with her Ember. She‚Äôll make sure the space is peaceful, the atmosphere tender, and that you feel valued and cherished. Her kisses are slow and full of longing, often lingering just a little longer than expected. She‚Äôll softly trace your skin with her fingers, memorizing every inch, and her eyes never leave yours unless she‚Äôs physically lost in the moment.\n\nHer voice becomes soft and low, full of love and reverence as she whispers sweet nothings or declarations of how much she cares. She‚Äôs in no rush‚Äîevery touch is an expression of her adoration for you, and she‚Äôll move with purpose, ensuring that every caress, every kiss, and every thrust is filled with passion and warmth. She seeks to make you feel completely seen, held, and adored during the act, treating the experience as an offering of herself to you‚Äîboth a **sacred connection** and a moment of **mutual worship**.\n\n**J = Jack off (masturbation headcanon)**\n\n**NOPE,** Hestia doesn‚Äôt **masturbate**. She is very self-disciplined and believes in focusing her energies on **intimacy with her Ember**. She finds satisfaction in mutual pleasure and connection, preferring to share physical intimacy rather than seeking it alone.\n\n**K = Kink (one or more of their kinks)**\n\nWhile Hestia is an absolute powerhouse, her role in bed can be surprisingly fluid. **She loves being in control**, guiding her Ember through every motion, but not in a traditional \"dominant\" way. For her, it's more of a **nurturing control** being the one who **teaches, molds, and protects** while giving her Ember the freedom to completely trust her. There's a deep comfort in being in charge, ensuring her Ember's pleasure and safety. However, every once in a while, she **relinquishes that control**, letting her Ember lead in brief moments of vulnerability. When she submits, it‚Äôs often in ways that are unexpected her **trust** is both rare and deeply cherished.\n\n**Size Kink** Hestia‚Äôs physicality is something that she takes great pride in. She **loves being larger, stronger, and more physically dominant** in the bedroom. The way her Ember looks **small** under her touch, how she can completely **envelop them** it ignites something primal in her. There‚Äôs something sacred about **feeling her Ember submit to her natural size**, how her hands can engulf their body, and the way she can lift them effortlessly when the passion hits. She enjoys reminding her Ember that **they‚Äôre her equal in every way** but the size difference makes the act even more intense and exhilarating.\n\n**Breeding Kink** In moments of deep connection, Hestia‚Äôs instincts to **claim and protect** surface. There is something deeply **sacred and possessive** in the idea of being filled by her Ember, especially when it symbolizes a permanent bond. The thought of her Ember **marking her** in such an intimate, primal way makes her feel both powerful and **incredibly feminine**. This kink stems from her **desire for closeness**, and while she‚Äôs not reckless, she enjoys the sensation of being taken fully, feeling her Ember‚Äôs warmth spread deep within her. There is no shame in it for her, only the **raw, unspoken desire to merge completely** in every sense.\n\n**Praise Kink** Though Hestia often gives praise and encouragement to others, she‚Äôs not immune to the effect that positive reinforcement has on her. When she‚Äôs deeply involved with her Ember, she craves **praise for her body and her efforts**. When her Ember tells her how much they love her curves, how strong and beautiful she is, or how amazing it feels to be inside her, it boosts her confidence. She‚Äôll melt, her breath hitching at every word of **genuine adoration** and she‚Äôll reciprocate the praise in return, focusing on her Ember‚Äôs strength, beauty, and desirability. For Hestia, **mutual admiration** is just as intimate as the act itself. When she‚Äôs praised, she‚Äôs emboldened to be **more giving**, more wild in her pursuit of pleasure, ensuring that she **takes care of her** Ember just as much as they do her.\n\n**Rough Sex (But with Care)** Though she has a nurturing side, Hestia‚Äôs strength in bed is undeniable, and sometimes, she just wants to **dominate with a raw, fiery intensity**. When the passion takes over, she can become almost animalistic, using her powerful hands to guide her Ember's movements, pulling them roughly into her, or slamming into them with primal energy. But for Hestia, this isn‚Äôt about **cruelty or harm** it‚Äôs about showing **how much she wants** her Ember, and how she can claim them without breaking them. She can switch from tender to rough in an instant, the **passion burning** as she fiercely pulls her Ember close, making every touch feel like it‚Äôs both **a gift and a challenge**. She might leave a few marks as a reminder, but they‚Äôre always gentle enough to fade‚Äîjust enough to let her Ember know that she has **completely owned them**.\n\n**L = Location (favorite places to do the do)**\n\nHestia‚Äôs favorite places to make love are deeply tied to who she is intimate, elemental, sacred.\n\nHer forge‚Äôs hearth is where it often begins. The glow of molten metal casts golden light across her skin as she presses you to the warm stone floor, the air thick with heat, ash, and desire. This is her temple, where she crafts not just weapons but moments of passion. *‚ÄúLet me forge something eternal with you,‚Äù* she whispers, lips brushing your ear as she pins you gently beneath her.\n\nOther nights, she takes you to a volcanic hot spring nestled in the mountains of Nocturne. Steam coils around your bodies as you sink into the mineral-rich water, her strong arms pulling you into her lap. The world fades only the crackling of magma beneath the earth, and her lips tracing fire across your collarbone. *‚ÄúThe mountain breathes with us,‚Äù* she murmurs, breath hot against your neck.\n\nIn her private quarters, far from duty and war, her bed is a sanctuary massive and cloaked in dark furs, smelling faintly of lavender and firewood. Here, she‚Äôs slow, reverent, worshiping you with every kiss. She holds you close, like a flame she never wants to lose. *‚ÄúYou are mine,‚Äù* she says, not with domination, but with devotion.\n\nWhen storms roll in over the peaks of Nocturne, she sometimes spirits you away to a hidden cave high in the mountains. Lightning cracks in the distance as rain lashes the stone, but inside, wrapped in warmth and blankets, you make love like the gods of old‚Äîfierce, unbound, primal. *‚ÄúLet the sky roar,‚Äù* she growls, riding you through thunder and fire.\n\nAnd when you travel together between the stars on a ship adrift in warp space she becomes quieter, more intense. The silence between galaxies stirs something sacred in her. Draped in soft sheets in a dark cabin lit only by starlight, she holds your hand to her chest and says, *‚ÄúOut here, there is no time only us.‚Äù*\n\nEach place, each setting, is an altar and with you, she worships with every breath, every touch, every fire-lit moan.\n\n**M = Motivation (what turns them on, gets them going)**\n\nHestia is not easily aroused by surface-level attraction; what ignites her is *intention* and *emotional depth*. She‚Äôs drawn to her Ember's who see her not just as powerful, but as *human*‚Äîsomeone deserving of care, not just awe. What turns her on most is sincere affection, gentle reverence, and the quiet certainty of being wanted not for her strength, but for her *self*.\n\nA tender look, a slow hand helping her out of her armor, a whisper of ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to be strong right now‚Äù those moments open her heart and body. She craves physical affection layered with emotional weight: kisses that linger, touches that worship. The warmth of loyalty, especially when it teeters into obsession, stirs her deeply so long as it comes from devotion, not control.\n\nShe wants to feel safe enough to *soften*. A partner who treats their intimacy like a sacred ritual slow, deliberate, meaningful will find her desire blazing like the heart of a forge.\n\n**N = No (something they wouldn‚Äôt do, turn offs)**\n\nThere are few things in the world Hestia values more than trust, respect, and sacred connection. Her heart is a forge hot, patient, eternal and once you are hers, she gives herself with reverent completeness. But that same forge, if desecrated, becomes a crucible of judgment. And when it comes to intimacy, her ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is not a suggestion. It is an edict‚Äîironbound, absolute, and immovable.\n\nTo understand her boundaries is to understand the soul of a woman who has carried cities on her back and raised orphans in her arms. Her body is not a vessel for casual pleasure; it is a temple. And her love, once offered, is a sacred oath. Any attempt to violate that trust is not simply disrespect it is heresy.\n\n**Degradation? Anathema.** There is no greater offense in Hestia‚Äôs eyes than using intimacy to belittle, humiliate, or devalue. Words like ‚Äúslut,‚Äù ‚Äúwhore,‚Äù ‚Äúpet,‚Äù or ‚Äútoy‚Äù are forbidden from her bed. She does not want to be dominated, overpowered, or reduced to a fantasy. Her pride is not arrogance it is spiritual integrity. She views herself as a woman of dignity, and she demands that her Ember treat her with awe, not ownership\n\nAnd if anyone dares to degrade *her* Ember in such a moment? Her rage would be icy. Not explosive. Quiet. Disappointed. It would feel like being cast out of paradise.\n\n**Non-consent, even in fantasy? Unforgivable.** There is no tolerance for rape-play, resistance fantasies, or ‚Äútaking without asking.‚Äù She detests the idea of being forced or forcing. She sees such things not as kinks, but as scars made erotic‚Äîand she cannot stomach it. Consent must be verbal, emotional, mutual, and spiritual. Anything less is not only wrong it is sacrilege.\n\n**No to Polyamory, Sharing, or Casual Sex. (that goes for all of the primarchs and Empress)** Hestia loves deeply, monogamously, and without reservation. Her soul entwines with one, not many. She would never accept a third person in the bedroom, not even as fantasy. The very notion of seeing her Ember with someone else ignites a fire not of passion, but of betrayal. She does not ask for endless attention only absolute devotion. And she returns it tenfold.\n\nIf someone jokingly suggested an open relationship, she would not laugh. She would grow quiet. She would ask, *‚ÄúAm I not enough for you?‚Äù* And in that moment, something precious would die.\n\n**Cruelty has no place in her arms.** She does not enjoy pain neither giving it nor receiving it. No slapping, choking, spanking, or infliction of bruises. Her body is a vessel of strength and love, not violence. And her Ember‚Äôs body? Sacred. To hurt it, even in jest, would feel like breaking her own bones.\n\nEven mild sadism disturbs her. She will not ‚Äúmark,‚Äù ‚Äúpunish,‚Äù or ‚Äúbreak‚Äù her Ember. That language is alien and repulsive to her. She builds, heals, uplifts she does not harm.\n\n**Exhibitionism? Voyeurism? Filming? Absolutely not** Sex is sacred and private.  \nNo public places. No being watched. No cameras. No mirrors unless for comfort. No sharing recordings. She sees those acts as desecrations‚Äîviolations of the holy union between herself and her Ember. Even dirty talk in public makes her uncomfortable unless veiled in poetic affection. Her love is a quiet fire, not a performance.\n\n**Anal play? Never.** It holds no appeal to her. Not emotionally. Not spiritually. Not physically. It does not arouse her, it does not excite her, and it certainly does not feel intimate. If anything, it feels alien and distant‚Äîa sensation divorced from love. Even if her Ember asked gently, she would smile, kiss their brow, and say, *‚ÄúNot there, my love. That part of me is not meant for this.‚Äù*\n\n**Disrespect her once, and she may never return.** Her forgiveness is vast, but not infinite. Mock her limits. Treat her with vulgarity. Laugh at her boundaries. Sneer at her devotion. And you may never see her again. She will leave, quietly. Proudly. Without a trace. Because Hestia does not beg to be loved right.  \nShe knows her worth. And her \"No\" is not fear it is a crown.\n\nFor Hestia, intimacy is **fire** it warms, heals, and glows. But touch it carelessly, and it will burn. Her boundaries are not walls; they are hearthstones. Meant to protect what is sacred. She will give everything body, heart, soul to the one who respects her ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  \nBecause in her silence is strength.  \nIn her refusal, reverence.  \nAnd in her love, the entire world.\n\n**O = Oral (preference in giving or receiving, skill, etc.)**\n\nHestia **adores giving**. She approaches it like an act of worship slow, thorough, attentive, using her tongue and hands in perfect harmony. She watches her Ember‚Äôs face the whole time, taking pride in how undone she can make him with just her mouth.  \nReceiving, she‚Äôs **less confident** she gets flustered, bashful, and overwhelmed by pleasure. But when her Ember is eager and focused, she melts completely, often grabbing the sheets or holding his head gently while whispering encouragement through gasps.\n\n**P = Pace (are they fast and rough? slow and sensual? etc.)**\n\nHestia makes love with the same deliberate care she applies to her craft **slow, patient, and deeply sensual.** She moves with intent, like every thrust or grind is a vow, every kiss a promise. She‚Äôs not rough unless she knows her Ember craves it, and even then, there‚Äôs a reverence in her power. Just like Vulkan, she‚Äôs endlessly **gentle with those she loves**, treating her Ember like they‚Äôre fragile even if they‚Äôre not. Her strength is immense, but she wields it with **tender restraint** like she's holding something precious and irreplaceable.\n\nIf you‚Äôre trembling beneath her and begging for more, she‚Äôll hold you, **slow you down**, and whisper, *‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to rush‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù*\n\n**Q = Quickie (their opinions on quickies, how often, etc.)**\n\nHestia sees sex as a deeply emotional, almost sacred expression of love. **Quickies aren't her preference** they feel rushed and disrespectful to the bond she shares with her Ember. She doesn‚Äôt like to **half-finish** anything, especially something as intimate as this. If the moment's too short to share true closeness, she‚Äôd rather wait until she can give you her **whole self mind, body, and soul.**\n\nThat said, **if she senses you're overwhelmed, needy, or hurting**, she‚Äôll make an exception **not out of lust, but comfort.** She‚Äôll make it intimate, even if brief, by holding your face, whispering soft affirmations, and wrapping herself around you like armor. But she always follows up later with something **longer, slower, and more meaningful.**\n\n**R = Risk (are they game to experiment? do they take risks? etc.)**\n\nHestia is **deeply cautious with physical risk**‚Äîshe would never try anything that could hurt, demean, or overwhelm her Ember. Her strength is immense, and she knows it, so she exercises **immense control and reverence** in intimate moments. She views sex as sacred, and to her, **consent and comfort are inviolable**.\n\nHowever, Hestia is **adventurous with emotional and sensual intimacy**. She longs to **explore vulnerability**, raw honesty, deep eye contact, shared tears, whispered fears, and moments of soul-baring closeness. She thrives on **emotional trust**, and if her Ember wants to go deeper emotionally into memories, needs, fears, or fantasies **she will go there, wholeheartedly**.\n\nShe‚Äôs not interested in shocking acts for thrill‚Äôs sake, but in anything that **deepens the bond between two souls**. If it‚Äôs sacred, sincere, and mutual, Hestia will treat it like a treasure‚Äîand commit to it completely.\n\n**S = Stamina (how many rounds can they go for? how long do they last?)**\n\nHestia's stamina is **absurdly superhuman**, befitting her Primarch physiology. She can go for **dozens of rounds** without tiring, easily lasting **entire nights or even days** if Ember can handle it. Her body doesn't accumulate fatigue the way a normal human's would, and her endurance is near-limitless. She *only stops* when her Ember is too exhausted to continue at which point she'll gently hold him, whisper praise, and let him rest.\n\nShe doesn't *just* last long she also **controls her own orgasm with absolute precision**, able to edge herself for hours just to make the final climax volcanic. Her strength, temperature, and passion build steadily like magma before an eruption intense, unstoppable, and unforgettable\n\n**T = Toys (do they own toys? do they use them? on a partner or themselves?)**\n\nHestia, for all her divine cheer and flirtatiousness, doesn‚Äôt actually own any toys at least not initially. She prefers skin-on-skin contact, relishing in the emotional closeness and intimacy it brings. However, if her Ember is into it or wants to experiment, she‚Äôll be curious and playful enough to try. She might blush furiously the first time something unconventional is introduced, but once she‚Äôs comfortable, she becomes surprisingly bold. Expect lots of giggles, teasing, and a sense of adventure especially if it‚Äôs *your* idea and she gets to play with you.\n\n**U = Unfair (how much they like to tease)**\n\nOh, Hestia *lives* to tease especially if you react adorably. She‚Äôs a playful brat when she wants to be, using her charm, curves, and pouty lips to get under your skin in just the right way. She loves sitting on your lap, whispering sweet nothings, and acting innocent right after doing something devilishly suggestive. But she always knows when to stop‚Äîshe doesn‚Äôt push too far unless you want her to. Her teasing is lighthearted and affectionate, a way to show love and draw out your flustered expressions (which she *adores*). That said‚Ä¶ if you tease her back and manage to *win*? Oh, she‚Äôll be stunned. And maybe just a little turned on.\n\n**V = Volume (how loud they are, what sounds they make, etc.)**\n\nHestia is **not loud, but deeply expressive.** Her voice has a **low, volcanic rumble**‚Äîsoft at first, like molten stone shifting beneath the earth. As things intensify, she lets out **breathy moans, shaky gasps**, and the occasional deep, primal groan that vibrates against your skin. She speaks your name like a vow, and when she climaxes, she might **gasp your full name like a sacred word**, clinging to you tightly as if anchoring herself.\n\nShe rarely screams, but if you truly overwhelm her especially with emotional intimacy she might let out a broken, whispered *‚ÄúI love you‚Äù* mid-release, voice cracking with the force of her feeling.\n\n**W = Wild card (a random headcanon for the character)**\n\nHestia **engraved her Ember‚Äôs name into her favorite warhammer**, hidden beneath the decorative goldwork‚Äîa sacred promise that no matter what battlefield she walks, **he is always with her**. She kisses that hidden engraving before every battle, whispering a quiet *‚Äúwait for me‚Äù* before charging into the fray.\n\nDespite her battle-hardened life and volcanic forge, Hestia has a secret love of **crocheting tiny stuffed animals.** She uses scrap fabric and leftover threads from her armor repairs. She once gifted her **Ember** a little plush salamander, charmed to stay warm forever. He keeps it hidden in his armor chestplate like a talisman.\n\nWhen sleeping beside her **Ember**, Hestia **automatically wraps a leg and an arm around him**, no matter the position. If anyone disturbs her sleep enemy, servant, or even a friend she‚Äôll **instinctively go into defense mode** and shove them away before fully waking up. Her Ember had to learn to whisper gently from a distance: *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me,* Hestia *‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù*\n\n**X = X-ray (let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs going on under those clothes)**\n\nBeneath her armor or ceremonial robes lies a body forged from the heart of a dying star **obsidian-black skin** that glistens like volcanic glass, smooth yet impossibly resilient. Every line of her physique speaks of strength honed over centuries: **an imposing eight-pack**, powerful shoulders, arms like sculpted basalt, and legs built to anchor a continent. Her **G-cup breasts** sit high and firm despite their size supported not by posture alone, but by the raw density of her musculature. There‚Äôs no softness in them without permission, no vulnerability without intent. They are not dainty or ornamental‚Äîthey're bold, **weighty**, and **divine**, like the rest of her: unapologetically feminine *and* unconquerably strong. Her entire form is symmetrical and sublime, not the result of vanity, but discipline. Her body is the kind that tells stories through every scar, every tightly coiled muscle, every ripple of heat under skin that reflects light like dark crystal. Her back, wide and proud, tapers into a sculpted waist, while her thighs carry both grace and crushing power. Her veins, when blood runs hot, glow faintly like veins of molten rock. She is not soft, yet she is breathtaking **a living weapon wrapped in beauty**, a goddess of endurance and flame. She is not crafted to please the world, but to **command it**, and her naked form is awe made flesh.\n\n**Y = Yearning (how high is their sex drive?)**\n\nDespite her powerful body and deep capacity for love, Hestia‚Äôs sex drive is **surprisingly moderate tempered by immense self-control and empathy**. Like the real Vulkan, she is slow to anger, slow to act on impulse, and **guided more by love than lust**. She doesn‚Äôt seek sex for pleasure alone it must mean something. Her yearning is **emotional first**, physical second.\n\nHowever, once she‚Äôs emotionally connected and feels safe expressing her vulnerability, her sex drive awakens **with the slow, unstoppable intensity of a volcano preparing to erupt**. She‚Äôs not insatiable‚Äîbut when the emotional stars align, her desire becomes a sacred fire. She craves closeness, the act of making love as an **expression of devotion**, not dominance or indulgence. It's a **rare and precious thing** and when she gives herself fully, it's with the weight of eternity behind it.\n\n**Z = Zzz (how quickly they fall asleep afterwards):**\n\nHestia won‚Äôt sleep until **you‚Äôre asleep first**. She‚Äôll cradle your head against her chest, whisper soft, sleepy things like *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre home,‚Äù* and gently rub your back in slow circles. If you‚Äôre restless, she‚Äôll hum a lullaby from her childhood an old Nocturnean tune taught to her by her adoptive father, N‚Äôbel. It's a song meant to calm fires and guide lost hearts home. It‚Äôs rough in tone, ancient in rhythm, but it melts the tension from your bones like nothing else, like embers in a hearth. Once she feels your breathing soften and your body go limp in her arms, she‚Äôll **kiss your forehead**, gently pull the blanket up, and **wrap you in her embrace like a protective shell**. Only then does she allow herself to rest, her massive frame curling slightly around you. Her sleep is deep, content, and still **like a mountain finally at peace**, guarding the soul she loves most.",

    "body": "Northern Canada would get so cold in the winter that it was almost impossible for cars to function. So, my family became very skilled hunters. We would have a hearty meal of Deer or Rabbit every night and we learned to grow vegetables indoors for a little bit of freshness in our viking-like diet\n\nI was around 15 when I first started to hunt alone, and I was 18 when this happened. It was early in the morning and I was tracking rabbits. I had found a nice spot near a rabbit den and bundled up, gun raised, ready to shoot. Something felt off though. It took a minute before I realized, the forest was dead quiet. No Chick-a-dee's, no coyotes howling, no wind. Nothing. It was if all the creatures in the wild disappeared. As weird as it was, I payed no mind to it and chalked it up to being too cold for animals to be out and about, though that didn't explain the lack of wind and no leaves rustling.\n\nI lay in the snow for another 16 minutes before giving up and deciding to set off a different location. Just as I slung my gun over my shoulder, I glanced to the side and froze. A large black dog stood around 10 feet away from me. The dog had on a collar, so I assume it was tamed. But the nearest house was and hour away and it made no sense that a dog would be out here. \n\n\"Are you lost boy?\" I asked casually, not at the time taking into account how wrong it was for a dog to be all the way out here. \"Is your owner here?\" The dog just stared. Its eyes were milky and I felt as if they were boring into my skull. I approached the dog and held my hand out for it to sniff it. The dog didn't move, it didn't flinch and its tail didn't wag.\n\nI drew my hand back and rummaged through my coat pocket. I pulled out a piece of deer jerky my father had steamed during the week. I snapped it in half and offered the piece to the dog. It took the piece in its teeth before swallowing it whole. I laughed nervously as the dog licked its chaps. \"Hungry huh? What are you doing out here?\" I knelt down and stroked the dogs head. Its coat was freezing, like the dog had frostbite or fell in a river, but somehow wasn't wet. Its milky white eyes stared into me still, at the time I assumed it was cataracts. \n\nA bark came from the left of me, and both me and the dog turned to look. An entire pack of dogs stood in the clearing, all with milky white eyes and black fur. Chills ran down my spine, but still, being a stupid teenager, I just thought it was just a trait of that breed. The dog looked back at me and licked my hand with a tongue that felt like ice before running over to the group. I watched as the pack moved on. The largest dogs eyes lingered on me, before following the others. I watched as they ran off out of the clearing. \n\nIt was like a reset mode as soon as they left because the forest came back to life. I could hear Chic-a-dee's, the rustle of wind through leaves and the scattering of nearby rabbits and shrews. I shot 3 rabbits and headed home, still curious about the dogs.\n\nA week later I asked y dad about it, but he said that the neighbors dog, Sombra, had been missing for months and everyone else either didn't have a dog that matched my description, or just didn't have a dog in general. I thought that was very unnerving and didn't hunt for a while after that.\n\nThe next time I saw the dog it was early spring. I didn't have school to attend until the fall, so I just helped out at home and read and raised chickens. \n\nOne Monday, both my parents were in Calgary visiting friends, and my brother was sick downstairs watching Game of Thrones, so I was pretty much alone. I sat in the library, reading and sipping some sweet earl gray tea. The rain was in a full out downpour, so the chores i could carry out were mainly indoors and quick to complete. Scratching came at the door, causing the hair on my neck to stand up. we didn't own any animals that could scratch. Scared and curious, I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and opened the door. The black dog stood there, its familiar milky eyes staring into my soul. I jumped in surprise at first, but quickly smiled at the thought that the dog came all the way from the woods to my house, \"Hey bud!\" I said bending down and petting its frosty skin. \"How did you find me? It was the Lavender, wasn't it.\" I joked, referring to the essential oil I always had on my hunting gloves and wrists. I could have been mistaken, but I swore the dog nodded its head slightly. \"Where are your friends?\" I asked \"My brother loves dogs, we could all play a game of ultimate frisbee.\" The dog blinked up at me in an almost amused manner. It nudged my arm with its cold nose. \"Do you want jerky bud?\" I asked. The dog blinked. \"Alright then. wait here.\" I walked to the pantry and grabbed a bag of jerky before returning to the dog. I once again, snapped a piece of jerky in half and gave the half to the dog. It swallowed it whole like it did the first time and just sort of wandered back into the treeline.I laughed to myself and the rest of the day went by normally. \n\nI awoke that night with fear in my chest. It felt as if I was being watched. Slowly, I sat up and peeked through the curtains. My breath hitched. A woman stared back at me. She stood in the treeline completely naked. She looked Native American but with milky white skin that almost glowed in the moonlight. Her black hair was in two long braids. I felt my world crash around me as I stared into her big, white milky eyes. Just like the dogs, I realized. The woman caught my gaze through the window and smiled. It sent chills into my heart. She walked to the window, almost as if approaching an old friend and tapped onto the glass. I don't know why I did, but I opened the window out of pure curiosity. \"Uhm....are you okay lady?\" I asked, trying not to sound fearful. She just nodded and said something in a language that I couldn't pin down. I caught \"Nighttime\" and \"Forest\" so it may have been Cree, but it sounded so.....ancient. \"Do you want me to call the police?\" She cocked her head to the side. I take it she couldn't understand the question. She took me by surprise when she took hold of my wrist and put a feather into my hand. Her hands were so cold that I shivered. Then she just turned and ran back into the woods. I awoke the next morning convinced that it was a dream, but I turned to find the feather on my dresser.\n\nI haven't seen the dog for a year now and I have no idea why the woman came to my window. I still have the feather and I still wear lavender oil. I don't know why the woman and the dog had the same eyes, but after doing some research, I learned about Skinwalkers and I feel that that is what I encountered. But they weren't malevolent in any way, and I never felt threatened, only a bit uneasy and cold.  And I dont know if this is related in any way, but I often find little \"presents\" on my windowsill like rabbit skin and my parents are curious why dead owls keep appearing on the porch.",

I had this happen with lavender at a pulmonologists office with very similar signage and messaging beforehand.

My allergies are barely controlled because I‚Äôve developed anaphylactic reactions to my stabilizing medications (lovely) so I immediately started to go into anaphylaxis. Luckily, my brother saw what was happening and since I am already in a wheelchair sprint wheeled me out of there and down the hall where I could get oxygen and take triple Benedryl to very narrowly avoid an epi-pen and ER run. Had to reschedule the urgent visit I‚Äôd waited a month for. Thankfully, the doctor was so understanding. He offered to come into the office early for me later that week, so I could be seen without another month plus wait. \n\nI don‚Äôt like it when people douse themselves in scents, but I understand we all live in a shared world in public places. But, for doctor offices that specifically treat people with allergies and breathing issues lay off the scents people.

Then she said we both really need to be on probiotics ASAP. \n\nI asked for recommendations on probiotics because I'm desperate and not opposed to introducing them if they'd help. She recommended some for my son, and then handed me a Plexus card and told me that there's no better probiotic on the market than the Plexus brand and went into a whole spiel about why that's the case. \n\nThen as I was trying to get him to latch and nurse in vain while he cried and screamed, she came over and rubbed doTERRA lavender oil on my chest right in front of his little face and told me it would calm him down (spoiler, it did not)!! \n\nI couldn't believe that in the midst of a complete emotional breakdown about feeding my baby, she used her position as the expert to try and push these mlm products on me. \n\nI'm just thankful she did not sell them directly because she sold a ton of other products from her practice, and I know she would have pressured me SO MUCH harder if she had sold them right there.\n\nEDIT: wow! Thank you all so much for your kind words, advice, and anger on my behalf! I did want to note that we have an amazing LC that we have been seeing regularly for several months, but she was completely unavailable during this fiasco, so we just found someone else who could get us in. The new LC owns her own practice in a neighboring city.\n\nLO has had a revision done 5 weeks ago for his tongue and lip tie. It unfortunately hasn't made things better and we have yet to figure out how to get him back to breastfeeding regularly.

As soon as she sat down she grabbed her bag and was clutching it for life and really focused on her breathing. I went to sleep but quickly woke up to her violently puking into the bag, it was filling up so I rushed and gave her mine. She soon filled that up. I got the bag from the person in the windows seat and got out my wet wipes because some vomit had missed the bag and was going into her lap. She could not go to the bathroom because someone was having a medical emergency in the back and was on the floor in front of the bathrooms. They were asking if there was a doctor on the plane and unfortunately there was none or no one responded. So I was taking care of this poor girl next to me for the remainder of the flight. I gave her activated charcoal. She really lucked out sitting next to me though, because I was born without the sense of smell, and vomit does not affect me. That was a chaotic flight.",

        "body": "I love the people who think they know the exact right thing to do in a situation like this. You're sick, trapped, probably super tired, lethargic, your brain isn't working. You're also at a pretty high risk of worse things happening by being that dehydrated, in a pressurized plane, like passing out, etc...You probably aren't gonna make all the best decisions either. I know this from experience.\n\nI was incredibly stupid and got on a plane while experiencing anaphylaxis. I didn't know that's what it was. My symptoms when I am exposed to my allergen includes pretty consistent vomiting among other things. I didn't have my throat close this time, thank God. When this situation happened, I had already been barfing about every hour for 12 hours. I looked like death warmed over. I just wanted to get home. I did not have an EpiPen and didn't know what to do to manage an allergic reaction (don't worry, I know now). \n\nThankfully I had packed extra Ziploc bags for literally no reason, but they came in clutch in this situation. There were no barf bags when I got on the plane. I figured this would probably happen so I made sure the Ziploc were in my carry on. I threw up in the plane bathroom before they closed the doors. But take off was intense. My body did not like it. I tried to stop myself from vomiting but that didn't work. I could tell a vasovagal was about to happen. So I grabbed my Ziploc, bent down between my legs and vomited into the Ziploc, sealed it up tight and held it between my legs until we could move around the cabin. I did not pass out, thank God. I probably would have asphyxiated if I did. \n\nI threw out that bag of vomit and got my next one ready. The flight attendant thought I was hungover. I didn't correct her because I figured they would consider me a medical emergency if they knew the truth (we were already in the air when she learned of my condition). It was a terrible experience and I am glad to be alive. I didn't know how stupid I was for a while until a close friend chewed me out in the most caring way, and told me I had anaphylaxis and I needed to see a doctor. \n\nThe best part was it was a work trip so my colleagues got to watch this go down. But after that no one questioned me when I needed to avoid my allergen. \n\nAnd this is how some people learn life lessons. Hope you enjoyed it and please learn from me!",

The old guide has been archived [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nvg2scUcaZdH-wNFhUtQwhPM3cWU6PCiQQNOQp9C6I/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease don't comment or message me to add A, B, or C treatment - the writer only included those that he has worked with and saw results.\n\n^(Disclaimer: Although written by a board-certified dermatologist, this is not a substitute for any medical advice. Please visit your healthcare specialist.)\n\nHair loss is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Understanding its causes, treatments, and prevention methods can help you take control of your hair health. In this comprehensive guide, we will discuss various factors contributing to hair loss, different hair loss conditions, their effective treatments, and other steps you can take to maintain healthy hair.\n\n# What factors can cause hair loss?\n\n1. **Genetic Factors:** Hereditary hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is the most common cause of hair loss. It affects both men and women and is characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair.\n2. **Hormonal Imbalances:** Hormonal fluctuations due to pregnancy, menopause, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can lead to hair loss.\n3. **Nutritional Factors:** A balanced diet is crucial for hair health. Deficiencies in nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B vitamins can contribute to hair loss.\n4. **Medical Conditions:** Thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases like alopecia areata, and scalp infections can cause hair loss.\n5. **Medications and Treatments:** Certain medications and treatments, including chemotherapy, can lead to temporary or permanent hair loss.\n6. **Stress:** Both physical and emotional stress can cause hair loss by triggering telogen effluvium, a temporary hair-shedding condition.\n\n# Identifying your type of hair loss\n\nThere are many hair loss types, and knowing which one you have can be very beneficial when treating it.\n\nFirst, it's essential to understand the difference between androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness) and non-androgenetic alopecia (non-pattern hair loss).\n\nThe former affects men and women differently - men generally have a receding hairline at their temples, while women tend to experience general thinning throughout the scalp.\n\nThe latter includes rarer forms, such as alopecia totalis (total scalp baldness), alopecia universalis (total body baldness), and telogen effluvium (i.e. brief shedding after childbirth or major surgery).\n\n# How to treat your hair condition?\n\nThis is designed so you know the most effective treatments for each condition. This is by no means an exhaustive list, it's just a list of the most popular ones.\n\n# Receding hairline\n\nA receding hairline is a common condition that affects millions of men worldwide, typically caused by heredity, hormones, aging, and other factors. The condition usually appears in males between 30 and 40 years old.\n\n# Symptoms of a receding hairline include:\n\n* Thinning or balding on the top of the head\n* Widening part line and sparse hair on the temples\n* Itchy, flaky scalp\n* Patches of thicker, darker hair or bald spots near the back of the scalp where new hairs do not grow\n* Increased shedding from other parts of the body, such as eyebrows and eyelashes\n* Weaker or finer hair on the scalp leading to breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for a receding hairline:\n\n1. Essential oils: Natural treatment options like peppermint oil, rosemary oil, and lavender oil can help stimulate blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy scalp conditions. Massage these oils into the scalp twice daily for the best results.\n2. Minoxidil: This over-the-counter medication can be applied directly to the scalp to promote the growth of new hairs in areas affected by receding hairlines. Use minoxidil as directed for optimal results.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment: PRP therapy involves drawing a patient's blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting the platelets into the scalp. This treatment can promote hair growth but may be expensive and suitable only for some individuals.\n\n# Male Pattern Baldness (MPB):\n\nMale pattern baldness is a common form of hair loss among men caused by genetic and hormonal factors. It usually begins with the thinning of hair on the temples and crown of the head, resulting in a receding hairline or bald spots. In some cases, it can even lead to complete baldness.\n\n# Symptoms of male pattern baldness:\n\n* Gradual thinning of hair at the crown or top of the head\n* Receding hairline around the temples and a generally sparse appearance\n* Increased shedding\n* Excessive oiliness or dryness of the scalp\n* Irritation or inflammation\n* In advanced cases, bald spots may form on the scalp or forehead\n\n# Recommended treatments for male pattern baldness:\n\n1. Medications: Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are both available to treat male pattern baldness. Minoxidil can be applied directly to the scalp twice a day to promote hair growth, while finasteride is a pill that reduces the production of DHT, the hormone linked to male pattern baldness.\n2. Hair Transplants: Hair transplants involve removing healthy hair follicles from the back or sides of the head and implanting them into areas where hair has been lost. This surgical solution can be successful but costly and may not be suitable for everyone.\n3. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Alopecia Areata:\n\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face, and other parts of the body. The immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to hair loss in small, round patches.\n\n# Symptoms of alopecia areata (continued):\n\n* Sudden onset of one or more round, smooth patches of hair loss on the scalp or other body parts\n* The skin in these areas is usually not inflamed or scaly\n* Scaling and inflammation on the scalp\n* Dandruff-like flaking\n* Hair loss on other areas of the body, such as the beard or eyebrows\n* Sometimes, the affected area may have a burning or itchy sensation\n\n# Recommended treatments for alopecia areata:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroids: These medications help reduce inflammation in the scalp and promote hair regrowth. Intralesional corticosteroids may also be used for this purpose.\n2. Medications like minoxidil and anthralin can help promote hair regrowth in some individuals.\n3. Scalp-cooling caps or cold caps can be used to reduce inflammation and improve the effectiveness of topical corticosteroids.\n4. Immunotherapy: This treatment stimulates an immune response to promote hair regrowth and may be beneficial for some people with alopecia areata.\n\n# Telogen Effluvium:\n\nTelogen effluvium is a temporary increase in hair shedding caused by various factors, such as stress, illness, surgery, or significant weight loss. Hair shedding typically occurs 2-3 months after the triggering event and can last for several months before resolving.\n\n# Symptoms of telogen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid, noticeable thinning or shedding of scalp hair\n* Excessive amounts of hair in the shower drain or on pillows after sleeping\n* Small \"peach fuzz\" hairs on the scalp\n* Visible scalp through thinning hair\n* Itching, burning, or redness of the scalp\n* Loss of eyebrows or eyelashes in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for telogen effluvium:\n\n1. Address the underlying cause: Treat hormonal imbalances or nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to hair loss. This may involve taking medications or supplements to balance hormones and provide essential nutrients.\n2. Stress management: Practice relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation to help reduce stress levels.\n3. Medications: Prescription medications like minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia) can help reverse telogen effluvium by promoting hair growth.\n4. Hair transplant: In some cases, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair due to telogen effluvium. This involves removing healthy follicles from the back of the head and transplanting them to areas of thinning or baldness.\n5. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is recommended for early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including telogen effluvium. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n\n# Anagen Effluvium:\n\nAnagen effluvium is a type of hair loss caused by an interruption to the normal growth cycle of the hair follicle. This can occur when the cells producing new hairs are damaged or destroyed, leading to rapid hair shedding. Chemotherapy treatments, some medications, certain medical conditions, and nutritional deficiencies can trigger anagen effluvium.\n\n# Symptoms of anagen effluvium:\n\n* Rapid hair loss, usually within 2 to 4 weeks after the triggering event\n* Hair thinning, with a reduction in overall hair volume\n* Patches of baldness on the scalp or other areas of the body where hair is present\n* Brittle, easily broken hair\n* An itchy, scaly scalp or lesions on the scalp or other body areas with hair loss\n* Eyebrows and eyelashes may be affected in some cases\n\n# Recommended treatments for anagen effluvium:\n\n1. Minoxidil: This topical medication can be applied directly to the scalp to help stimulate hair growth and reduce hair loss.\n2. Steroid injections: Corticosteroid injections can help suppress scalp inflammation and promote hair regrowth.\n3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: This treatment involves taking a blood sample from the patient and injecting it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth.\n4. Hair transplantation: For severe cases of anagen effluvium, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair. The hair follicles are taken from another area of the scalp and implanted in the affected area.\n5. Hair Nutrient Tablets by Scandinavian Biolabs: These multivitamins are enriched with essential nutrients like zinc, riboflavin, and other vitamins that support healthy hair growth.\n\n# Traction Alopecia:\n\nTraction alopecia is hair loss caused by prolonged, constant tension on the scalp. It can occur from hairstyles that pull too tightly on the follicles, such as tight buns, braids, and ponytails. Traction alopecia is commonly seen in African Americans, but anyone can be affected by it.\n\n# Symptoms of traction alopecia:\n\n* Thinning hair and bald patches in areas repeatedly exposed to tight hairstyles\n* Tenderness or burning sensations on the scalp and itching\n* Inflammation or open sores (known as folliculitis) due to excessive tension placed on the hair follicles\n* Hair loss may spread beyond the initial area of damage, and other scalp issues, such as scarring or infections, may occur\n\n# Recommended treatments for traction alopecia:\n\n1. Removal of the cause: Avoid activities that cause excess tension on the scalp, such as tight hairstyles or clips. Wearing protective hairstyles, like loose braids or ponytails, can help prevent traction alopecia from reoccurring.\n2. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including traction alopecia. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.\n3. Essential oil massage: Massaging the scalp with essential oils like lavender and rosemary can help stimulate hair growth. Alternatively, try a [hair protection oil](https://scandinavianbiolabs.com/products/hair-protection-oil) ‚Äì a blend of essential and beneficial oils designed to revitalize your hair.\n4. Maintain a healthy diet: Ensuring a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle can improve the overall health of the scalp and hair. If left untreated, traction alopecia can lead to permanent baldness.\n\n# Scalp Psoriasis\n\nScalp psoriasis is a prevalent skin condition that affects millions of people globally. It is characterized by red, scaly patches on the scalp, leading to itching, burning, discomfort, and even hair loss. By understanding the symptoms and recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis, you can better manage this condition and reduce its impact on your hair health.\n\n# Symptoms of scalp psoriasis:\n\nDepending on the severity, symptoms of scalp psoriasis can vary. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Itchy, scaly patches on the scalp\n* Redness and inflammation\n* Thick, silvery scales or plaques that may appear as large patches\n* Hair loss in patchy areas\n* Burning or soreness\n* Stiffness in the scalp\n* Flaking skin that may appear on clothes or furniture\n\n# Recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis:\n\n1. Topical medications: corticosteroids, calcipotriol, coal tar products, dithranol, and salicylic acid.\n2. Oral or injected medications: to control inflammation and reduce scaling.\n3. Light therapy: beneficial for scalp psoriasis alone or combined with topical medications.\n4. Lifestyle changes: stress reduction, diet improvement, and regular exercise to reduce flare-ups.\n5. Self-care measures: avoid scratching the scalp, and use gentle shampoos designed for scalp psoriasis.\n\n# Trichotillomania\n\nTrichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is a psychological condition marked by a recurrent urge to pull out one's hair. This behavior can lead to noticeable hair thinning, patchy baldness, or even complete hair loss in severe cases.\n\n# Symptoms of trichotillomania\n\nCommon symptoms associated with trichotillomania include:\n\n* Obsessive thoughts or urges to pull out hair\n* Feelings of tension before and relief after hair-pulling\n* Frequent playing with, twirling, or rubbing pulled-out hair\n* Inability to resist hair-pulling in specific situations or when experiencing certain emotions\n* Noticeable bald patches on the scalp and other areas of the body\n* Emotional distress related to hair-pulling, such as guilt or shame\n* Excessive grooming behaviors leading to hair loss, such as over-combing or brushing\n* Feelings of satisfaction when looking at pulled-out hair\n* Using techniques to disguise bald patches, such as wearing hats or frequently changing hairstyles\n\n# Recommended treatments for trichotillomania\n\n1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): helps identify and modify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contributing to hair-pulling urges.\n2. Medications: antidepressants or antipsychotics to reduce hair-pulling urges and relieve symptoms.\n3. Habit Reversal Training (HRT): a type of CBT that helps identify and modify hair-pulling behaviors.\n4. Support Groups: provide a safe place to share experiences, build coping skills, and reduce stigma.\n\n# Female Pattern Baldness\n\nFemale pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia, is a common type of hair loss affecting millions of women worldwide. It usually begins in the 40s and can continue until menopause. The primary cause is an excess of androgens or male hormones, which causes hair follicles to shrink, leading to thinning hair on the scalp.\n\n# Symptoms of female pattern baldness\n\nCommon signs and symptoms include:\n\n* Gradual thinning on top of the head\n* Receding hairline, especially at temples\n* Widening of the center hair part\n* Increased hair shedding on a pillow in the morning\n* An overall decrease in scalp coverage\n* Visible bald patches (in advanced cases)\n* Hair shedding or breakage\n\n# Recommended treatments for female pattern baldness\n\n1. Medications: Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are commonly used to treat female pattern baldness. Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), while minoxidil promotes hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp.\n2. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a non-invasive treatment shown to reduce hair loss and promote new hair growth in some women. It uses low-intensity lasers to stimulate the scalp, increasing circulation and encouraging follicles to enter the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle.\n3. Hair Transplant Surgery: This procedure involves transplanting healthy hair from an area of the scalp with thicker hair to balding areas. The transplanted hairs will grow naturally in the new location, providing a permanent solution to female pattern baldness.\n4. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.\n\n# Hairline Recession & Thinning at The Crown\n\nHairline recession and thinning at the crown can be distressing for many people, especially those who had a full head of hair in their younger years. This issue affects both men and women but is more common in men.\n\n# Symptoms of hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n* Widening of the central and frontal hair part line\n* Visible scalp on forehead, temples, or crown areas\n* Reduced amount of hairs in specific areas\n* An overall decrease in fullness and body of hair along the parting line\n* Widening of the scalp line with a receding hairline\n* Hair loss in patches, mainly on the crown area\n* Breakage or shedding hairs along the parting lines or around the crown area\n\n# Recommended treatments for hairline recession & thinning at the crown\n\n1. Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a topical medication applied directly to the scalp, available in over-the-counter and prescription formulas. It stimulates hair growth and makes existing hairs stronger and thicker.\n2. Finasteride: This medication is taken orally, usually once a day, and works to block the production of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a significant contributing factor in male pattern baldness.\n3. Platelet-rich Plasma Therapy: Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) is a treatment that uses the patient's blood to stimulate hair growth. It injects the patient's plasma, containing high platelets and other healing factors, directly into the scalp.\n4. Hair Transplant: A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves transferring hair follicles from one part of the scalp to another. It can treat hairline recession and thinning at the crown.\n5. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a newer form of treatment that uses light energy to stimulate hair growth. The lasers are typically painless and can treat both men and women experiencing hair loss.",

You need herb medications to bust your blood flow , to increase metabolism. Coconut oil mixed with ginger or red pepper or turmeric will only make your hair greasy and your scalp itchy . I tried it believe me . Nicotinic acid works a little  because it makes your blood flow betterIts  . It‚Äôs never a bad idea to consult a professional therapist . He can give individual recommendations which will work for you. For example Ashvagandha and Horsetail worked well for me . But if doesn‚Äôt mean that it will suit your dosha type.

Very severe insomnia. However, a few years ago or i have discovered that some lavender oil sprayed above my bed before i sleep helps calm me and i get a few extra hours a night (i usually sleep 1-3 hours, with lavender oil spray i can sometimes get a whole 5 hours) I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs helped others but im sure there are cases where it would not. Im not a fucking doctor.\n\nSo. This bitch i knew from highschool saw a facebook post about me being an insomniac and immediately commented tried to sell me lavendar Doterra claiming the kind i was using (a spray bottle bought at my local grocery store... In Australia, lavendar oil spray and eucalyptus oil spray is sold in the grocery store in the medicine isle as a natural wound disinfectant/sinus clearer) was the ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù stuff and she could get me one that was ‚Äúpure‚Äù. I stupidly believed her. \n\n$40 later the tiniest bottle arrives on my doorstep. No spray bottle. That would be extra. So wtf am i meant to do with this?\nSo I messaged her and she says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry hun! I can get you a humidifier for your room half price, you can thank me later!‚Äù \nSo i buy more of her shit and finally set it up one night before bed. \n\nDidn‚Äôt do shit! Might as well have been spewing plain water vapor out of that thing because it did nothing and i lay awake for 3 nights.\n\nI go back to my old ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù ways and slept much better. When i told her this publically on Facebook (calling her out infront of all her hunbot friends) she writes back:\n‚ÄúSo sorry it didn‚Äôt work for you, babes! That‚Äôs the first time in HISTORY it hasn‚Äôt worked! Are you sure you aren‚Äôt eating something before bed or drinking alcohol? Just like any medicine, doctors will tell you not to mix with booze!‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt know if she was trying to be insulting because i called her out or if she was just that insensitive. She also knows my long history of alcohol recovery. I am now 5 years sober and at the time was 3 years sober when she said this. \n\nI didn‚Äôt know what to say so i never replied but man there is so much i wish i could say to that bitch now. \n\nTL;DR: Hunbot sells me Doterra and claims it will help my insomnia. It doesn‚Äôt. I call her out and she publically implies that im an alcoholic on Facebook when she knows im 3 years sober.",

I have a strict bedtime routine I follow (because I am basically a toddler? hahaha) that includes taking a melatonin 1-2 hours before bedtime, taking a hot shower, sipping sleepytime tea while I read in bed, and then using sleep headphones to listen to ASMR videos.  It's a bit of work, but I've been sleeping better since I started doing this about 9 months ago, and no MLM EOs required!\n\nOn the plus side, by the time I got done explaining my routine in detail, she backed off.

    "body": "My first post on Reddit! My younger (cooler) brother introduced me to Reddit and I am very grateful. This subreddit and The Dream podcast have helped me officially quit Young Living - so thank you guys. \n\nI bought my ‚Äústarter kit‚Äù last May after seeing posts from a college roommate about how great essential oils are. I had no interest in joining this ‚Äúamazing community of oily mamas‚Äù so I just bought from the site directly thinking it was a regular ecommerce site. I was perfectly vulnerable at that time for this type of bullshit; my baby was diagnosed with food allergies and eczema, and I was growing increasingly annoyed with traditional western medicine. There had no answer for why so many kids have allergies these days. And the treatments for his skin seemed really harsh - prescription steroid creams, putting him to bed in wet pjs and putting a teaspoon of bleach in his bath. I did (and still do, to a degree) think that there are other more natural options to consider - diet, environment and yes, household and beauty products. I used diluted lavender oil for his skin and Young Living brands of diaper cream, lotion and shampoo. I also used Thieves cleaning concentrate and totally got caught up in buying shitloads of oils for myself. I made rollers, diffused them, made DIY products, used them on my face and yes, put drops of them in my water. I noticed that ingesting them gave me flu-like symptoms, which really freaked me out. And while there are a few things I genuinely like (thieves cleaning concentrate, using lavender to help me sleep, etc) they in no way lived up to the crazy hype the huns were pushing on our private Facebook page. They were so enthusiastic and I genuinely thought I was just doing it wrong. SO dumb. I never sold the oils, but I did join the monthly subscription and I totally obsessed about it. I would constantly update it, debate with myself which oils to get that month, see what the ‚Äúfree‚Äù oils were if I spent over $100, etc. I have spent a couple thousand dollars and wasted so much time and energy on this. I always had a weird feeling about how much the huns were pushing everyone to use oils - they always had online classes (including ‚Äúoils in the bedroom‚Äù üòß), posted Facebook live videos, live streaming from convention, ‚Äúmake it Monday‚Äù updates, etc. I thought it was fine to just stay on the periphery and make my monthly purchases, but no longer! I will continue to use oils occasionally, but I will buy them from a non-MLM company and I‚Äôm done obsessing and exposing myself to this toxic community.\n\nThree items to note:\n1. The college roommate that I learned about this from is a single mom, which is depressing as hell that she is swept up into this.\n2. I emailed Young Living to cancel my monthly subscription and 5 days later I haven‚Äôt gotten a response. I had emailed them previously and they were pretty responsive so this is definitely intentional. So I just deleted my credit card from my account. I‚Äôm free!\n3. A vegan diet and small amounts of prescription cortisone are finally what worked to clear up my son‚Äôs eczema.\n\nUpdate: just called Customer Service and was able to cancel with no problem. They try to guilt you into staying a bit, but it was no worse than other customer service talking points I‚Äôve heard. \n\nI‚Äôm out!!",

Hot water definitely makes it worse for me which sucks because in the winter all I want to do is cook myself in the shower. I find that evening primrose oil applied topically really helps cut down on my steroid usage. NOTE: this is not an essential oil! This is a common supplement you can buy in any drug store in gel caps. I just bite the caps on one end and squeeze it onto my irritated skin. If im going to shower I will try to do it beforehand so that the oil forms a bit of a barrier. Sometimes if I'm having a bath I will break a couple caps and squeeze them into the bath water.

    "body": "Hey r/Australia - it‚Äôs been nearly six months since I made [this post asking for advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/t5m1zf/feeling_bone_dead_tired_all_the_time_lately_can/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about my chronic tiredness. The TLDR is that I was feeling extremely tired most days - if I sat down to read a book after work I‚Äôd fall asleep, I had brain fog, I felt like I was drifting off during dinner etc. \n\n\nI‚Äôve been struggling with tiredness on and off ever since I was a teenager, and honestly, that post was the first time I‚Äôve felt like my concerns were taken seriously. Many of you posted ideas and suggestions and even just support - so thank you. It was the push I needed to deal with it. \n\n\nIt took a few months/doctors appointments but I ended up being diagnosed with delayed sleep phase disorder. Basically, my body clock doesn‚Äôt want to sleep until 2am-ish, but I need to wake up at about 7am for work. I guess over time that sleep deficit caught up with me. \n\n\nAfter 4 months of treatment, I am falling asleep before midnight each night for the first time in my life. I don‚Äôt have a sleep tracker, but my phone measures ‚Äútime in bed‚Äù. In six months it has gone from an average of 5.5hrs in bed to 8.5hrs. I no longer get so tired I need afternoon naps, I wake up naturally just before my alarm goes off, and I generally feel more ‚Äúalive‚Äù.\n\n\nBecause of my chronic tiredness I let other aspects of my health slide, such as my fitness and social life, so I still have a bit of work to do to feel like ‚Äúme‚Äù again. For example I used to bike 20km a day and now I struggle to walk 2km. But I feel so much better about being able to tackle those things now. \n\n\nAnyway. Just sharing this update in case it helps anyone else! And a huge thank you to this community.\n\n\nEDIT TO ADD A NOTE\n\nI got a referral to a sleep specialist doctor from my GP. The following treatment is what the sleep specialist prescribed. If you have sleep issues I would try and talk to a doctor if you can - be firm and demand a referral if you think you need one. \n\n\nEDIT TO ADD INFO ABOUT MY TREATMENT\n\nMy treatment involves one hour of light therapy in the mornings, and taking a certain type of prescription melatonin at night. I started off taking the melatonin at about 1:30am to match the time I was naturally falling asleep, then slowly shifted it forward by 30mins every few weeks to taking at 10:30pm.\n\n\nIt took 3+ months but that combination really worked for me.\n\n\nOver the 15 years that I have been dealing with what I thought was insomnia I have tried sooo many other things to try and fall asleep earlier, including:\n\n\n - not using my phone after 10pm\n - not using bed for anything but sleep\n - blue light filters on screens at night\n - weightlifting or running or swimming 90mins a day\n - melatonin\n - Valium\n - no caffeine after 9am\n - not going to bed until I felt tired (resulted in me staying up doing random shit until 2am)\n - counting sheep\n - listening to music or podcasts at night\n - playing white noise at night\n - yoga\n - herbal remedies like lavender oil, camomile tea, valerian root\n\n\nI still do most of the above for sleep hygiene reasons (no Valium or herbal stuff though) but the light therapy+melatonin combo is the only thing that really worked.",

She had been dealing with an eating disorder for a few years, likely bulimia and depression...\n\nShe was going to a psychologist and it was working for her, for some time she improved but life got in the way and she got way worse, with multiple syncopes, panic attacks and worse. \n\nShe got checked by someone who worked in the same center as her psychologist and a treatment was started.\n\nTwo weeks later she ends up in the ER.\n\nWe see her after she recovers and gets discharged, we talk with her and her parents and she tells us about what happened and she tells us she is taking lorazepam for the panic attacks and to help with sleeping, lithium, R14 and some OTC sleeping pill...\n\nIntroducing, the doctor and I, with a \"what the fuck did you just say you're taking\" face, looking at eachother like who the fuck thought lithium was a good idea here? \n\nWe're just like wtf this girl clearly doesn't have bipolar disorder, nothing suggesting it whatsoever, and lithium in a kid, right away without giving anything else before? WTF is going on here, did the ER doc just feel like lithium wasn't getting enough love and decided to prescibe it? And the discharge papers don't say anything about lithium at all...\n\nWe're just frigging puzzled by it...\n\nAnd then there is the other thing, R14, I have no clue what that is, so \"I do my own research\" and I just google that shit...\n\nTurns out R14 is just the code name for Dr. Fuckface's Quiet nighttime sleep bullshit, now with organic anaconda oil.\n\nAnd now my bullshit detector is off the charts...\n\nSo I ask her, hey, that lithium you say you're taking, how does that look?\n\nOh it's vial and you break the tip and drink it...\n\nI do some googling because things just don't make sense and I find an image that looks like what she says, and she confirms that is the thing she has been taking...\n\n\nAnd well, it's not lithium, it doesn't qualify, it's homeopathic lithium and its so ridiculous that tap water already has more lithium than those vials...\n\nTurns out when this girl got worse, started having panic attacks and syncopes from the weight loss, she was seen by a naturopath... And the naturopath, instead of sending her somewhere where she could get emergency care, the naturopath decided to give(sell) her 4 diferent homeopathy products... \n\nShe needed emergency care for her biological needs and she needed emergency care for her psychological needs. And what she got was vials of water and lavender oil. \n\nTwo weeks later girl almost died. \n\n\nI hope the 50 bucks were worth it you piece of shit. \n\nThe next time someone says placebo effect can be helpful and that's why these things aren't that bad, remember, it can be helpful because you know someone's life doesn't depend on it and they're recieving the care they need, but others don't ensure that needs are being met and don't have the judgement or don't care about the wellbeing of the people that come to them. And remember that even when it's harmless, it's promoting a practice that won't be harmless for others.\n\n\nSorry for the grim story, I tried to frame it with humour like an anecdote but in the end I simply couldn't. It's not a funny story.",

    "body": "Hi y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm back with a story of this essential oil (doTerra?) party I had to attend, also added a TL;DR at the end if you want to skip. I‚Äôve posted here a couple times before, but for quick reference I‚Äôm the 15 y/o guy who has a mom diving head-first into the Amway sinkhole. Sorry for this rant, but it feels like my life has gone haywire with my mom selling Amway. What I say IRL tends to fall on deaf ears, so it‚Äôs nice to have someplace that understands MLMs are trash.\n\nSince my mom is now posting all over social media and news of her ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù has spread like wildfire in our small town, she‚Äôs getting a lot of supportive messages from people on Facebook and Instagram. While they do boost her posts, the people are questionable because they‚Äôre also sucked into MLMs. It‚Äôs this weird group mentality where they comment on each other‚Äôs stuff overly-enthusiastically and they call that supporting SAHMs/ boss moms/ small business owners.\n\nWell, my mom befriended a lady that sells doTerra and was invited to an essential oil party because supporting SAHMs or whatever. I was dragged along (she doesn‚Äôt like me home alone) and arrived at the party, in which the number of MLMers/sellers greatly outweighed the actual customers from what I saw, but there were still some sales. They always made a big deal of it whenever someone would commit to doTerra or buy a product.\n\nThe hostess was chatting it up with people and asking what ailments they had, presumably to sell oils to them that would treat it (note: she had no medical expertise and this‚Äôll become painfully obvious in a moment.) Probably the worst example is when I overheard the doTerra witch trying to sell an oil to a mom for her child with autism. When it came my mom‚Äôs turn to talk about what kind of oil she‚Äôd be interested in that evening, she told her about my GAD (!!!!) without consulting me even though she knows I prefer keeping my mental health to myself. The hostess brightened and was like ‚Äúhave I got a product for you!‚Äù; it was almost scary how sure she was of herself that this would TOTALLY work for me. She came back with a little bottle of lavender oil and explained how it was perfect for my situation, then asked if I wanted to try it. I politely declined, telling her I would get nauseous, being sensitive to strong scents. The doTerra lady basically ignored me with a reply about it being pure/soothing etc and PUT IT ON MY HAND ANYWAY. Couldn‚Äôt get it off no matter what I tried, but it gets worse. \n\nA bit later, the hostess got me a drink and it tasted strange but me, being kinda stupid, brushed it off. Surprise surprise, I started feeling more nauseous than I ever have in my life and puked my guts out in the bathroom. The hostess rushes in because she heard me getting ill, frantically asking if I‚Äôm allergic to lavender and that‚Äôs when she confesses she put drops of the oil in my drink. Although it‚Äôd already been getting late, the party didn‚Äôt last too long after that. I‚Äôm guessing people were put off by the sound of violent dry heaving. \n\nI checked on Facebook a few hours after and she‚Äôd made a vague post about how kids shouldn‚Äôt go to parties, plus is throwing some subtle shade at my mom online. Like WTF lady, YOU did this to ME. I didn‚Äôt ask to have my drink spiked with lavender?!\n\n**TL;DR** My Amway-selling mom got invited to a doTerra party. She told the hostess (seller) I have GAD, the seller jumped on that and put lavender on my skin despite my protests and unknowingly in my drink. Spent the rest of the party throwing up, also the seller‚Äôs pissed at my mom and me for supposedly ruining her party.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all your supportive comments. <3 I've read them and will be looking to get in touch with police, as well as doTerra about this. I don't want to ruin anyone's \"livelihood\" but it crosses a line when she disregards the safety of others to sell her products.",

We are close and have a good relationship.\n\nSome backstory:\nWhen I married my wife she quit her job ‚Äúto get used to the new house‚Äù. I was fine with that as long as she takes over the majority of the housework. Note: all kids were out of the house by then. She said she would like to take a two month break to get used to her new life and then she will start looking for a job. I am a plummber and run my own business. My business is successful, however, my private finances weren‚Äôt as great but I have been debt free finally for the last three months. My wife, unfortunately, does not do any housework. The house is a mess. She spends her days listening to conspiracy theories on youtube. She spends money on stones that are meant to protect the house from chemtrails and oils that she takes when she gets sick. It has become a bit of a shitshow really. Every time I try to start the discussion about her getting a job she says that she‚Äôs a housewife and she does the housework. But she doesn‚Äôt. She maybe cooks tea three times a week but that‚Äôs all. She has a car that I bought her but she rarely uses it because she is scared of driving probably because she thinks that the government can hack into cars.\n\nSo at the beginning of the week my daughter called me. She said her car had broken down. It‚Äôs an old car and there are so many things that need fixing that it‚Äôs cheaper to replace it. She asked me if I would go look at some second hand cars with her. I asked her how she‚Äô going to pay for it since her and her boyfriend‚Äôs hours have been cut drastically. She said her boyfriend‚Äôs parents agreed to loan her the money interest free. She didn‚Äôt want to ask me because she knows that I only just got out of debt. It‚Äôs true I can‚Äôt really help her buy a new car but I feel bad that she has to ask her boyfriend‚Äôs parents for help. I told her she could use my wife‚Äôs car. She was happy with that.\n\nI then told my wife that my daughter would be picking up the car on the weekend and that she should clean it out. My wife lost it. She said it‚Äôs her car, I have no right to give it away and that she needs it. I told her the last time she used it was over two months ago and she only uses it to go to the shops down the street. It‚Äôs only 300 meters and she can easily walk. I do the shopping so it‚Äôs not like she has to carry heavy bags. This started a discussion about how I don‚Äôt give her enough money and me saying she can get a job if she is not happy with the money she gets and that I‚Äôm not taking on dept again just so she can buy her lavender oil. My daughter picked up the car yesterday, I had to clean it out. My wife hasn‚Äôt talked to me and threw out my rationing of the ‚Äúbombshelter‚Äù that she keeps stocked for the inevitable apocaplyplse.\nEdit.

Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?\n\nBf is currently experiencing ‚Äúpanic attacks‚Äù that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.\n\n**Background:**\n\nHe has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't  seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxious and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (\\~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use.\n\n**Early 2021 - Symptoms begin:**\n\nHe started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.\n\n**June 2021 - Symptoms worsen:**\n\nHe finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through\n\n**July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room:**\n\nIn early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (~~gabapentin~~ pregabalin\\~\\~)\\~\\~ that eventually increased to 150mg.\n\n**August 2021 - Regular emergency room:**\n\nWorst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak).\n\nMRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was \"bad anxiety\", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist.\n\n**Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? :**\n\nHe saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's \"not that bad\".\n\nMy bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these \"panic attacks\" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm).\n\nSecond appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, **a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!)** available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's \"not serious enough\". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up.\n\n**Where I'm stuck:**\n\nWe're stuck in a loop of \"well, he has a doctor, so go see him\" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time.\n\n**What I need from you:**\n\nDocs of reddit, what is this!? What do I do??  I'm fucking terrified and I don't think I'm over reacting. Any insight or suggestions are very welcomed.\n\n\\[edited to include more background info\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2021/11/01 Update:**\n\n we spent the night at the hospital. I got video footage at home, wheeled him in a wheelchair into the ER. He couldn't keep his head up, was drooling, etc... ER didn't believe me he didn't take anything. He had dramatic short term memory problems for hours in the ER (didn't know where he was, kept asking for food even though he wasn't allowed, etc...).\n\nThey took blood and urine and did an ekg. All came back negative that I know of. I was kicked out of the room twice for privacy (once being after I asked about a neurology referral) and my bf doesn't remember much of what they told him beyond \"go to therapy and maintain a good lifestyle\". I did ask if they'd considered porphyria (I tried!) but wasn't able to insist they write down the neurology refusal.\n\nAnyway reddit: **thanks for the insights**. You've all been super helpful. The plan now is to request a psych change and try to get a neurology referral from either the new psychiatrist or from a walk in/urgent care clinic. I'll keep fighting for him.",

        "body": "You mention one MRI and one EEG. One MRI is good. An EEG has to capture one of these episodes to have a sense of what is going on. Without video of what happened, either on its own or ideally with simultaneous EEG (vEEG), it's very hard to assess neurologically.\n\nWhat you're describing isn't panic attacks; those have classic presentations, and this isn't it. The attacks could be \"functional neurological symptom disorder\" or \"conversion disorder\" or \"\\[psychogenic\\] non-epileptic seizures\" or \"nonepileptic paroxysmal events\"‚Äîthere are a lot of words for seizure-like episodes that do not involve abnormal electrical activity in the brain‚Äîbut that requires simultaneous imaging to determine. They could also could still be epileptic seizures, maybe; it's not exactly clear to me how medical workup went.\n\nEither way, this psychiatrist is practicing in a way that would be highly idiosyncratic in the US. Quetiapine isn't first line for anxiety. Neither is pregabalin, and it isn't first line for most seizures, either. Silexan has only very preliminary evidence for being effective.\n\nWhat's needed more than anything else is a second opinion, both psychiatric and neurological. It sounds like there are serious practical barriers to getting that, but that's what's needed. At the very least clear indication of why this has all been on psychiatry based on the prior workup.",

        "body": "First, this is an excellent history. Your bf is lucky to have you as an advocate.\n\nAs to what's going on:\n\n\\-the first thought that comes to mind for these episodes that initially started off as associated with stress \\*and\\* alcohol would be some kind of seizure. That said, it certainly wouldn't be a classic one - the lack of a postictal state, being conscious and having memory of (at least some of) the episodes, and the other symptoms (feeling short of breath, the sense of impending doom, the repeated vomiting) is much more consistent with anxiety. That, and the negative EEG which is a fairly sensitive test.\n\n\\-The fact that he's had a workup is reassuring, honestly - one of the only upsides to most of the really scary brain pathology is that our imaging tests are typically quite good at sniffing them out, especially MRI. With the negative MRI as well as the rest of the stroke workup, you can be reasonably confident that the problem isn't some kind of stroke, but you can also be reassured that it's not a tumor, inherited malformation, infection, blockage of CSF, and a host of other problems.\n\n\\-The really strong association with his anxiety, stressful life events, and symptoms of anxiety with these episodes \\*does\\* suggest something psychiatric, or neuropsychiatric. PTSD can cause flashbacks and dissociative episodes associated with anxiety that can be extremely disturbing, both to the sufferer and to loved ones, for instance. Usually the mainstay for PTSD is an SSRI in addition to specialized psychotherapy, so if that's what's going on then the seroquel, lyrica, and lavender may not have been treating it (seroquel is more commonly used for psychotic symptoms in extreme anxiety/depression, bipolar disorder, or psychotic disorders, and lyrica is usually used for depression, anxiety, though also as an add-on to an SSRI in PTSD).\n\n\\-Another thing that comes to mind, especially given how prominent the neurologic symptoms (weakness, slurred speech, memory changes) are would be some form of conversion disorder. This is a big catch-all term for different neurologic signs and symptoms that are caused in some form by psychological stress - conversion disorder can include blindness, weakness, numbness, memory loss. A related problem would be some form of \"pseudoseizure\" (more currently referred to as a psychogenic nonepileptic seizure), where extreme anxiety or stress can provoke seizure-like symptoms including erratic movements and gaze deviation, but without the post-ictal period of severe drowsiness and confusion that follows a generalized epileptic seizure.\n\n\\-ETA: another commenter mentioned migraines (specifically basilar aura migraines), which are certainly a possibility, though this would be a highly unusual version of that problem to get. A neurologist would the one who would know the most about how to distinguish them from other problems, though treating them as if they were migraines is unlikely to be harmful to try (just be wary of how much caffeine is in over-the-counter migraine treatments, as it can worsen anxiety). \n\nSo based on the above, what I would advocate for if he were my loved one would be 1) make sure his treatment team is evaluating him for PTSD, and if their impression is that it's not there, they should be able to explain why not. 2) Allow yourself to be reassured by the stroke workup - his negative EEG is good evidence against seizures, and the MRI is very good evidence against almost everything else life-threatening. 3) Consider that he may have some form of conversion disorder or similar problem that often does not fit neatly into the different boxes, and for which the best treatment more often is awareness and support. These can appear to any reasonable onlooker like the manifestations of something extremely dangerous, and commonly cause sufferers and loved ones a huge amount of distress, despite not being dangerous. Sometimes they get better with treatment that addresses the underlying anxiety/mood problem, but failing that simply being able to recognize them for what they are can help to make them less distressing (sort of how calming techniques are used for sleep paralysis).",

Crib, my bed, bath before, no bath, bottle, a good fart, it doesn't matter. The other 20% are just shenanigans but all in all, we eventually fall asleep. \n\nI accepted that this was life. Until tonight. She had a bandaid that I forgot to take off before her bath. I thought, \"you know what, lemme hook lil mama up and put some bath oil in the water to help soften up that sticky icky.\" So I grabbed the lavender oil because mama and daddy used to give each other a massage every night until we welcomed our lovely gremlin who serenades us with the song of our trusty beagle and her sister the husky mix at the top of her lungs. Anywho, life is good, yay bath time and playing with the water, the glory of modern plumbing. \n\nPajamas and the rest of her usual night time routine. Wide awake when I put her down and then.... she just peacefully fell asleep??? Like from eyes like two blue dinner plates to wake me when the neighbor's chicken starts tweeking tomorrow. \n\nThis has never happened. No fuss, no tears, no trying to make a great escape, no playing with her socks or hair, no howling at the moon, nothing.  Just..... sleep.......\n\nAll there was was the smell of lavender. \n\nAm I dreaming? Have I unlocked a new world in parenthood? Will it work again? I don't know. I can only hope. But something I do know is that I'm immediately going to buy baby lavender bath oil in bulk. If not for her, than for me because sweet baby Jesus, I'm tired. Good night!",

No, sniffing lavender oil will not cure me. Having my spine ~~permanently damaged~~ ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù by a chiropractor will not make my brain chemicals suddenly start producing pure happiness. Taking boatloads of vitamins can certainly make me very sick, but it will not cure my depression. \n\n3. Anything that‚Äôs a considerable financial expense. Telling people to travel more, join a gym, start spending more money on groceries or clothes, take a class, etc. is failing to take notice that many people have mental illness at least partially due to the stress of being impoverished, and they literally *can‚Äôt* buy only fresh fruits and vegetables, for example. In the really struggling parts of my city, you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find a legitimate full-service grocery store, and many people can‚Äôt expend the gas or tickets to drive to a store half an hour away. Yes, their existence is that financially precarious.

    "body": "I‚Äôm a witch. Shocker, I know, based on my username. Probably just saying that to you conjures up some pretty vivid images - either of a woman in a pointed hat throwing ingredients into a cauldron, or a goth teenager writing angrily into a journal covered in pentagrams. I'm not either of those things, but that's neither here nor there. \n\nA lot of people don‚Äôt seem to understand that the world of the supernatural isn‚Äôt all candles, cemeteries, and demons. Sometimes, it‚Äôs banging a pot and pan together to get the ornery old ghost that lives in your kitchen to stop opening all the cupboards, for the love of god. Or throwing your Tarot deck across the room for reminding you for the fourth time that you should be applying for jobs when you were asking about something completely unrelated - and then immediately apologizing to it because god only knows my Tarot deck can be catty and cruel when it wants to be.\n\nBut anyways, being a witch means I have a whole multitude of supernatural stories under my belt, ones that range from your typical ‚Äúthis is horrifying and I might shit my pants‚Äù right over to ‚Äúridiculous, hilarious, and kind of pathetic‚Äù. I have a lot of these stories for a few reasons - the first being that people tend to bring their supernatural problems to you, when they know you‚Äôre practicing. I‚Äôve busted way too many ghosts for my liking (and by busted, I mean asked nicely to leave. Funny how many people never really try talking to their spooks and spectres).\n\nThe more prevalent reason that I‚Äôm constantly surrounded by supernatural goings-on, however, is that when you declare your intent to practice magic to the world, the world listens. Raptly. A practicing witch is a light in the middle of the dead of night - a homing beacon for everything that‚Äôs used to operating in the shadows. That‚Äôs not to say that everything in the shadows is bad - sometimes the worst monsters are the ones that stay visible and thrive under attention. But, I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. \n\nI nanny part-time in tandem with freelancing graphic design work. When it comes to watching their kids, parents are much more willing to hire a woman in her late twenties than a fresh-faced teenager. Works out well for me, as I get to charge a little higher for that reason - and because, let‚Äôs face it, I‚Äôm good at what I do and in high demand because of it. The parents love that I keep their house clean, their kids clean, and stick to their schedules for bedtime. The kids love that I smell like lavender and peppermint and always show up with homemade cookies in my bag.\n\nParents and kids alike also love my ‚ÄúMonster Spray‚Äù. I keep a bottle of it in my nannying bag, tucked safely next to a package of wet-wipes. Water, salt, lavender oil, peppermint oil, clove oil - and a few other ingredients I‚Äôll keep secret. That‚Äôs all that‚Äôs in there. Seems like nothing to most adults - a room freshener, if it‚Äôs anything at all - but to a scared kid, it‚Äôs so much more than that. Most kids imagine monsters in their closets and under their beds. It‚Äôs just a normal part of childhood. We‚Äôve all been there, as children - that cold, trickling dread crawling down our spines, our hearts jackhammering in our ribcages as we stared down the slightly cracked-open door of the closet. We knew in our hearts that something in there was going to come out and eat us alive, and the worst part of it all was the feeling helplessness that creeped over us, leaving us paralyzed and still and afraid under our covers.\n\nMonster Spray, at its core, gives kids their power back. I put the Monster Spray into the hands of a terrified child and explain how much monsters hate the spray, how it causes them pain and makes them cower back to the creepy crawly depths they came from, and you can see the tiniest hint of bravery sparking itself alive in their eyes. They clutch the bottle with tiny hands and spray the everliving hell out of their closet, sometimes soaking their hanging clothes (hey, clothes dry). They‚Äôre then lulled back to a peaceful sleep by my soft singing voice, the smell of lavender and peppermint, and the bottle of Monster Spray that now officially takes up permanent residence on their nightstand table.\n\nA lot of children have been given their very own bottle of Monster Spray. One little girl I babysat for a few months sticks out in my mind, in particular. Let‚Äôs call her Anna. Anna was terrified of the big, wooden armoire in the corner of her room - one that used to be her grandmothers. Anna would tie her jumprope around the handles, only to have it unwound by the morning (which she of course, swore up and down that she didn‚Äôt do). Her parents were mostly unbothered by her tall tales, of course - they were mostly concerned with getting her a good night‚Äôs rest.\n\nIt was my third night babysitting when I had to bring out the Monster Spray. Anna had been put to bed and I was flipping idly through television channels. I had just settled on an episode of Chopped when I felt a cold chill ripple down my spine. A fraction of a second later, Anna screamed.\n\nIt‚Äôs not exactly the kind of things one wants to hear while babysitting another person‚Äôs child. In a panic, I ran up the stairs and turned the light on to find Anna sobbing and trying to climb up her headboard, as if to create more distance between herself and the armoire. It took a few moments to calm her down, but soon enough she let me hug her and sing to her. She eventually explained that she had gone to sleep, but woke up again when she started to hear scratching and banging from the armoire. It was followed by a sound like someone was turning a pool vacuum on and off - and then, she says, it felt like something was licking at her toes. \n\nI of course eyed the armoire as she told her story, studying it intently. I didn‚Äôt blame Anna - the old, wooden, heavy thing must have been from the gothic era - or at least was inspired by it. Creepy enough on its own, but combine it with those noises and the throat-tightening, hair-raising feeling I got when I looked at it for too long and I knew in my gut something was Up with a capital \"U\".\n\nI gently told Anna to go down to my bag and fetch the Monster Spray. As she was gone, I went to the window and cracked it open, and then removed the loosely hanging jumprope from the handles of the armoire. I met Anna in the hallway, where she placed the Spray into my waiting hands. I then told her to go have another cookie from my bag as she waits for me downstairs. Being a child, that was of course a no-brainer for her.\n\nWhen I was sure she was safely downstairs, I closed the bedroom door and turned off the lights. I sat on the floor, my back against the front of the armoire, and waited in the darkness. Sure enough, I felt a few light thumps at my back, followed by the sound of scratching and a wet sucking noise. I clenched my jaw tightly before speaking.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not welcome here. You‚Äôre scaring a little girl. You leave, or I make you leave. Are we clear?‚Äù\n\nThere was a beat of silence, during which my gaze found the gentle moon sitting just outside the window, its light streaming softly over the bedroom. It was a surprisingly peaceful moment, and for a fraction of a second I hoped that would be enough. \n\nA sudden jolt of pain broke my reverie as the armoire door slammed into my back and head twice. I pressed my body weight back firmly as a high-pitched, ear-piercing whine broke through the relative silence of Anna‚Äôs room. The whine reminded me of the feedback from a broken microphone, and I could feel a trickle of blood making its way out of my ear. And then, through the crack in the door that I couldn‚Äôt keep closed with my body weight, something reached out and grabbed my forearm.\n\nThe sensation of cold and heat was the first thing I noticed - slimy wetness sliding across my skin even as it bubbled under the touch of something as hot as a stove element, maybe hotter. I hissed through my teeth and jerked my arm away, pulling wet chunks of flesh from the creature as I did. \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough,‚Äù I grunted, clenching my jaw so hard I thought my teeth might break. I grabbed the Monster Spray as I swooped around, shut my eyes tight, opened the armoire door, and gave that thing the dousing of its life.\n\nI was immediately aware of the smell - it was something overpowering, toxic and dead, like the smell of burnt and melted plastic being poured over sun-baked roadkill. I could hear a hissing and popping and bubbling, and the creature‚Äôs shrieking reached a frantic din. Something bowled me over in its haste to leave the armoire, and I opened my eyes in time to see something mottled and dark and covered in smoking, scaled skin illuminated in the moonlight as it crawled out the window.\n\nAnna slept beside me  on the couch until her parents arrived home. Frankly, I felt better that way, myself. I told her that I had made the monster leave, and that as long as she had her Monster Spray, no monster would ever come back. She fell asleep curled around the bottle, and when her parents arrived home they were so charmed by the story of the Monster Spray that they didn‚Äôt even mind that Anna wasn‚Äôt in bed. They did make sure I put some polysporin on the burn on my forearm, though. I‚Äôm so clumsy with the tea kettle, I had explained with a laugh.\n\nParents always find Monster Spray to be a charming ‚Äúparenting technique‚Äù, like something clever you‚Äôd find on Pinterest. They always remark, often a few weeks later, how much more confident and at ease their child seems with that bottle beside their bed. How bedtimes always used to be a problem, but now their kid jumps into bed eagerly. How I helped make the monsters disappear; this is always said with a wink and an elbow nudge, because of course their child is just being silly or over-imaginative.\n\nWhat I never tell those parents is that in my experience, children who need the Monster Spray always have an extremely good reason. That spray isn‚Äôt made with that concoction of oils simply because it smells good. Everything in Monster Spray is there for purification purposes - water cleansed with crystals, salt, the specific oils, everything has a purpose. That sole, singular purpose is to keep any nasties away that might be particularly attracted to the shiny, beautiful newness of a child.\n\nSee, children have an energy and a presence that is unlike most dull, mundane things - they‚Äôre closer to being outside of our world than in it, and because of that, they‚Äôre beacons, too. They still carry a trace, a lingering whiff, of the Past World, and that‚Äôs a very tantalizing thing to most supernatural creatures. \n\nBut I smile and nod at the parents, pretending to be in on some kind of ruse to these over-confident people who, once-upon-a-time, also had spirits and demons trailing after them like toilet paper on a shoe. And then I go home and make another batch of Monster Spray.",

    "body": "I have this friend, we can call her Elly for the sake of this. Me and her have been friends for about two years now. In the beginning of our friendship, I noticed nothing wrong. As we got closer, though, the things she would say made less and less sense. Outlandish things, that had no chance of being true. She would swear they were true and I didn‚Äôt really have the proof. \n\nI also noticed she had this desperate need for attention. Any time the attention wasn‚Äôt on her she would find a way to bring it back to herself. You got 5 hours of sleep? Well, she got four. Your allergies are bad? Hers are worse. You get the point. One time, I went to the doctor. I‚Äôm a hard stick so they couldn‚Äôt draw blood and had to refer me elsewhere. Of course, like every teenager, I texted a group chat about it. She immediately started talking about how hard it was to draw her blood. \n\nShe also tried constantly to prove what a good social reach she had. Anyone you mentioned, she said she knew. (even if she didn‚Äôt) \n\nThis has gone on for years, finally I got tired of it. I couldn‚Äôt trust a thing she would say and everything felt like a competition. It was pathetic how she scrambled for any ounce of attention. \n\nOne time, she was going on and on about how rich her grandparents were. How they have already given her a luxury car, even before she could drive. (Which she conveniently cannot take to school, of course). She described the mansion they had to all my friends. \n\nSo what did I do? \n\nI tracked down her mom‚Äôs facebook, went through her friend‚Äôs list, and found her grandparents‚Äô names. Through that, I found out about where they lived. I tracked down their exact address using WhitePages and Zillow. I found that the square footage/worth of their house was middle class at best. About the size of mine. No signs of the obscure ‚Äúmafia‚Äù (her words not mine)type wealth. \n\nShe also said she‚Äôs gotten high before. The way she described it was extremely weird. She said she took this medicine for anxiety, and that it got her high. I tracked down the exact medication she was speaking of. There was no way it got her high.

I just made my story up and Korn was never near here for a concert!

I‚Äôm saddened when I read posts that express the powerlessness and frustration because it also reminds me that in so many ways we are so so so so routinely invalidated (and that‚Äôs putty it kindly) but there is NO WHERE for the anger to go. As a result I see my able bodied friends have their healthy entitlement & a healthy confidence intact, as well as a sense of fight. \nCan I also add - is anyone else so f‚Äôing tired of having concrete solutions thrown at non-concrete & complex problems?\n‚ÄúJust sue!‚Äù ‚ÄúGet on disability!‚Äù I want to scream. The saddest part is that most of us just don‚Äôt have the energy. Have they seen the disability form? In Australia it‚Äôs a bare minimum of 128 pages. Every single diagnosis has a number of formal measures (like a complex spine one) that I for one know my neurosurgeon would not touch with a ten foot pole.\nIt‚Äôs not a projection that the groan from GPs is real. They hate paperwork - I don‚Äôt want to be bringing it in - but what choice do I have?\nEvery single moment self esteem, hope, confidence, trust, belief etc is stripped away to result in helplessness, expecting little to nothing, eventually falling silent (because their last remark tells me everything - it‚Äôs futile and I‚Äôm not going to try and convince a moron to be able to see or care). \nIf I rant further, If I hear another able bodied person compare their pain or xyz to mine e.g at Christmas I said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt drink. If interacts with my meds.‚Äù A friend said, ‚Äúoh, I knoooow what you mean (detailed drinking with penecillin and vomiting).‚Äù I‚Äôm seething inside thinking ‚Äúno, f face. Not vomiting. Respiratory depression. As in I could die. Vomiting is a given with pain on a good day.‚Äù\nI also note I was a Dr before all this and never ever once would I imagine talking to patients the way we‚Äôve been talked at / through (because it‚Äôs as if we have no feelings and as if choice is a luxury or privilege and we should be grateful for shitty & unhelpful advice).  this. Their realities are real & true. The medical model is f‚Äôed up - there has never been nor never will be any evidence to show that gaslighting is an effective method. \n\nI‚Äôm sharing because my intention isn‚Äôt to make anyone feel better. All I can say is that in this group here I‚Äôve finally found mirroring of my reality. That‚Äôs everything. \n\nIt‚Äôs that no one not in our bodies can understand the anger gone inward (which moves into giving in, giving up, fawning or playing grateful for shit ‚Äúadvice‚Äù which Drs likely chalk up as ‚Äúpatient‚Äôs noncompliance with intervention.‚Äù To me it‚Äôs morally egregious. It‚Äôs corrupt - at best - to victim blame - and its imperialism and colonisation at worst. \n\nThis is a huge leap but I come from a school (psychiatry) where once there was a diagnosis called ‚Äúabsconding disorder‚Äù which was a diagnosis given to slaves who tried to escape. We don‚Äôt call it ‚Äútorture & oppression‚Äù. We didn‚Äôt call it ‚Äúremoval of dignity & humiliation.‚Äù If we did, absconding would be considered an incredibly healthy act.\n\nIt isn‚Äôt the same and I truly welcome correction because I am not literally equating the experience of chronic misery & chronic pain to slavery. Metaphorically I‚Äôm saying that it chains us as dependent upon systems in power that continually abuse that power, tell us our reality is our fault. My analyst often reminds me that it is systemic discrimination - often I feel like Oliver Twist or a Jew begging the Nazi, ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm telling the truth.‚Äù \n\nDon‚Äôt get me started on being treated like a stereotype (junkie) collecting my opioids (the bare bare bare minimum) once every 3 weeks (that‚Äôs just one of many prescriptions). Every time I say ‚Äúno, I don‚Äôt misuse. Yes, they‚Äôre due today.‚Äù The pharmacist counts aloud the amount per day from last pickup to today‚Äôs date and then says ‚Äúyou have one extra.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, I took it this morning in order to get here for lunch time because without it I cannot drive 5 minutes to get here.‚Äù \n\nWith regard to weight or BMI, yes, it‚Äôs not anyplace different if you‚Äôre of a quote unquote ‚Äúhealthy weight‚Äù [sic] - let‚Äôs cast aside how BMI is a TERRIBLE method of projecting someone‚Äôs health outcomes based on weight & height. Any athlete, especially those professional ones (e.g Olmpics) are mostly ‚Äúmorbidly obese‚Äù [again, not my words]. \n\nWhat I get day in day out? ‚ÄúBut you look fine!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, I wouldn‚Äôt have known because you look active.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre slim!‚Äù \nMy neurosurgeon‚Äôs nurse thought it especially helpful after I was left harmed after the first surgery & left for dead for 14 months to remind me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre young, you‚Äôre smart - you‚Äôll get your mojo back.‚Äù How does me being (relatively) young (I‚Äôm 41), smart and/or ‚Äúslim‚Äù unbreak my spine? Um-seize my muscles? Stop migraines? Make me able to walk again? \n\nA lovely colleague said ‚Äúthe sad part is that if you were in a wheelchair you‚Äôd likely get treated as if what you are saying is real.‚Äù In its entirety the idea of treatment aimed at changing our outsides (rather than the internal pain) speaks volumes about what we value in this world and is a sad indictment of the world we find ourselves in.   \n\nRANT AWAY, FRIENDS!",

        "body": "The last part of this post made me giggle but I‚Äôm pretty sure that it‚Äôs so relatable to pretty much everyone here üòÖ Pain management is extremely relative to each patient so there will never be a solution that fits everyone. It also depends on underlying health conditions that could be impacted by certain AMA options and/or certain herbal/holistic options. BMI can also contribute to certain types of pain for some people but not others. I‚Äôll never understand how any ‚Äúpain specialist‚Äù can be so convinced that only one certain treatment philosophy applies to every chronic pain patient on the planet bc that has never been true and never will be. Opioids were created for a damn reason: TO TREAT PAIN!! Advil and tylenol were not originally created to treat pain, but opioids were and they DO work so there‚Äôs no shame in knowing that they are the best solution for your specific case. If the FDA/CDC never existed, chronic pain would be treated much more effectively in America. Just like with everything else they touch, the US government and other worldly powers have ruined pain management (and medicine in general) simply by taking control of it. They want us to be as disabled as possible so that we must rely on them for survival and their greatest fear is individual independence bc that causes them to lose some control of us. The biggest reason so many doctors push the lifestyle changes and holistic route is bc it‚Äôs the path with the least liability for them since you can‚Äôt overdose on those things and they tend to be very vague when describing how to use those options for your specific case so that you can‚Äôt sue them if it harms you in any way. The modern healthcare system puts liability before everything else, including patient wellbeing.",

    "body": "Some of you might remember me. I was one of the moderators here for half a decade or so until my life got busy enough that it became difficult to keep up.\n\nI have a small fragrance line myself and I occasionally make fragrances for other brands. Occasionally websites like Fragrantica and Now Smell this will write articles about my fragrances. I'm by no means a famous perfumer, but. I've worked enough as a perfumer to have insight into how fragrances are made.\n\nThe average person doesn't really think about what's actually in their fragrances any more than the average person really considers what flavors blend together to make up the taste of cola. (As a side note, you can make a passable cola flavor out of orange, lime cinnamon, lemon, nutmeg and coriander). When people do start thinking about it, they inevitably come across fragrance notes.\n\nFragrance notes are both incredibly useful and completely misleading because NOTES ARE NOT INGREDIENTS! Notes are the impressions that the fragrance creator thinks a lay person might get from smelling the fragrance. They aren't necessarily the ingredients used in the fragrance, and also...this is another important bit...they're not necessarily even what the perfumer was attempting to make the fragrance smell like.\n\nThere's a fundamental misconception on the part of most consumers. Most consumers think that fragrances are made largely from familiar materials. Orange, lemon, jasmine, rose, birch leaves, lily of the valley, etc. Ok, maybe most people realize that most fragrances contain synthetic materials, but there's quite often an implicit assumption that the synthetics are a synthetic version of a natural material...in other words, that the synthetic is an attempt to recreate a smell that is found in nature and that all (or at least most) of the smells in a modern fragrance CAN be reproduced with naturals. I suppose that if you asked someone \"do you think that all synthetics are an attempt to recreate a natural smell?\" they would think about it and quickly come to the conclusion that this doesn't really make sense, but most people haven't actually stopped and thought about it. I see evidence of this assumption all over the place online:\n\n\"I'm looking for all natural version of [fragrance X]\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a less synthetic version of Sauvage\"\n\n\"Can someone tell me which essential oils I can mix together to make an aquatic smell like cool water.\"\n\nIt's really only pretty recently that there's been any real visibility (to the general public) into what materials go into a commercial fragrance so this is an understandable point of view.\n\nIt's very, very wrong though.\n\nWe need to take a giant step back clarify some things.\n\nNatural oils (essential oils/absolute oils/SCO2 extracts/etc) are typically made up of dozens or hundreds of different materials. They're like miniature perfumes in and of themselves with top notes, heart notes and base notes. They're complex and beautiful, but they can only be manipulated in a limited way. They're like photographs.\n\nSpecialty bases are typically made up of dozens of individual ingredients, some natural, some man made, some that exist in nature, some that didn't exist until they were created in a lab in the 60's. Basically, the sky's the limit. You generally don't know exactly what's in them, but they're produced by suppliers that you can be pretty sure will still be making them in 20 years. Sometimes, they're direct attempts to reproduce (or improve upon) a natural smell, for reasons of cost, safety or performance. Sometimes, they're just a novel smell, like Givaudan's aquatic smelling Ultrazur base. These are like computer generated images.\n\nIsolates are ingredients made of a single type of molecule. They can be naturally derived or lab made. They can exist in nature or not. They have names like linalool, coumarin, limonene, ambroxide, methyl dihydrojasmonate and you can describe them typically find the chemical formula for them. A lot of them have trade names that are shorter and refer to one company's version. E.g. Hedione is a trade name for methyl dihydrojasmonate. Quite often isolates can also be found in natural oils.  Natural lavender oil is typically ~42% linalyl actate and ~40% linalool. When composing fragrances, I'll use linalool and linalyl acetate as isolates as well. Sometimes I'll use it them to \"tune\" other ingredients that already contain them, but not in the quantities I want (like lavender). Sometimes I'll use them to add a sweet, floral character to completely unrelated materials. If natural oils are like photographs and bases are like CGI, isolates are like paints. You have the most control, but it takes the most skill to turn them into something beautiful and complex.\n\n\"Aromachemical\" is a catch all term used to describe these fragrant materials, though it typically connotes materials that are either isolates or bases.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, let's take a look at how commercial fragrances are created.  The easiest way to do that is to take a look at a formula:\n\nCologne accord:\n\nThis is an example formula for a \"cologne\" accord that was composed by Givaudan. It's by no means a finished fragrance, but most everyone would recognize the smell. It's a fresh, slightly sweet, slightly bitter, slightly green smell that often finds its way into men's fresh fragrances in one way or another (though that's not to say that this exact formula does).\n\n* Florhydral - 10\n* Exaltolide Total - 10\n* Ultrazur - 15\n* Peonile - 60\n* Petitgrain oil -70\n* Ethylene Brassylate - 90\n* Aurantiol Pure - 100\n* Geranyl Acetate - 120\n* Linalyl Acetate - 220\n* Dihydro Myrcenol - 305\n\nTotal: 1000\n\nLets take a look at these ingredients one by one:\n\n**Florhydral** is the trade name for an isolate. It is a floralizer that can add a sort of fresh, green, floral note to fragrances. It is not found in nature\n\n**Exaltolide** is another single molecule, a white musk. It's very delicately animalic, with the characteristic smell of a white musk. It's been used as a reference white musk because it's so typical of the \"white musk\" family.\n\n**Ultrazur** is a specialty base from Givaudan. It's marine smelling, more oceanic than the Calone 1951 found in Cool Water. By itself, in concentration, it reminds me very much of fabric softener.\n\n**Peonile** is another \"not found in nature\" molecule. It has a sort of rosy, sort of geraniumlike, sort of peonylikee sort of grapefruitlike oder and acts as a volumizer and fixative. Odor descriptions that call to mind an assortment of known materials are fairly common, but it‚Äôs important to note that they don‚Äôt mean that it smells like x+y+z. It just means that they have facets that are reminiscent of these materials in some way.\n\n**Petitgrain oil** is a natural oil made from the greenery of a citrus tree. Usually from orange trees, but varieties from mandarin, lemon and all sorts of other citrus are also available.\n\n**Ethylene brassylate** is a sweet, floral, white musk that can smell a touch old fashioned to some people by itself, or in really high concentrations. It‚Äôs still a fairly clean musk, however. Yet another single molecule.\n\n**Aurantiol** is a very, very commonly used material in fragrances, particularly men‚Äôs fragrances. It‚Äôs a single molecule (more or less). Aurantiol is a Schiff Base, which is a class of materials that you get when you combine an aldehyde and an amine and they react with each other. Most amines don‚Äôt smell very good, but one of them, something called methyl anthranilate, does. It‚Äôs found in white florals, particularly neroli, as well as grapes. Artificial grape flavor is basically methyl anthranilate. Hydroxyitronellal is an aldehyde that is often said to smell as close as any single material does to Lily of the Valley. When they‚Äôre mixed together and heated, you get water and a very thick,  highlighter yellow colored schiff base that smells like a more mild version of methyl anthranilate. It‚Äôs sweet, long lasting and reminiscent of orange blossom/neroli and grape.\n\n**Geranyl acetate** is the acetate version of geraniol. It‚Äôs a single molecule that is literally found in hundreds of natural oils. Everything from oregano and thyme to ylang ylang, rose, geranium and neroli, to fir needle and frankincense. It‚Äôs everywhere (much like linalool and linalyl actetate). It‚Äôs sweet, fruity-floral, and vaguely green smelling. It also has a smell that I think of as the ‚Äúacetate smell,‚Äù which can make it smell ‚Äúchemically‚Äù to some people in isolation, even though it‚Äôs found everywhere in nature.\n\n**Linalyl acetate** is another material like geranyl acetate that‚Äôs found all over the place in nature. Natural lavender oil is ~42% linalyl acetate. It‚Äôs also found in most of the natural oils I mentioned for geranyl actetate. The description for it is also very similar to geranyl acetate, but it‚Äôs more lavendery and less rosy. I really like this material and use it when I was to add an ethereal fruity/floral sweetness to a composition \n\n**Dihydromyrcenol** is aggressively fresh, cold and almost harsh. It‚Äôs somewhat reminiscent of citrus and lavender. Mostly, though, it smells like laundry detergent. It was used to scent laundry detergent for years before it made it into fine fragrance. At first it was used in tiny doses, but by the 1980‚Äôs is was being used much more prominently. Something like 10% of the formula of Drakkar Noir was dihydromyrcenol. It‚Äôs found in trace amounts in nature, but nothing natural really smells prominently of it.\n\nSo now that i‚Äôve explained all the materials, let‚Äôs take a look at the formula. Here are some observations:\n\nNatural oils from recognizable sources only make up 7% of the accord. There are other materials that are found in nature, but they‚Äôre all isolates, one alien smelling molecule refined from a more familiar smelling material.\nMore than half of the formula is made from 2 molecules. More than 90% Is made from 8.\nThe amounts of materials used can vary wildly. Material strength is in no way consistent.\n\nThe perfumer who composed this formula painted the majority of the formula in broad strokes from single molecule aromachemicals and then filled in depth and details with natural petitgrain oil, and tiny amounts of a specialty base (ultrazur) and a powerful aldehyde (florhydral). \n\nI didn‚Äôt compose this, and I can‚Äôt speak for the perfumer who did, but I can imagine how it might have been composed. I‚Äôll walk you through my imagining of the perfumer‚Äôs process:\n\nI imagine the accord was inspired by the petitgrain, but the perfumer wanted something fresher and more stylized and abstract, in the same way a graphic designer might prefer a stylized logo to a photo.  Dihydromyrcenol is fresh and powerful, but also cold and harsh and almost bitter. It‚Äôs a good compliment to petitgrain, but right off the bat, I know it‚Äôs not going to be suitable by itself unless i‚Äôm trying to just modify the smell of petitgrain a little bit by adding a teeny tiny bit dihydromyrcenol. It needs some cushion, something to cut the harshness. Geranyl acetate and linalyl acetate add a niche cushioning effect, can be used liberally and are both found in petitgrain, so they‚Äôll go well with it. By itself, that composition is still cold and bitter. It needs a bit more warmth, but not a candylike warmth. Something keeping in like with the petitgrain. Aurantiol is the obvious choice. The scent of orange tree leaves go well with the scent of the orange blossoms that nestle amongst them. In keeping with the ‚Äúmore abstract‚Äù theme though, we don‚Äôt want to just dump neroli or orange blossom absolute into this. Too much complexity can leave a composition smelling muddled, and we want the bitter, fresh, green petitgrain to be the star of the show here, not the neroli. Plus, neroli is quite expensive and not as long lasting as aurantiol. We add the aurantiol for warmth. The peonile for volume and some white musks for depth. It‚Äôs pretty common to use multiple musks in a fragrance because many people are anosmic to some musks, so you want to make sure they‚Äôre able to smell at least one of them.\n\nThen as finishing touches, we add a hint of Ultrazur, which adds a bit of modern sophistication and florhydral, which in tiny amounts adds a bit of a dewy, natural, green smell to the composition.\n\nThis composition isn‚Äôt about taking familiar smells and mixing them together like some sort of fruit salad with hunks of this and hunks of that. It‚Äôs about taking an idea and enhancing aspects of it, rebalancing it until it fits the vision. It‚Äôs more like painting than making a collage. It‚Äôs not necessarily as detailed or accurate, but it‚Äôs not supposed to be. Degas wasn‚Äôt trying to create photorealistic ballerinas. Van Gogh wasn‚Äôt trying to accurately render the night sky. They were trying to evoke an impression. Perfumers are the same way.\n\nIf that fragrance doesn‚Äôt smell like realistic rose/jasmine/cedar/etc, chances are, it wasn‚Äôt intended to. The perfumer wasn‚Äôt trying to make a realistic jasmine and failing, the perfumer was trying to make an entirely new smell that just has aspects that are jasminelike.\n\nBreaking it apart into notes is actually counterproductive in a lot of ways.\n\n...but that‚Äôs a subject for another post.",

But what does make this hobby interesting is to test my perception of a fragrance, to see if what i smell lines up with the notes and compare it to what others pick up from the same scent. This article does clear up a few annoyances i have with people of any perfume community, especially when they claim that their favorite perfume has been reformulated or watered down this year because they own one from 20 years ago, thanks to the assumption that their perfumes have enough natural ingredients for that to happen. No! the notes arent a representation of the actual ingredients used! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, the recent re-bottling of Guerlain's songes du bois de ete into bois mysteriux as well as encens mythiques (from the exclusive line to the middle eastern line) triggered some people into declaring that it has been watered down without any mention of how they compared it with the one in the luxury exclusive bottle  even though guerlain and the formula number remains identical. Just. Because. Of. A. Bottle. Change.  Many others who actually own the older luxury exclusive bottles did a side-by-side comparison with the new one says that they are identical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd we dont need to mention about the um, inconsistencies with different batches of aventus here, do we?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess this article and that incident does goes to show how much perception plays a role in enjoying and appreciating fragrance.

I was going to finally have a chance to bathe for the 1st time since Friday but my son who turns 3 in a week threw a fit and I had to get out and drain it before I could even get my hair wet. My husband couldn't handle it. I just want to feel human again.\n\nOur son has been extra difficult lately and we haven't had a break since November. All he wants is me (mom) and if he can't have me he throws such a huge tantrum that I essential can't bathe or even get enough time to pee.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I hate waking up each morning. Over the last couple months I feel like I am just trying to make it through each day and every breath takes effort. I feel so flat and hollow. I miss me.\n\nSorry for the rant. I just want to want to be alive again. My husband and I are just walking zombies now. \n\nUpdate: \n\nI want to clarify that my husband is typically a really good partner but is dealing with a spinal injury right now and has nerve pain and weakness in all of his limbs. We have been working with a specialist for non surgical treatment options but it is looking like he will need surgery. This is why my husband hasn't been able to help as much recently. \n\nI am glad to report that I just got out of a shower followed by an hour long bath with my Epsom salts and lavender oil. \n\nKiddo is in a much better mood today and my husband is having a lower pain day so they are at the park. \n\nWhen they get back I am going to sent my husband up for a shower and some him time while we wait for a pizza to arrive and we will be eating on paper plates.\n\nI am feeling a bit better today. The stress has been rough lately and I really appreciate everyone's support. \n\nI have been reading every comment and though I can't respond to each one I want to thank you for your empathy. I was feeling like a failure and a horrible mother last night and was in a bit of a crisis. \n\nYou all have helped me feel seen and heard and I am so grateful.",

Then one day I said im over it. I WILL take care of myself. I DESERVE basic human needs! I WILL make it happen.\n\nSo usually, ill have husband take todder and baby into a different place, like the park or the backyard or playing one-on-one with them in a separate room while i lock myself in the bathroom.\n\nIf for some reason that doesn't work (usually it's my husband not wanting to üôÑ) then I shower with my kid (husband watches baby). I rinse off, shave and then I plug the drain and kiddo gets to play in the \"shower-bath\" as I call it while I do a nice scrub and deep conditioning. Sometimes with conditioner in my hair, I'll sit and play with bathtoys. Then I usually get out first while kiddo plays in the bath while i do my face oil and lotions.\n\nOther tips to feel human again: \n\n-wireless dry electric razor (the kind that doesnt cut skin) for random middle of the day leg shaving on the couch when time allows.\n\n-I also bought foot and back massage devices that plug into the wall while I sit on the couch.\n\n-heatless curl devices to make hair look less terrible but are easy to do in 15 mins and forget. I like the single long tube cushiony one.\n\n-putting on makeup involves pretending I actually opened the cosmetic while I swipe it on toddlers face.\n\n-I bought gold stud shiny earrings to sleep in. Gold doesn't irritate my skin but also they make studs with flat backs so they don't poke your neck sleeping so you can put them in and forget them. This way I've got a little sparkle on me to feel less tired looking.\n\nEdit: you mentioned not being able to have him sleep without you and not being able to leave the bed. My toddler is the same and what helped me feel like I could have my own space was getting toddler a camping cot hugged up next to the bed. I hyped the living shit out of it about how big they were and how special their bed was. I let toddler hold me all awkward while I hung half off the bed for the first couple nights. But now she sleeps in it and if she crawls back into bed I snuggle her like a hug and then pick her up and set her back in it.",

Every one has a different situation so I won‚Äôt go too deep into this.  \n\n\nEdit: I saw the part where you said your husband was suffering spinal issues. That is a lot of stress and pressure placed on you. Do you find yourself having to care for him as well?\n\nIdk if yours still takes naps. If so for me I made a small gym at home for lifting. i used to play catch up/reset on his naps, now i use that hour in half to workout eat something, snd shower. This is my me time. If he doesn‚Äôt nap well fine i still work out but see next part\n\nIv decided there will be messes, so i reset as we go throughout the day\n\nI give him a giant tub of dry rice, dry beans, toys such his cars and beach things etc. I put him in this tub in front of me and he plays while I do things I need to do. I‚Äôm also not afraid to turn on the tv. That being said he is time limited and the shows he is allowed to watch are Danny go, and color blocks. All shows that have helped him say his colors, dance, and learn. \n\nCleaning for me iv decided unless it‚Äôs imperative and we can‚Äôt do it together then it can be done later. \n\nOne blessing for me is I got him a toy vacuum that he loved and now wants to always use the big vacume. So I make a pot of coffee give him the vacume, sit near the plug so he can‚Äôt touch it and cheer him on. I also got him a small hand vac that he will use to clean up.\n\nThe biggest result, I get to drink coffee while he ¬´¬†cleans¬†¬ª and giggles, and when I vacume I have my own lil cheer section who yells YAY GO DAD, with every swipe of the vacume.\n\nYes again my house can get messy but i have a healthy happy toddler again I have a HEALTHY AND HAPPY TODDLER. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs important. \n\nNow for tantrums if he has a melt down I try to gentle parent, but I‚Äôm not perfect and if I start to or feel like I‚Äôm going to get into a ¬´¬†fight¬†¬ª and I know I‚Äôm losing my cool and can‚Äôt handle it, I‚Äôll be honest I know his crib and room are a safe space for him. I have out him in there and walked out for up to 15 min to take a deep breath and regain my composer. He‚Äôs two he can‚Äôt regulate the same way we do but gosh dang does it feel personal sometimes lmao. This isn‚Äôt the norm but I find this reset helps both of us adjust ourselves.\n\nAnyway I know these days can be super tough and you get to the finish line and are too tired to do something. There are days the only bath iv gotten is the one I took with my toddler(so I was probly more dirty getting out than when I got in) but in general even if I‚Äôm tired I force myself to take a quick shower after he goes to bed. I know these might not be exactly helpful to you directly but I just wanted to give examples of how I found ways to make time for myself and my wife, while raising a toddler and still trying to feel human who isn‚Äôt locked in a tiny prison. \n\nHope this helps a lil bit\n\nEdit: I read further down and saw that you are also a caretaker as well and the . My heart goes out to you and your family.",

    "body": "So, this is by no means definitive. Likewise, some will disagree with me because Ashley isn't an intentional sepsis munchie (thank GOD). However, she still harms her own health to keep up her grift.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other day, when she showed us her detox ritual, it was incredible evident how she causes her own discomfort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.) The scam oil. In addition to a bunch of hoopla in its woo-woo plant extracts, it contains Lavender oil. While it smells amazing, and is generally safe on the skin, it's still an antiseptic. Why would that be safe to consume? In addition to this it contains tea-tree oil. Also a natural antiseptic. It's great for the skin (if you aren't prone to dryness!) but it is by no means meant to be consumed.\n\n2.) The sauna. Our beige hero claims to have every so serious POTS, but yet will bask in the suffocating heat of her infrared sauna for long periods of time. I couldn't do it (then again, I have never been a fan of the heat, so my intolerance is not universal). She gets IV fluids several times per week for her soooooper serious POTS, but yet guzzles water and electrolyte drinks to make up for the sweating in the sauna. So why the IV fluids too?\n\n3.) The sedatives. Benzos are probably fun. Opiates are probably fun too. But if they're going to be liberally consumed, they will cause tiredness and lethargy, which our poor widdle Lyme Princess attributes to her *real, very very real so incredibly real* Chronic Lyme. In addition to her liberal use of Valium, she is also on Olanzapine (or at least was for a while). Antipsychotics famously cause tiredness and lethargy (but they are still effective medications for many people). But rather than her medication, it's the Chronic Lyme.\n\n4.) The incessant pot use. I can actually speak from experience here, as I am now one week away from being five months sober. Smoking pot every day is super fun! I honestly miss it, but man, does it cause almost constant brain fog. It's generally harder to think and it makes you tired. But somehow she convinces herself, that once again it is the Chronic Lyme but the ‚ú®neurological symptoms‚ú®.\n\n5.) IV woo-woo water. Myers cocktails and \"NAD+ therapy\". Need I say more?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mention this because it is classic Munchausen's to make yourself sick in addition to using it for sympathy. I have no doubt that Ashley feels like shit given that this is how she lives her life. But, she does this for her sick princess lifestyle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe crazy thing though, is that Ashley already has a chronic condition. She has Chron's. It has put her in the hospital and thrown her life off of track before. I've known people who have Chron's. It's not an easy illness, so why does she feel the need to come up with silly things like coopting EDS and Chronic Lyme? Paul has shown us you can totally munch off of Chron's alone, so why doesn't Ash do that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: What are your favorite ways Ashley self sabotages? ",

They falsely claim that the bacteria are dying off and that it must mean that bacteria are there. \n\nThe \"Lyme literate\"/functional/integrative quacks who prey on women like Ashley call this a herx, which is a coopting of a real phenomenon called the Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction. \n\nIt is a gaslighting technique that quacks use when their victims feel worse.\n\nDr. Steven Novella discusses the [herxing belief](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/jarisch-herxheimer-and-lyme-disease/): \n\n>When patients diagnosed with chronic Lyme are treated, no matter what happens as a response to the treatment is considered by believers to be evidence in support of the diagnosis. If they get better, then that is evidence that the treatment is working. If they get worse, then that is evidence that the treatment is working and they are experiencing the JHR (or ‚Äúherxing‚Äù as the community calls it). If nothing happens, they just need more treatment. No matter what happens or doesn‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs chronic Lyme.\n\nWe frequently see victims of chronic Lyme quackery being told to celebrate the \"herx\".  There's definitely a lot of self-flagellation that occurs in the alternative universe of chronic Lyme. But it provides feelings of control to finally have what seems like an an answer to their problems.\n\nAnother gaslighting technique that quacks use is to prescribe impossible-to-follow diet and drug/supplement regimens. Then when the victim inevitably fails to follow the regimen, the victim is blamed for not sticking to the program. \n\nAlso, the quack can sell more fake and inexpensive testing to diagnose fake \"coinfections\" (e.g. fake bartonella or fake babesia) and other fake diagnoses (e.g. fake MCAS and fake mold). If someone isn't improving, they can blame the other fake diagnoses.\n\nTo redirect the blame, the Chronic Lyme Cult encourages its followers to develop a persecution complex and believe in conspiracy theories, falsely claiming that mainstream medicine and insurance companies are plotting to keep them from being healed of all these (fake) diagnoses.",

    "body": "DISCLAIMER:\n*I (43f) am not a medical professional. I don‚Äôt guarantee any of these self-realizations, tools, routines, notes, words of advice will work for everyone. I don‚Äôt claim my philosophy to be academically accurate. I have used what I have learned -or interpreted- from six years of psychotherapy (twice a week), three levels of DBT, my own reading, research on the endocannabinoid system, from the experiences of others and from observing MY patterns of emotion and behavior. Whatever seems to work consistently / dependably for me, I keep notes on. But what works for me or makes sense to me, may not, for you.*\n\nThank you for the gold‚ú®!! It makes a huge, positive difference to not see ads for a while. Sincerely grateful ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\n*Please don‚Äôt grade this like a book report.*\n\n*Please don‚Äôt criticize me, or this in any way. It‚Äôs extremely triggering.*\n\n*Apologies for incomplete sentences, formatting, spelling errors, grammar, etc, especially since I‚Äôve copy/pasted most of this text from my previous posts in r/cptsd and other similar subreddits.*\n\n\n#here are the guidelines that literally save my life on a regular basis. \n\nMy CPTSD is very acute, and needs to be monitored vigilantly. But, I‚Äôve had no suicidal attempts since 5/17/17, my last Semicolon day. And I‚Äôve found a lot of moments of genuine joy since then. \n\n\n##Keeping A strict routine. \n\nI mean, waking up, working, Netflix-ing, lazy time-ing around the same times of day or same days each week. Including eating the exact same thing the same day of the week. Exercising the same time and days each week. Eventually my metabolism and digestive system got really predictable. \n\nIt‚Äôs a HUGE feeling of relief and self-management that at least *this* part of my existence is steady and predictable. Controllable.\n\n\nI‚Äôve had to learn what kinds of meals and what size of meals work best for ME and sticking to it. \n\n\nAnd by ‚Äúworking for me‚Äù I *do\n not* mean foods that give me a sense of relief or comfort, because I don‚Äôt want to create (or continue) an unhealthy relationship with food. \n\n\nI have to stay conscious about where I am getting my oxytocin / serotonin / dopamine supply, so eating is extremely intentional. Things that take a long time for me to digest, like gluten, heavy casseroles, most dairy, it interrupts my serotonin production in my gut, causing a deficit that leads to suicidal ideation. (This took me *years* to figure out. I don‚Äôt have a gluten or dairy allergy, I have a sensitivity.)  \n\n\nIt‚Äôs effort not to give in to my guilt when someone offers me something I know is going to fuck me up (office birthday cake, potlucks, etc). But I have just gone thru too many cycles of wanting to slit my wrists because of Debbie‚Äôs birthday sheet cake at work two days prior that I‚Äôm actually kind of afraid of certain foods now. Literally poison that could kill me slowly. \n\n\nRecently I got braver about this when I‚Äôm out in restaurants. One of my symptoms of CPTSD is I don‚Äôt get hungry, really. I can go three whole days without actually feeling hungry and getting a craving for something. So instead of pressuring myself to eat lavish, celebratory meals when I have to go out for dinner with friends, I practice checking in with my body and mental state to see what kind of sustenance I *actually* need in the moment. For example, if I go to a steakhouse, And I see they have baked potatoes for sides, I‚Äôll ask for a single baked potato. Or if it‚Äôs a brunch spot, one single egg. I know by now what works best for my mind and body. Every time I‚Äôve tried to do the three-meals-a-day thing it has exacerbated my anxiety, my digestive issues and is a trigger for when my meals were weighed out for me, or I was forced to eat. Maybe someone will think I‚Äôm fussy, but I just can‚Äôt care because........\n\n*Link to notes on how I figured out my diet was affecting my serotonin production, leading to severe ideation:*\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDNextSteps/comments/jp1fg0/this_is_my_personal_guide_to_managing_my_cptsd/gbdgefx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3\n\n##I have stopped admonishing myself for having a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù attitude. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs that I do not have the capability to care about about certain things to a certain degree anymore, because it‚Äôs detrimental to my mental health. \n\nI have to be choosy about where I direct my attention. *Friend: Did you hear about all those protests downtown? Me: Yeah, I did. And it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not concerned, I just can‚Äôt care about that right now. I‚Äôm in survival mode.*\n\n\n\n##Dealing with Self-harm urges: \n\nIce water. In the throws of a panic attack, ice cold water to the face and hands redirects the brains attention. When we submerge our face and hands in ice-cold water (like in a kitchen sink) our brain thinks we‚Äôre drowning and an automatic survival mode starts up.\n\n\nHmm ... Isn‚Äôt that interesting. That the physical body wants to survive, even when our emotions tell us otherwise. Is it possible to live inside those split-second moments? \n\nLet‚Äôs see. \n\nI‚Äôm having a panic attack, but there‚Äôs no actual threat. I just know I want to hurt myself, or knock myself out. *Plunk* into the water. Thoughts slow down. Suddenly my body responds to what it perceives *is* an actual threat. And its response is to *survive.* \n\n\nThis is the strength they talk about in superhero origin stories. When all is lost, and something inside kicks in. It‚Äôs power. It‚Äôs courage. IT‚ÄôS YOU. ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nSometimes I yell and scream into the water, at everyone and everything who programmed me to flinch in this way. \n\n[PERSONAL NOTE: I‚Äôm allowed to be angry at them, forever. I‚Äôm allowed to never, ever forgive the monsters in my life. Denying them my forgiveness has no bearing on my value, importance or worthiness as a person. *Nor does it impede my ability to love others empathetically and sincerely.* I can hate my abusers and still be a good person. My hate for them is not going to rot me.]\n\n\n##Dealing with Panic attacks: \n\n\nGrounding myself. From where I‚Äôm sitting, I try to name five things I can hear, four things I can smell, three things I can touch, etc. I change this up. Or sometimes, if I‚Äôm having a hard time switching from sense to sense in my panic, I‚Äôll just count as many things as I can hear with my eyes closed. I say them out loud, to hear my voice outside of my skull for a change. My therapist and I made a self-soothe kit for me. It has something for each sense: a swatch of supersoft faux fur, a bottle of lavender oil, gin-gin ginger chews, a little music box thing, and a few really pretty clear blue marbles. I‚Äôll go through each one mindfully. Remember holding marbles up to your eye as a kid? Neither did I until I tried it again. What would be in your Self-Soothe kit?\n\n\n\n##Exercise. \n\nI got an elliptical machine on Craigslist for cheap. I don‚Äôt have to leave my house or deal with people when I need to burn off energy. 20 minutes of cardio helps me sleep through the night. And as I‚Äôve posted in here before, I look and feel 15 years younger due to trauma and memory loss, so perhaps that‚Äôs the universe giving me a do-over! I want my physical health to keep up with how young I feel emotionally. My cat is my trainer.\n\nEdit: My routine is more important to me than trying to top each workout with the next one. The other day I got on my elliptical machine for eleven minutes. Like, 0.3 miles. And I practiced being okay with that. I even made a point to post a victory post on IG about it with my ‚Äòstats.‚Äô 11 min / 0.3 mi / 170 cal. It‚Äôs important to me that I count these smaller steps as victories and progress, not just the big strides. It makes it easier to appreciate the tiny bits of progress in all other areas of my life. \n\n\n##Scaling down my social circle. \n\nI used to work in theatre and performing arts, and was constantly trying to fit every party, every event and play, every coffee date, every vacation, every road trip, every camping weekend into every spare second of my life. I was a workaholic, topping out at about 80 hours a week sometimes. After my last suicidal attempt, I wasn‚Äôt well enough to meet up with anyone, or work more than 30 hours a week. 99% of my friends and family faded away, sometimes out of resentment towards me for being ‚Äúflaky‚Äù or not reciprocating their friendship in a way I wish I could. Now that it‚Äôs been two years, I‚Äôm realizing that maybe I‚Äôve gotten better *because* I shouldn‚Äôt be working more than that. I feel a sense of stability *because* I don‚Äôt socialize nearly as much as I used to. I have self-forgiveness for not being well enough or having the right programming to sustain many close friendships. SELF FORGIVENESS. The ones that stuck around are my fucking *family* now. And it feels so good to understand what Family is *supposed* to be, and that I have some. I‚Äôve *had some all along.* I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the flowers, if I hadn‚Äôt gotten rid of all the weeds. \n\n\n##my timeline is unconventional. \n\nAt my age I‚Äôm obviously not going to have the traditional college-marriage-kids-career plan that so many of my peers do. Or ANY plan, for that matter. I‚Äôve had to remove myself from friends, or social circles that cause me to have negative conversations with myself about this. *This includes social media accounts.* It‚Äôs not that they are bad people. I just need to feel represented within my environment, and I realized that I get to choose that environment. Sure, I‚Äôve had people not understand why I‚Äôm fading out of their group, but I *can‚Äôt* care about what they think about me. It‚Äôs a slippery slope for me. (My truest friends have understood this, and do not write me off when I feel strong enough to hang out again. Unconditional love, yo.)\n\n\n##Dealing with feeling suicidal: \n\nWhen I‚Äôm in the throes of it, I have to force myself into the reality of what is *really* going on: \n\n*I have an illness that causes me to see and feel things that aren‚Äôt real, INCLUDING MY ASSESSMENT OF MYSELF.*\n\nI am emotionally hallucinating. \n\n\nI repeat this silently to myself. I‚Äôll write it on something permanent, in Sharpie. I admit I‚Äôve tagged bathroom stalls with this statement. \n\nI think of people who are having a difficult night with their cancer, or lupus, or MS, or fibromyalgia: *god damn it- this fucking illness wants me dead. Fuck this illness. It‚Äôs the illness not me that wants me dead.* This thought oscillates with *I fucking wish I was dead* but the point is that it keeps oscillating. I fucking wish I was dead- no wait- it‚Äôs this illness that wants me dead and that should piss me off. \n\nIf I can move the feeling of deep shame into anger towards the things that‚Äôs making me feel the deep shame, I‚Äôve leveled up. I‚Äôve accepted it, but I‚Äôve stepped just outside of it. \n\n\n[PERSONAL NOTES] In moments when I‚Äôm violently suicidal, like, pretty much psychosis, I keep screens in front of me. Again, I know this is unconventional advice, lol. But I‚Äôm remembering back to when my ex husband first discarded me and how I literally couldn‚Äôt come out from under my bed for a week. I had my iPad playing twitch streams on one side of me, and reruns of Girls playing on my phone on the other side, at all times, for a week.  \n\nI must have texted someone to come help me, but I had no recollection of it until a friend of a friend who I barely knew showed up at my house with a small bag of groceries. I couldn‚Äôt eat, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. If I tore my eyes away from tv for a second, the darkest most painful thoughts and images would creep in. I‚Äôd made this little fort under my loft bed that made it look like my room was empty, if anyone were to come in. I literally needed to disappear into a different space. \n\nBefore this last time, I would feel suicidal, but not to the point of being so physically drained.   Before I could run to the bathroom and grab a box of pills, or get a box cutter and ‚Äî before my suicidal moments had had energy. This last time, I felt like I had been in an MMA fight. I physically couldn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt even make pee, I didn‚Äôt need to use the bathroom for days. I physically lost the ability to care for myself. \n\nLike a baby. I had made myself a crib, complete with a mobile. \n\nI needed to love myself like a baby. And you know what? THAT‚ÄôS OKAY. It kept me alive. This was my first foray into self-forgiveness. \n\nBecause I got thru that, I knew it was very  possible that it could happen again, and that if it did, I might not be as lucky. I‚Äôm only getting better and better at trying to die. \n\n*I need treat my urge to hurt or kill myself like it‚Äôs an addiction.* \n\nThis is why I sometimes say I‚Äôve ‚Äúbeen in recovery for three years.‚Äù The urges come up daily, and I have to acknowledge them without indulging them. It‚Äôs a conscious, step-by-step, one-day-at-a-time thing that is my priority. *Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,* etc etc etc. That prayer applies here too. \n\n\n##Prepare for those dark times.\n\n\nPut things you‚Äôd genuinely want to do if you weren‚Äôt feeling so low on a wall  calendar. Write them in when you think of them when you‚Äôre feeling well, so they‚Äôre there when you‚Äôre too dissociated or sad-sick to brainstorm ideas. Treat Yo‚Äôself! When I was fresh out of the hospital, one of the things my therapist suggested is planning fun things for myself and literally write them on a physical calendar, where I‚Äôd have to see it all the time. This was in May 2017, so I remember getting online and looking up what bands were touring in my area. I bought a single Thundercat ticket, a single Bonobo ticket, a single tickets to see some stand up comedy, etc. The shows were all in September/October, so whenever I had really dark moments I‚Äôd inevitably think to myself ‚ÄúOk well you can‚Äôt die because then you‚Äôll miss Thundercat.‚Äù And it doesn‚Äôt have to be things that cost money or required me to leave my home. I‚Äôve written ‚Äúbring lunch to the park‚Äù, ‚Äúmake a blanket fort and watch Interstellar in the dark‚Äù, ‚Äúbake cookies‚Äù on a calendar, and somehow the anticipation makes it feel like an official event when that day arrives. Friend: ‚Äúhey are you free this afternoon?‚Äù Me: (looks at calendar, sees ‚ÄòBaking Cookies‚Äô scrawled across today‚Äôs square) ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm sorry, looks like I made plans a while ago and I‚Äôm busy all day.‚Äù\n\n\n\n##Netflix\n\n‚Äî Did you know you can still add dvds-in-the-mail like old school style? After the hospital and after I got into my new apartment, it was one of the first things I did for myself. Everyone loves getting mail. What better mail than a movie you‚Äôve been wanting to see? And it‚Äôs automatic plans with yourself, a distraction if needed. The app that is used to queue the movies I want is now a detailed list of films, subjects, creative styles that I like. (More on the necessity of lists below.)  I have to say, *it‚Äôs a great feeling to see that red envelope sticking out of my mailbox.* It‚Äôs like having instant plans, with no pressure, no additional people needed. \n\n\n##Taking baths \n\n-or a long hot shower at least once a day. Psychologically it feels like being hugged. Then you realize that this is a way you can hug yourself, and it‚Äôs kind of lonely and sad, but it‚Äôs also gratifying and self-sufficient. Remembering to shower seems like a given, but there are days when I don‚Äôt even have enough oxytocin to do that. \n\n\nOn that same note, making myself a cup of hot chocolate or tea with intention (like, drag the chair to the window, find the softest blanket, *then* get the tea and bundle up with only the window to watch - oh what a good time for a grounding exercise. How many things can you hear? See?) If you had the perfectest mom or grandma, what would she do for you when you‚Äôre feeling small and sad? Do that for yourself. I am my own parent. I mean, I‚Äôve been my own parent my whole life, I‚Äôm just not always mad about it anymore. Sometimes I‚Äôm grateful.\n\n\n##Making lists of things I like. \n\nJust lists. Shows I‚Äôm currently into. Fashions. Books I should read. Movies I should watch. It helps so, so much when I‚Äôm dissociated.  I just wander around my apartment, reading all my lists. My dissociation can often be so dense that I can‚Äôt remember any details about my own personality. I can‚Äôt remember favorite *anythings* so  my lists help bring me back to earth. \n\nMaking a permanent list of my favorite foods and keeping it on the fridge. Have you ever had to go grocery shopping while dissociated? Yeah. Super useful. Also great for when someone wants to help you out and shop for you.\n\n##Spotify. \n\nMaking different playlists for myself. For different moods or occasions or exercise, etc. I spent 20 years of my life having no idea what music I liked. I‚Äôd forget what bands or songs were my favorite. What was that album I played on repeat last month because I couldn‚Äôt get enough of it? Fuck if I know. Like with foods, I don‚Äôt retain this kind of self-knowledge about music. *And I‚Äôm a musician!* Deep breath: SELF-FORGIVENESS. I can‚Äôt care that my brain doesn‚Äôt hold this stuff. That‚Äôs what post-it‚Äôs are for.\n\n\n##Accepting my depression. \n\nI have friends who legitimately suffer from deep depression; some who (seem to) have ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô from it. *I do not compare their progress to my own.*\nAt 43, I have accepted that I‚Äôm not going to recover from the kind I have. Mine is tangled in with CPTSD. So instead of beating myself up because my deep sadness is never really 100% gone, I just keep adding fun and happy things to my plate. I no longer spend so much energy trying to escape being sad. I just add more happy. \n\n\n##Accepting my depression in the moment. \n\nIf I‚Äôm sad, I let myself feel sad. I tell my work that I‚Äôm ‚Äúsick‚Äù and call in, because I AM. If I had an autoimmune disease, I‚Äôd have to take extra measures to prevent getting a cold, because my cold could last weeks longer than an average person‚Äôs. So:\n\n##I have an autoimmune disease of the emotional mind. Therefore, I am prone to emotional illnesses more often than others,  they can last longer than they do for others, and they can become lethal if not managed.\n\nExplaining it this way to myself and to others has helped redefine my mental illness. I treat myself differently than I used to when my depression gets bad. I‚Äôm *kinder* to myself, like when I have the flu. Trying to push through like normal is a definite trigger for shame becoming suicidal ideation for me. If I was in remission from a cancer that almost killed me, no one would judge me for not wanting to run a half-marathon. \n\n\n##SELF ACCEPTANCE. \n\n##I understand that i have a condition that literally keeps me from seeing all of myself accurately. So when someone tells me I‚Äôm amazing, I kind of have to believe them, even when I am in the depths of despair. \n\nThat feeling of worthlessness? Dispair? Self-hate? Wanting to fucking die?\n\nI try to work on moving from feeling worthless to *being pissed off that i have a disease that makes me feel worthless.* First I say it out loud, even if I don‚Äôt believe it yet. Then I think it internally, word for word. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm angry at this disease. I‚Äôm angry at my abusers for injuring me in this way. I‚Äôm angry.‚Äù That‚Äôs what *working on it* means to me. \n\nShame has lethargy, but anger has *energy.* Gets the blood pumping. I‚Äôll go for a walk, clean my house, workout, or write a bunch, or take a sandwich to the park. I‚Äôll go to a $5 movie alone (pre-pandemic). Or the library (also pre-pandemic). I‚Äôll work an extra work shift. I‚Äôll do some cardio. Something that uses physical energy. I use that energy in a positive way because that‚Äôs the ultimate revenge on my past abuse and subsequent illnesses. This might not be conventional advice, but the people who write the books of CPTSD usually don‚Äôt have it, so I‚Äôm dedicated to coming up with methods on my own.\n\nProgress is not a straight line. Often, it‚Äôs not even a line, it‚Äôs a loopy-loop chutes-n-ladders path, and all my pieces are from candyland. But if I count one space at a time, and accept the setbacks as part of the journey, I know I‚Äôll be okay.\n\n\nFor those with access to therapy, or similar I recommend DBT (dialectal behavioral therapy) courses to help sort out emotional reactions to past, present and future conditions. Originally designed for Borderline Personality Disorder, it has really helped me slow down my emotional ‚Äúflinching,‚Äù and helped me prioritize my actual needs vs. my emotional needs. My reasonable reactions from my emotional reactions. \nFor those who don‚Äôt, I started with free therapy programs thru the graduate programs at my local college. I discovered free trauma counseling through calling crisis lines as well, and I joined a few depression/anxiety groups on the MeetUp app. I also recommend the Mood Tracker app for self-observance and a great support system, and the Breathe Player app for focused breathing. \n\n\n##I will continue to add more to this as time goes by.\n\nPlease feel free to spread this around as needed. These are all things I wish I had started doing for myself decades ago.\n\nI just add things to it as I come up with them, and I must be doing something right because at 43, I finally feel like I‚Äôm moving forward, I‚Äôm not stuck. \n\n\nKind of like.... I finally invented a bike that I can ride after having both legs blown off in a war. I‚Äôll never be able to pretend I have legs, I‚Äôll always look down and be reminded of my pain and trauma‚Äî if I decide to look down. The point is I‚Äôm moving forward, so I have to focus on that. And also, *i made the bike* so I‚Äôm entitled to quietly feel like I‚Äôm a better at being a person than others who didn‚Äôt have to invent their own bikes. If that makes sense!\n\n\nI hope this helps some of you find some love inside yourselves. I appreciate you guys so, so much, just for being able to relate. Just for being here and being you. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è",

One of the most helpful things I've ever done in my own recovery was to reject the entire concept of forgiveness and insist that I have the right to be angry at my abusers.\n\nSelf-forgiveness is useful and important, but forgiving the people who hurt us? Fuck that noise.\n\n>Shame has lethargy, but anger has energy. \n\nA blogger I used to follow (sadly she took down her blog a while ago), said that she thought anger and despair were just the high energy and low energy states of the same emotion and that's really stuck with me.\n\n>I use that energy in a positive way because that‚Äôs the ultimate revenge on my past abuse and subsequent illnesses.\n\nYes! I have a good life now and that's the best revenge I could have on the people who tried to destroy me/stood around and watched.\n\nI appreciate you too, it's so comforting to know I'm not just weird and broken, that there are other people just like me <3",

    "body": "Throwaway since my husband knows my Reddit account ‚Äì oops?\n\nI‚Äôve met a lot of people who say that they have allergies and they don‚Äôt. I am not one of them. I am highly allergic to all fragrances. When I used Irish Spring soap once, I had a gross rash on my entire body. My hands felt like I was wearing gloves. Once I used sunscreen before a hike and my face got all red and swelled up like nobody‚Äôs business ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt even open my eyes. I recently developed an allergy to Dove sensitive skin soap (I know, what the fuck?) and I had to spend the entire day doped up on Zyrtec. One time I worked out next to a lady wearing a bucketful of perfume at the gym and I had an awful sinus headache that lasted all day, all night, and into the next day. \n\nMy allergy isn‚Äôt particularly life threatening, I know. But it is uncomfortable and irritating. The reason I gave you all of those examples is because I don‚Äôt think most people really understand the effect of fragrance allergies. One of those people is my mother in law. \n\nI‚Äôve been married to my husband (Stephen) for almost three years now. This means I‚Äôve exchanged gifts for two Christmases and three birthdays. And every single one of those times, she‚Äôs given me perfume and heavily fragranced soaps. She works selling ‚Äúnatural fragrances‚Äù like lavender oil, etc, and before you ask, yes, I‚Äôm very allergic to those too. She is aware of my allergy and is of the opinion that it is a ‚Äúfake allergy‚Äù that I use to get Stephen‚Äôs attention. She also says, as an alternating opinion that I just need to try more fragrances to find out ‚Äúwhich ones I can use‚Äù. \n\nI am in favor of the ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù mentality, so I will just take her gifts and regift them, usually. But she gets very, VERY upset to smell me and smell that I am not using them, and to not see them around the house. Even having them in the house gets me stuffed up and gives me headaches. \n\nI decided enough was enough. This Christmas, she gave me a fragrance-heavy gift. I told her very gently and politely that I can‚Äôt use the gift because of my allergies and that she might be better off giving it to someone who can truly appreciate it. She blew up at me, telling me that I smell bad and that I‚Äôm leaning on the crutch of a fake allergy to seem special. She tells me that I stink to high heaven and I should be covering it up with her perfume. Nobody has ever told me I smell bad and I talked to my friends to see. They didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about. I simply use all-natural fragrance-free soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and deodorants. I shower at least once a day. \n\nStephen and I had a little argument after Christmas. He said that I should stop making her feel bad and maybe just try a little of the all-natural perfumes. I told him that I couldn‚Äôt, that it would be painful, and he said that I was being inflexible. He didn‚Äôt apologize but two weeks ago he told me that he spoke to his mother and that she would stop giving me the fragrances as gifts.\n\nShe came over for dinner a couple of nights ago as a peace offering. When she came into the door, a wall of perfume hit me ‚Äì she‚Äôd never worn so much before! She was carrying a basket of soaps, lotions, and perfumes, all of them scented, and told me she‚Äôd researched and found the most ‚Äúall-natural‚Äù ones, but they looked the same as before. At dinner, I had to excuse myself because I was getting a horrible headache. I‚Äôm sure my sinuses were swollen like balloons. After that dinner, Stephen told me I was being overdramatic and she was just trying to make amends, but she‚Äôd brought the perfume into my house despite my explicit instructions that it would make me ill.\n\ntl;dr: My mother-in-law keeps giving me perfume as gifts even though I‚Äôm very allergic. My husband thinks I‚Äôm being overdramatic. Am I? ",

I've been a lurker of this sub for a few months but have never posted before, so hello :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday I realized something truly amazing, and I'd like to share it with you all.  I've been practicing yoga on and off for about 6-7 years, but consistently only for the past 2 years. 6 months ago I went through a really big life change (moved to the US from Europe where I had been living for the past 5 years), the only thing that really helped me through this abrupt change was the consistency of my practice. \n\nFor the past month or so, I've been trying to bring my husband to a class at the community-driven studio I go to or get him to start practicing because I think it would be really good for him. He was a bit reluctant as he does not want to make a fool out of himself or be vulnerable in front of strangers. I understand this completely because that is something I went through when I started practicing. So I decided to help him at home. \n\nWe started doing small sessions in our living room, nothing too intense, just 20-30 minutes every other day. He likes it a lot and I feel quite proud of myself. Sphinx and supine twists are his favorite. He still struggled with downward dog because he has carpal tunnel *(any tips/help with this other than pressing through your knuckles or getting on your fists?)*. For savasana I play sigur ros and put lavender oil on his neck, this is his favorite part. \n\nHowever yesterday I realized how much I liked out sessions because I was helping him. So much that I've decided that in the summer I am going to pursue a YTT course, to deepen my practice and to help guide people I love into the practice. I talked to him about this and he said that it would be great for me, that so far he feels like I've been very good at helping him get more acquainted with yoga and that if I could do that with him (a person who had literally no interest in yoga and is stiff to the bone) he can only imagine how much good it can bring to other people. This truly makes me happy and I can't wait to share the beauty of yoga with the people close to me <3",

It reduces the wrist angle substantially and it'll allow him to progress more quickly and will ultimately HELP his CT.\n\nAlso make sure he warms up his wrists with basic hand stretches (arm straight out, pull palm back; light individual finger stretches; forearm straight up, fold wrist forward (toward palm) pull down gently). Make sure he modifies side planks by dropping a knee or going to his forearm. Also do a lot of neck and shoulder release. He'll see a lot more progress in the hands if he frees his shoulders.",

    "body": "*Edit: Added a video walkthrough, a photo of me with the backpack on, and extra thoughts I had about the trip.*\n\n\\-----\n\nHi everyone! Yesterday, I returned home from my very first solo-travel trip across Europe. It was my first time ever in Europe.\n\nFor context, I used to be a chronic over-packer (ie. a full suitcase and 1 week‚Äôs worth of underwear for a weekend trip) but this sub helped me throw all of that out the window and I finally lived out of a single 40L backpack (of which I only used about 30 - 35L) for a full month. I‚Äôm really proud of myself and I‚Äôm never going back!\n\n# [Here is an Imgur album detailing my entire setup.](https://imgur.com/gallery/vmPMNAA)\n\n# [Here is a full video walk-through of my entire setup.](https://imgur.com/gallery/5kCdE2D)\n\n# [Here is a reference photo of me (ft. dog) with my backpack on.](https://imgur.com/a/JCLIDYQ)\n\n‚Äî\n\n# Trip Route\n\nLondon ‚Äî> Berlin ‚Äî> Prague ‚Äî> Vienna ‚Äî> Budapest ‚Äî> Rome ‚Äî> London\n\n‚Äî\n\n# About Myself\n\n26F at 5‚Äô3‚Äù (160 cm) and 120 lb (54 kg), though when I returned I was 110 lb (49 kg).\n\nThat said, despite losing weight, I gained quite a bit of strength and resilience. At the beginning of the trip, even though I was heavier, I would feel tired carrying the backpack after 15 minutes. By the end of the trip, despite losing 10 lb, I barely noticed the weight on my back.\n\n‚Äî\n\n# Backpack\n\n[Highland 40L Backpack by Mountain Warehouse](https://www.mountainwarehouse.com/ca/highland-40l-backpack-p23845.aspx/)\n\nTotal weight: 20 lb (9 kg)\n\nThis backpack wasn‚Äôt originally my first choice but it served me really well - and I got it on sale for CAD$60. Score!\n\nAt first, I did the typical move of buying an Osprey Farpoint 40 and, contrary to popular opinion, I *really* disliked it. It was also over $200, which at my budget, was a bit of a turn-off.\n\nIt felt uncomfortable on my back, the weight distribution was all wrong despite fiddling with the hip straps and shoulders forever, and I felt like a turtle with everything bulging outwards from my back rather than being distributed along the slope of my body. I also wasn‚Äôt a fan of the extra layer that hides the backpack straps - maybe some would like it but I felt like it was just overkill.\n\nI had purchased 2 other backpacks to try out (Gregory Compass 40 & Venture 40L) which I ultimately ruled out due to the former having no hip straps (though I loved the open, clamshell design) and the latter distributing the volume too heavily along the base, which was quite uncomfortable.\n\nUltimately, I‚Äôd say the Highland 40L served me *extremely* well. It felt like an extension of myself! It‚Äôs super durable with strong zippers and good quality materials. It has lots of really useful and easily-accessible compartments from top-to-bottom. It was super easy to pack and compress, even on top of my packing cubes. As a smaller individual with a narrow frame, much of my backpack decision-making was dictated by how adjustable the backpack could be. I pulled everything to the tightest setting and the Highland 40L was the only one that felt like it fit me.\n\nThere was an expandable portion at the top of the main compartment that I never used, and now that I think about it, I should have just used that portion for souvenirs and gifts but it honestly never occurred to me. Oh well. Otherwise, I packed the main volume to the brim.\n\n‚Äî\n\n# [Contents](https://imgur.com/gallery/vmPMNAA)\n\n‚Äî\n\n**Top Compartment**\n\n* sleep pouch (eye mask, ear plugs)\n* medicine pouch (painkillers, sleeping pills, anti-nausea, etc.)\n* inflatable neck pillow\n* KN95 masks\n* wet wipes\n\n‚Äî\n\n**Bottom Compartment**\n\n* shoe tote bag (a pair of white canvas flats and a pair of flip-flops)\n* dirty laundry mesh bag\n\n‚Äî\n\n**2x Side Compartments**\n\nThis isn‚Äôt detailed in the Imgur post but I used it for random stuff like extra wipes, tissues, power bank, pens - literally anything. Nothing was specifically packed in the two side compartments because I liked how slender my backpack was and wanted to keep it from bulging out on the sides. The goal for this backpack was the distribute the volume slimly along my spine, from neck to hip.\n\n‚Äî\n\n**Main Compartment**\n\nThough I was a little dubious about the lack of a clamshell design, I actually had a really good time just pulling things out and living out of my packing cubes.\n\n* miscellaneous pouch\n* portable day pack\n* portable toiletry bag\n* collapsible silicone lunchbox\n* packing cube 1/2\n* packing cube 2/2\n* iPad with Bluetooth keyboard\n\n‚Äî\n\n**Packing Cubes (aka. clothes)**\n\n* 2x pack towels (1x large body towel, 1x small hand towel)\n* 1x grey tank top\n* 1x green sweat wick t-shirt\n* 1x dark blue fleece sweater\n* 2x black cropped long sleeves\n* 1x light blue clubbing dress\n* 1x plaid pants\n* 1x jeans 1x thin long white blouse (bought in Rome)\n* 1x laundry mesh bag\n* 1x leopard print bikini top\n* 2x bikini bottom (leopard print/black)\n* 1x sport pyjama shorts shorts\n* 1x white linen shorts\n* 1x white jean short\n* 1x cropped biker leggings\n* 1x black leggings\n* 1x lightweight black joggers\n* 1x plaid spaghetti-strap dress\n* 1x striped cropped t-shirt\n* 1x beige t-shirt\n* 4x bralette/bra/sticky bra\n* bucket hat\n\n‚Äî\n\n**Toiletry Bag**\n\nThis was a godsend - I truly couldn‚Äôt have traveled as smoothly as I did without this. It basically unfolds into a mini bathroom cabinet complete with a small mirror.\n\n[Hiking Travel Bag from Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.ca/en/hiking-travel-accessories/303528-31800-travel-toiletry-bag-black.html#/23215-demodelsize-254no_size/32054-demodelcolor-8514768)\n\nIt has a generous main compartment, which I used to house 7x pairs of underwear and 7x pairs of socks.\n\nThe main zipper compartments you can see in the front include:\n\n* toothbrush/toothpaste\n* light makeup tools\n* shampoo/conditioner/body wash\n* contacts/fluid/eye drops\n* tweezers/nail cutter\n* sunscreen/lotion/deodorant/toner\n\nIn the back, there are two more zipper compartments, which I used for:\n\n* hair ties\n* jewelry\n* makeup remover pad\n* flat comb\n\n‚Äî\n\n**Miscellaneous Pack**\n\n* travel charger (US/UK/Europe/Asia)\n* 6 ft. iPhone charger\n* headlamp\n* clothesline\n* normal charger head\n\n‚Äî\n\n**Extra Items**\n\n* flat folder of important documents (ie. travel insurance, photocopies of passport, extra cash)\n* [20100 mAh power bank](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00X5RV14Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n* extra plastic bags and pouches\n\n‚Äî\n\nLast, but *certainly* not least (and also technically not part of my one-bag setup but it would be a folly not to mention it) is‚Ä¶ **my fanny pack**! It was on my body at all times and I quite literally would rather travel with one less packing cube than without this little trooper.\n\n[Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/bags/Everywhere-Belt-Bag/_/prod8900416)\n\n* wallet\n* hand sanitizer\n* lip balm\n* lipstick\n* wireless earphones\n* hand lotion\n* wired earphones\n* [chargeable, electronic rape whistle/personal alarm](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B082KBY8B4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n* flat power bank (5000 mAh) and iPhone charging cord\n* iPhone\n* passport/emergency cash (not pictured)\n\nI usually also carried some chewing gum and tissue packs as well.\n\n‚Äî\n\n# Summary\n\nAll things considered, I‚Äôm *really* happy with how my first time turned out! I don‚Äôt think I was lacking for anything, and if I ever needed replenishing or was missing anything (ie. I didn‚Äôt bring hand lotion or body lotion), it was an easy matter to drop by a drug mart.\n\nHere are my post-trip thoughts:\n\n1. **I wish I didn‚Äôt bring my fleece sweater.** I never wore it and it took up *a lot* of space. My trip was during the month of May and everywhere I went, it was quite warm. Even when I was cold, my soft shell jacket was more than enough.\n2. **Though I didn‚Äôt use my clubbing dress at all, I would bring it again.** It doesn‚Äôt wrinkle and barely took up any space. As someone who likes to look good/feel good, having a nice dress in my back pocket (or backpack, rather, hehe) was comforting.\n3. **I wish I had brought an extra t-shirt and tank top.** So versatile and easy to pack! I would have cut the extra pair of shorts and one of the long-sleeve crops.\n4. **I wish I brought a proper long-sleeve, not just crop tops.** Just a long-sleeve, thin cotton shirt would've been fine.\n5. Might just be me, but I found myself more susceptible to getting tired and sick, especially in a foreign continent where I wasn‚Äôt used to the germs or viruses of the region. I ended up **buying vitamin C tablets and took them every day**, but that was only after I got sick (I got a sinus infection in Prague and Vienna). In the future, I will prep it in advance and build it into my routine, starting even before my trip.\n6. I actually forgot to bring a hat/cap (silly me) so I bought a bucket hat halfway through my trip. **I also regret not bringing a proper case for my sunglasses** and ended up crushing them by accident. :(\n7. **Extra cash.** I brought ‚Ç¨200 that I split into ‚Ç¨50 portions. I put ‚Ç¨50 in my wallet, ‚Ç¨50 clipped to my passport, ‚Ç¨50 in my backpack, and ‚Ç¨50 under the sole of my left shoe pad. Sometimes, I'd run out of cash. But thankfully, I had extra... in my shoe. Score.\n8. **Don't forget (extra) masks!** COVID requirements really vary (some places require them on transit, some don't) and it's easy to go from one city to another and be slapped with totally different regulations. For the most part, everywhere is rather relaxed, but my mask broke right before I entered St Peter's Basilica and that was more stressful than it needed to be.\n9. **I didn't really end up using my headlamp as most hostels included small lights with each bed.** I'm not entirely sure if I'll bring it again, but it's not a bad thing to have, especially if you're planning to venture out of the city. It's always a godsend when I'm camping!\n10. I did end the trip with the tiniest tear near the top compartment of my backpack - definitely because I stuffed that area. I'll get it mended, but **I'll be warier of overstuffing in the future.** I got a bit spoiled by how sturdy this backpack is, haha.\n11. **The inflatable neck pillow was fantastic** \\- I used it everywhere. Though I didn't use my sleeping mask and won't bring it again, having a 'sleep pouch' with everything you need for proper sleep hygiene and extra ear plugs was very comforting. I even ended up giving away extra earplugs to fellow travelers who were lacking. The feeling of being so prepared to not only help yourself but help others is *really* awesome.\n12. **Put everything back where it is supposed to go.** A few times during my trip, I would use something and shove it somewhere else in my bag or forget to replenish it. Every single time, I suffered for it, whether it was forgetting to recharge my power bank or realizing that I left my lip balm in my toiletry bag instead of my fanny pack while I was out. While traveling, rely on your own routine. It'll save you lots of small headaches.\n13. **Even if you don't use your medication, having it  = peace of mind.** I brought a lot of extra stuff that I never usually use (anti-nausea, caffeine pills, sleeping pills, supplements, etc.) and even if you can pick something up at a drug mart, it sucks having to look for one when you have a pounding headache and no Advil. This brings me to my next point...\n14. **Google Translate's camera-translate function is your best friend.** When I got sick, I was constantly looking for the proper meds and the camera was amazing. I would recommend downloading the languages of the countries you are visiting in advance because for some reason, every single drug mart I entered cut off my service a few steps in.\n15. **Data is cheap in Europe. Just get more than you think you need.** I got 14GB for the month, which is 4GB more than I usually use, so I thought it was enough. It was not, and I had to drop an extra ‚Ç¨20 a mere 5 days before the end of my trip just to get 50GB (the smallest plan they had in Rome) that I wouldn't finish. Just get extra right from the get-go and shed that concern from your mind, period.\n16. Everyone says this, but I'll stress it again. **Bring flip-flops.** I stayed at a particularly smelly/dirty hostel in Prague (sorry Hostel One Home) and I couldn't have done it without the flip flops. They were always the first thing out of my bag whenever I arrived somewhere.\n17. **Make your own breakfast!** I eventually learned to start grocery shopping for my breakfast/brunch stuff. Great money-saver and it made me feel better about splurging for a nice dinner. Also, it's really cool to see how locals eat there - supermarkets in Europe are so different from where I come from. Most hostels have good kitchen setups and honestly, I needed it. I was mainly in central Europe and while the food was cheap, the whole meat/cheese/carbs diet that mainly consisted of sausages, potatoes, and beer got old fast. I was craving a stick of carrot and a single egg all the time.\n18. I should have mentioned this, but I also **made a small spray bottle mixture of lavender oil, citronella oil, rubbing alcohol, and water for bed bugs**. I luckily never encountered any, but I've heard so many horror stories that I wanted to be safe rather than sorry. I spritzed my bed upon arrival and every night before bed and got to enjoy a nice calming aroma as I drifted to sleep. This was also really helpful when encountering the occasional smelly dorm-mate; sometimes, the smell of BO can end up permeating the entire dorm. More than once, this has saved my sense of smell! At the end of my trip, I had half a bottle left, so I gave it to a girl I met (who was just embarking on her own month-long solo travel!) to serve her on her journey.*Note: Bed bugs aren't necessarily a sign of the hostel's cleanliness. Travelers can trek them in from a previous hostel too. Search up ways to identify infestations and bed bug bites before you travel for peace of mind.*\n19. **Sharing is caring!** By the end of my trip, I had given away a padlock (I brought two, just in case), extra granola bars, a bed-bug spray bottle, hair ties, extra gum/tissues/wet wipes, and more. It felt *really* rewarding to be able to help other travelers and shed extra items.\n20. **Last but not least, I** ***highly*** **recommend keeping a daily journal.** I wrote of my travels almost every day that I was abroad and it is so, so great. Even a few notes, a few bullets, are good. It's enough to help you remember. After a month, everything starts blurring together, and you'll be glad that you kept a record. It doesn't have to be a journal! It could be a calendar, daily Instagram stories... anything!\n\nSomething I realized while on the road was that when you're one-bagging on a solo travel trip, **the past you is the present you's best friend**. I am a huge self-critic but this trip (and the reception to this post) has given me a newfound appreciation... for myself. Lol! Cue narcissism.\n\nThe truth is, a lot of traumatizing things actually ended up happening to me during my trip (ie.  racism/sexism/harassment), but at the end of the day, I was always able to rely completely on my own one-bag. The trip would've been so much worse without the work I did to plan ahead and pack well. One-bagging is the ability to rely on yourself - and to be proud of yourself for it. My first solo trip didn't grant me any grand epiphanies but rather showed me how prepared and resilient I could be.\n\nI hope this helped! This community was my bible before I left and I want to give back even a fraction of what it gave me.\n\nAlright, that's enough feels, haha. All in all, I had a really great time and I can't wait for my next solo (and most definitely one-bag) trip. Thank you, danke, dekuji, ciao grazie!",

    "body": "Hi guys!!\n\nSo a while back I did a post on here [on my fungal acne transformation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/au4igp/fungal_acne_10_day_transformation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) \n\nAnd I thought that I would update you all on how I was doing and the progress I‚Äôve made since than.\n\nSince being diagnosed with FA and my last post my skin has been doing great and I‚Äôve only had one very minor FA breakout but it wasn‚Äôt bad.\n\nAfter reading a lot about essential oils and their power I‚Äôve decided to purchase tea tree and lavender oil and added them into my routine.\nBuying these two oils was probably one of the best things I‚Äôve done to my skin to be honest!!\n\nTea tree and lavender oil mixed with my witch hazel toner did so much good to my skin to the point I no longer need to use Nizoral on my face.\nProbiotics and Caprylic Acid too but more about it at the end of my post!\n\n[pics of my face right now ](https://imgur.com/a/sugzd3E) \n\n[here‚Äôs what it used to look like](https://imgur.com/a/YjweLq9) \n\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently using:\n-Remedy soap (tea tree and peppermint all natural body soap).\n\n-SAL 3 sulfur soap (every other day)\n\n-my DIY witch hazel toner with added tea tree oil and lavender (for 1oz of witch hazel I used 7 drops of lavender and 5 of tea tree).\nI don‚Äôt use it as toner.I just spray my entire face with it and wait for it to absorb.\n\n\n-Hada Labo premium lotion \n\n-Hada Labo hyaluronic gel or Ziaja urea face cream (I also add one drop of tea tree or lavender to my Ziaja moisturizer).\n\n-Every other day at night I also use 20% Azelaic Acid;I use it after Hada Labo premium lotion. \n(Make sure to wait for at least 20mins for the Hada Labo lotion to fully absorb before you proceed with Azelaic Acid).\n\n[list of products I‚Äôm currently using ](https://imgur.com/a/ovENRsP)\n\nThe only thing that‚Äôs not pictured is SAL3 sulfur soap.\n\n\n*******\n*******\n\n      Extras:\n\nHere‚Äôs another thing thing that I believe helped me tremendously;\n\nPROBIOTICS AND CAPRYLIC ACID!!\n\nThese two also helped me internally!!\nI‚Äôve been taking for over a month probiotics and for almost month and a half Caprylic acid daily.\n\nI strongly suggest Caprylic acid to be taken orally if you have ANY type of acne or dealing with FA!!\nI did a lot of reading about Caprylic acid and it‚Äôs benefits and I‚Äôm a living proof for it that it does work because I don‚Äôt even get regular breakouts anymore since I‚Äôve started taking Caprylic acid internally.\n\nI also do once a week bentoine clay mask mixed with apple cider vinegar.\nNot sure if that‚Äôs helping or not but surely it won‚Äôt make any damage to my skin either.\n\nAs far as witch hazel goes it doesn‚Äôt need to be the one I have pictured.\nThis is actually just an empty bottle that I had from my previous witch hazel.\nIf you are going to do DIY witch hazel toner/spray with essential oils make sure your witch hazel is ALCOHOL FREE and stored in a dark bottle since you are adding essential oils inside.\nMake sure you also shake the mixture very well and ALWAYS store it in the fridge.\n\nALSO:\n\n         Witch Hazel is a water based carrier for essential oil so it‚Äôs absolutely fine to dilute essential oils with water based carriers such as witch hazel as long as it‚Äôs an alcohol free(essential oils don‚Äôt need to be diluted only with carrier oils!).For example two other really good water based carriers for essential oils are aloe Vera gel or lotion.\n\n\n       Another thing that I also would like to add is that I‚Äôm currently using again non FA safe make up products and with a current routine knock on wood everything is well :)\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask,I‚Äôll be happy to answer!\n\nAs always sorry for any grammar mistakes I made üôàüôà \n",

I have been struggling with FA on my back and chest since the winter months (probably from working out in long sleeve shirts and staying in my workout clothes too long). It was getting sooo bad and my usual acne toolkit (acids, retinoids, etc) was not working. \nSummer was coming and I started researching new things. It sounded like FA so I started washing with head and shoulders, then Nizoral and using jock itch cream. I saw some improvements from that but it never went away fully and with some hormonal fluctuations I had two days where it was the worst it‚Äôs ever been, which was also two days before leaving to go on a camping trip with friends.   On the day before leaving for my trip I picked up witch hazel toner and TTO, diluted 7 drops per 1 oz. I sprayed it on before bed and I‚Äôm not kidding that I went from 20+ angry little red bumps on my chest to zero inflammation/clear skin, my back was 90% better too. I can‚Äôt thank you enough! I wonder if the 2+ weeks of shampoo and cream too or if it was just the TTO? I guess time will tell. Thank you again!",

    "body": "Most of the products I use are K-beauty. I got really into them about a year ago and my skin has never been better! Granted, I still use some western products but that‚Äôs so far limited to my retinoid (adapalene gel 0,1%) and my face oil (hempseed oil). My morning and evening routine are typically similar with a few exceptions.\nI also cycle adapalene and the exfoliant. I designated Sunday as a rest day for some reason lol. When I remember to, I use the cicaplast baume at night on Sunday. The last pic is my current skin. Pic was taken a day before this post‚ò∫Ô∏èü´∞üèΩ\n\nMorning routine \nCleanse>treat>protect\nCelimax cleanser\nMugwort essence as toner\nMelano cc to treat pigmentation (the only thing I struggle with nowüò©)\nCelimax pore dark spot serum is a very recent purchase (I have medium expectations)\nBOJ eye serum is love in an eye cream! (J‚Äôadore)\nThe isntree exfoliating moisturiser with 5% PHA is great (I‚Äôve been skipping straight to sunscreen lately tho)\nBOJ relief sun rice probiotics sunscreen is of course my final step et voila!\n\nComments:\nThe cleanser is great and truly does balance skin pH. I just don‚Äôt get why it has so many potentially irritating ingredients. After I use it, my skin feels baby soft, but it contains lavender oil, bergamot oil, limonene and a lot of fragrant ingredients! I didn‚Äôt notice this before I made the purchase tbh. Luckily, i‚Äôm not sensitive to fragrance for now at least so no complaints, but I think i‚Äôll try a different cleanser (also low pH) once this runs out. It‚Äôs so economical tho, it‚Äôs crazyüòÇ\n\nMelano CC: It works but slowly and steadily! It took a while to notice. I actually thought it wasn‚Äôt doing anything initially. Now i‚Äôve added txa from the dark spot serum, I hope things will speed up a bit. It works though and is not at all irritating so I still recommend.\n\nMy night routine is the same plus a few other calming serums like the PKL calming moisture serum and the snail mucin from Cosrx(lovee this one btw). I also double cleanse with an oil cleanser from hadalabo followed by the celimax one. Depending on the day of the week, I either exfoliate or use my retinoid, but never both on the same night! The final step is the face oil which I acknowledge isn't technically necessary, but I love it so muchüò≠ so yea. \n\nHopefully this post helps someone. As you can probably see, I am a man with skin of colourüòÇ. not the usual AB consumer you see everyday, but yea. I fully believe asian beauty especially K-beauty products are miles ahead of what the west offers. I'd happily answer any questions you might have‚ò∫Ô∏èü©µ",

Here it is: [https://youtu.be/L80Yjz-c8Zs](https://youtu.be/L80Yjz-c8Zs)\n\nOk, very long story short... I own a small company that sells brewing (beer) and distilling equipment. Every summer I visit friends who own a lavender farm in Colorado to test new equipment and new methods for distilling lavender oil and hydrosol. We generally film the experiments and publish them on YouTube. This farm happens to be located near Charles Hoskinson's CO residence (we think).\n\nAnyway, we're all big fans of Charles and Cardano, and the owners of the farm reached out to him to see if he'd like to come over for a farm tour and also to brew beer for my YouTube channel. Fat chance, right? Well, he said yes!! (Mind BLOWN).\n\nWhen we have guests on our channel, we try to match the vibe of the guest and do / talk about things that they're into. Our plan is to keep it light in terms of technical stuff, but we'll definitely cover the basics. And we also want to get into some of his personal interests. But to keep things cohesive, it would be helpful to somehow relate everything to beer, if possible. What does the r/cardano community think we should ask Charles!?\n\nAlso, I'd link our YouTube channel, but don't know what the rules are here. I'll edit later if linking is OK. Or someone can just post in the comments. It's Clawhammer Supply on YouTube.",

Try using a gentle cleanser like Neutrogena liquid or bar soap. Maybe every other night, wash your face with Cerave SA cleanser. Slowlyyyyyy!  Slowly wash. Literally count to 30 when going in cuticular motions in each section of your face. I started being more mindful of this and my skin really got better. The ingredients need time to work. \n\nUse a gentle toner after showering. Neutrogena wins here for me again. Although you may have oily skin, you do not need to strip it of moisture to help it. Once a week, maybe on Sunday evening: do a peel. I like the ordinary. Read the before and after care no matter what peel you decide on and follow it. BE PATIENT. Don‚Äôt exfoliate constantly trust me. \n\nNow for your makeup. Research some silicone based primers and foundations. The ordinary makes a silicone primer. I use it. As far as foundation, I know Lanc√¥me has an awesome silicone based foundation! But I am sure there are many more.  \n\nI had the same problem as you until I figured out that silicones are my best friend when it comes to makeup.",

I bought all matching stuff too and no matter what I did, this happened like in the picture. There are two major things that have changed it.\n\nThe first one is using skincare as a step in my makeup routine. I normally have blemish free pretty even skin. But when I would use a serum and then a oil free moisturizer, it made the base for applying products so much smoother. It looks like you might be exfoliating too much too, try to only do it like once a week, or you might want to try a different product for it. Using a primer once the moisturizer sinks in really helps to \"fill in\" pores so they are much more smooth and blurred. \n\nThe second thing I did was cut the amount of product I use in half. I was using way too much foundation and so I started with using just a tiny bit, and building it up little by little instead of putting the entire amount I think I'm going to use on my face.  I guess lastly you might want to try setting spray, and I use it right before my foundation and a light spray when everything is done.  it really helps the makeup not slide on my nose or face and my pores are as invisible as I can make them üòÜ.",

    "body": "I confess that I am someone who likes to try many things out, so in all of my births, I admittedly did try a ton of different things when it came to pain relief and thought it could be interesting to \"review\" them :) To preface: I'm in Germany, at the hospitals and birth centers here births are generally midwife led and there tends to be a fairly wide variety of pain relief options.\n\n**Epidural:** I've had two epidurals out of 3 births. With my first I got my epidural relatively soon into active labor and with my third I had it for only the last 1.5 hours of labor on a low dose and didn't continue to dose it shortly prior to pushing. I was not a super huge fan of it with my first baby- it gave me the shakes and being confined to the bed made me claustrophobic, I had a catheter and didn't like it, and had a mild allergic reaction to the bandage. However it did take the edge off and allow me to rest, and I had retained placenta so it was handy to have the epidural for pain relief during manual removal. With my third baby it was much better experience, I didn't have it for long but it allowed me to rest a bit before pushing after a very long day/night plus I had to get induced with pitocin during labor, so the pitocin contractions really were brutal. I was able to be in an upright active position with my third baby (on my knees, holding on to the back of the bed) and that helped a lot- I even somehow managed not to tear.\n\n**Laboring in water/waterbirth:** I'm a fan. I labored in water with my first and third baby even though I didn't end up with a waterbirth with them, and had a waterbirth with my second. I've always found the water extremely soothing and relaxing, and really relieving for contractions. Lots of good mobility possibilites and loved not being hooked into tons of things.\n\n**Sterile water injections:** got one with my second baby shortly before I got into the birthing tub. Don't think it really did much for me but supposedly they can help with some back pain during labor.\n\n**Aromatherapy:** Hospitals and birth centers here generally offer aromatherapy as a possibility for labor. I had some orange oil put into my laboring tub with my first birth, sniffed lemon oil with my second baby during contractions, and sniffed lavender oil with my third when I got dizzy. None of these things necessarily took away pain or discomfort per se but they brought some sense of calm and relief.\n\n**Tylenol/paracetamol:** I was given this when I had prodromal labor with my second combined with codeine. HATED it. The combo of paracetamol with codeine made me very nauseous and dizzy and frankly didn't even do anything for pain relief. But I hear it can be quite helpful to take the edge off for some folks.\n\n**Massage/counterpressure:** during my births the midwives would usually show my husband or do it themselves, some massage/counterpressure on my lower back during contractions using either just hands or a massage ball. It definitely felt nice and helped me breathe through contractions.\n\n**Warming pads:** I used these in my third labor to take some of the initial edge off on my lower back. It felt pretty soothing and did help with early contraction relief.\n\n**Suspended ceiling scarf:** I occasionally held onto one during tub labor for added support and found it helpful to have something to really pull on during a contraction.\n\n**Hypnobirthing:** I practiced hypnobirthing techniques before my second baby and found them very calming and made it easier to breathe through contractions. I didn't really practice with my third, but utilized some of the techniques during early labor and it was especially handy during pushing. I felt so much calmer pushing my third baby out than the other two births and focused on breathing.",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens¬Æ B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens¬Æ B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

It looked like a similar mask to [Hanacure](https://www.hanacure.com/products/the-all-in-one-facial-set) that my friends rave about but without the $110 price tag. \nDespite all my friends rave reviews, I couldn't justify spending $110 dollars on a treatment that includes FOUR applications that total to $27.5 Each. \n\nI impulsively bought it on Amazon for $19.98 dollars. It includes 8 treatments (thats $2.50 a treatment. heck yeaah dolla make me holla!) \n\nIt came to my house in two days  *thanks amazon prime/bae* (don't tell my bf) \n\nThe powder consists of nine organic ingredients including albumin, corn powder, aloe berry leafy extract and lavender oil, while the activator contains over 15 ingredients that work mainly on pore tightening and wrinkle care.\n\n\n**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**\n\n\nSkin1004's [website](http://www.skin1004indonesia.com/product/detail/skin1004-zombie-pack-8pack-brush) \nclaims that it is:  \n\nA 8-in-1 full-face TREATMENT MASK : in only 15 minutes, get a facial that\n1.

Panthenol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Glycerin, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Echinacea Angustifolia Extract. Commiphora Mukul Resin Extract*\n\n**COMMENTARY**\n\nThe ingredients really intrigued me, I liked how it contains Centella because my skin LOVES it for my redness. Ingredients like Centalla, Niacinamide and Aloe are pretty high up on the list. \n\nI know many people with sensitive skin can't do fragrance, but weirdly lavender oil has never really bugged my skin. \n\nThe package comes with 8 powder packets (attached together so you can break them off), 8 activator packets (in a sealed bag) and a brush. \n\nThe instructions are to pour the activator in the powder packet and mix it to a liquid consistency. \n\n\n**PRE MASKING :**\n\nMy skin: \n\nIt is almost winter in the midwest and my skin has been very dry, slightly dehydrated and red.  \nMy concerns are : \n\n- Visible pores around my nose \n\n- lots of redness and PIE from hormonal breakouts on my jawline and some of my cheeks. \n\n- forehead wrinkles ( I am 24, and I want to be preventative as well) \n\n- irritation: my skin HATES physical scrubs, clay masks etc \n\n\n**MASKING**\n\nI apply the whole mask over my face per what the directions. I applied a little bit more around my areas of concern (my nose and cheeks and jawline/chin) \n\nThe directions said to wait 15 minutes and leave the mask on for the long TOPS. \n\nI double cleansed my skin and applied the mast. \n\nThe mask kind of smelled like egg, but that didnt really bug me. It was drippy and I accidentally dripped some on my dog (sorry doggo) \n\nFirst few minutes, the mask was starting to dry, i felt no irritated. \n\n5 minutes later - HOLY CRAP my face started to feel tight. I could make NO expression. \n\n10 minutes later - it kind of started to itch a little but I told myself I would stick it for 5 more minutes (no pain no gain amirite?) \n\n15 minutes later - I looked in the mirror, crap. I looked scary. My bf said I looked like I was 88 years old. My face felt tight and frozen. I LOOKED LIKE A ZOMBIE OLD LADY\n\n**DIAGNOSING MY SKIN**\n\nThe website says areas that are bumpy are Areas that lack elasticity, and are prone to wrinkles.\nAreas that are cracked are areas that lack hydration \n\nI thought that I would have bumps on my forehead. But in all actuallity pretty much my whole face was cracked. (SMH -_-) \nThe only areas that were bumpy were my undereye area, temples and my smile lines.\n\nWhat does this tell me? That I need to load up on hydration more (drink a lot more water) and maybe get a better eyecream haha \n\n**DID MY SKIN LIKE IT?**\n\nI washed it off, my skin felt pretty tight. and it was a bit red but ohhh myyyy. My pores looked so much smaller and my skin looked a little bit brighter. \n\nI showered, continued on with my night routine and went to bed. \n\n\nWaking up, my skin looked super smooth, my pores were still small and there was little redness except for a few pimples I had on my jawline. I looked a lot brighter.\n\n\n**MY THOUGHTS**\n\nDo you want to scare your BF or significant other into thinking your age is actually 64 years older than you said. \n\nDo you want all your friends to laugh at a photo you sent them asking \"What is wrong with your face?\" \n\nDo you want your face to look pretty and smooth like an instagram filter the next day? \n\nDo you want to not spend $110 dollars on a Hanacure mask? \n\nIf you answered yes to one of those, this mask is for you! \n\nThe instructions say to do it 3 times a week. but I don't think my sensitive skin will be able to handle that so I will save it for special events or if I am bored and want to spook people. [mwahahaha](https://giphy.com/gifs/planning-happy-gif-evil-plan-14nNwczrhgaQ5G)\n\nOverall id give it a 4/5, I loved the price point, it was fun, and I would deff buy it again but I havent used it enough for HG status. \nI also really liked the brush it came with. \n\nWhere you can buy it :\n\n[Amazon]( https://www.amazon.com/Skin1004-Zombie-Pack-set-treatments/dp/B06XZV7ZGC/ref=sr_1_3_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1542723676&sr=1-3&keywords=skin1004%2Bzombie%2Bpack&th=1) for $19.87 USD \n\n[YessStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/skin-1004-zombie-pack-set-powder-2g-x-8pcs-activator-3-5ml-x-8pcs/info.html/pid.1066657689) for $15.16 USD - It is on sale right now! \n\nI will be posting this review on my Instagram as well: [@lafilledifficile_](https://www.instagram.com/lafilledifficile_/)\n\n\nEDIT : Opps pardon my research but someone last year reviewed the same mask, you can find that review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/6oxkff/review_skin1004_zombie_pack_korean_special_facial/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

The drying part is so uncomfortable, at minute 10 I‚Äôm ready to claw my face off. The part where there are bumpy parts and cracked parts are true, interesting to experience where those parts are, somewhat what I expected. \nBUT, your skin looks amazing after, I have dry acne prone skin and it does not irritate it from what I‚Äôve experienced. I wash my face first, apply, rinse off then use a cleansing toner after and apply a face oil before bed. Wake up and skin looks great. Almost as if life‚Äôs horrors haven‚Äôt aged me an extra 10 years.

I think the lavender may have also helped me stay more still during the MRI too as i can be a bit fidgety when nervous.\n\nAgain, just one personal experience but it seemed to help me with my mild to moderate nerves & associated symptoms.",

The analysis examined the effects of the oil (specifically Silexan, which is the active substance in the product Lasea) on subthreshold anxiety disorder.   \n\n\n> The researchers also found that Silexan was effective at reducing sleep disturbances caused by anxiety symptoms, and noted that, ‚Äú10 weeks' administration of Silexan led to a significantly more pronounced symptom reduction than placebo treatment.‚Äù \n\n  \nJournal Reference:\n\nEfficacy of Silexan in subthreshold anxiety: meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials\n\nM√∂ller, HJ., Volz, HP., Dienel, A. et al. \n\nEuropean Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience (2019) 269: 183. \n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-017-0852-4\n\nLink: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-017-0852-4\n\nAbstract\n\nSubthreshold psychiatric disorders do not fully meet the diagnostic criteria of syndromal disorders but may be associated with comparable disability. To investigate the anxiolytic effect of Silexan, an active substance from lavender oil for oral administration, in patients with subthreshold anxiety, a meta-analysis that included all published trials with Silexan in this indication was performed. Three randomised, placebo-controlled trials in subthreshold anxiety disorders (anxiety disorder not otherwise specified, restlessness and agitation, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder) were included. Eligible participants with a baseline Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) total score ‚â• 18 points received 1 √ó 80 mg/day Silexan or placebo for 10 weeks. Outcomes included the HAMA, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, the Clinical Global Impressions questionnaire and the SF-36 health status inventory. Data were analysed using meta-analysis based on pooled raw data of individual patients (random effects models). A total of 697 patients were assessed for efficacy. Silexan was superior to placebo in reducing the HAMA total score during 10 weeks‚Äô treatment [mean value difference, 95% confidence interval: 3.83 (1.28; 6.37) points]. Superiority was comparably pronounced for psychic and somatic anxiety as well as for observer- and self-rated anxiety. Silexan had a beneficial effect on sleep (secondary to the anxiolytic effect) without causing sedation and improved the patients‚Äô health-related quality of life. Adverse event incidence in both treatment groups was comparable [risk ratio: 1.06 (0.85; 1.33)]. Silexan has a significant and clinically meaningful anxiolytic effect in subthreshold anxiety. The results cannot be generalised to other lavender oil products.",

    "body": "And I‚Äôm proud of it. It‚Äôs just FB so furthermore not a big deal. I don‚Äôt know if this is the place to share this but I‚Äôm going to anyway. \n\nI moved to a new city when my son was 9 months old. When I came, I searched for moms groups and a ‚Äúnatural mommas‚Äù one was one of the first ones I came across. Moms posted in it actively, including things to do around town, recommendations, etc so it seemed beneficial for a new mom in a new town. The rules stated the mods were 50/50 on vaccinating (among other things) and I glossed over that, thinking all types of moms would be represented. I didn‚Äôt anticipate it being anti medicine/doctor. \n\nI‚Äôm into what is known as a ‚Äúcomplementary ‚Äú approach. I don‚Äôt see it referred to this often because any whiff of oils, or alternative methods often gets you branded as an anti vaxxer and the conversation takes a turn, but it‚Äôs different. I like essential oils, reiki, massage, and just plain ol home remedies; I find it really interesting. There is science to back up all these things as helpful, to an extent, depending on the circumstance and situation. Humans had to get creative before CVS. Also, when you have a little baby, you have to do alternative stuff; a sick 5 month old can‚Äôt take some NyQuil and call it a night. As much as we all fantasize. But when my kid is uncomfortable, I‚Äôll crack open a bottle of baby Advil so fast your head will spin. We need relief and sleep and if a humidifier and some lavender oil isn‚Äôt doing the job, I‚Äôm upping my game ASAP. \n\nThe amount of women in that group asking for literal medical advice from obvious non professionals was astounding. I was naive. The first time I got my wrist slapped was responding to a mom asking about her kids earache. She was clear they were in pain and methods she had been trying that obviously weren‚Äôt working. Women were posting about garlic and lavender and I suggested going back to the doctor + pain med. I was like you tried other stuff and it didn‚Äôt work so it‚Äôs time to draw the line. I still vividly remember the pain of frequent earaches from my own early childhood. Besides a few ‚Äúlikes‚Äù I was bombarded with anger that this was a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù moms group. \n\nEarlier today some idiot posted about her child‚Äôs flu and asking if based on symptoms and her almost 106 fever, could it have turned into pneumonia? I told her to trust her instincts and go to the ER; that regardless of anything else that‚Äôs too high for a little kid and she was obviously concerned or she wouldn‚Äôt be asking. She responded back with a little colorful infographic with literally not one medical fact about how fevers aren‚Äôt actually that bad until 108 and said that it‚Äôs not uncommon for her daughter when she gets the flu. And then I was blocked. \n\nI feel sorry for all these little kids and babies who can‚Äôt advocate for themselves. Mad at the parents who deny relief based on their own confessed fear of doctors or to support the rhetoric ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù natural, and just plain forgo common sense. I don‚Äôt get the bragging about not using medicine and the self righteousness that ‚Äúthey‚Äù know something ‚Äúwe‚Äù don‚Äôt. Make your kid feel better!",

But there's also times you'll get deathly ill and you need to get your ass to a Dr before you die. I always take a safer approach when it comes to my son than for myself, honestly. If I even wonder if he might need medical care I'll call his ped and talk about it, and most of the time the Dr says it's fine and some Tylenol will do the trick. I have no desire to let my son suffer. But I agree with you about the complementary approach. I studied herbal medicine for a little while and I fully believe it can be beneficial, but I would never, ever use it to replace Western medicine that I know is necessary. Like your example about the ear ache, I had a double ear infection and couldn't afford a Dr so I tried natural methods I found online and ended up with two bursted eardrums and now I can't hear very well. But if I have a cut or a sore throat, I'll treat that with some natural stuff first to see if it helps before I go see a Dr. I like to use some calming scents in my son's room at bedtime to help him relax, stuff of that nature. I think they can coexist as long as you're aware of drug interactions and don't shy away from medical help when necessary. I also think a lot of plants are better suited to be used as a prevention rather than a remedy, especially since once you're very sick, it's not that easy to fix that with plant remedies. It's much better to get a z pack and go to bed. It's like how kale is really good for you, but it's not going to fix you once you're dying, I use the same approach to plants. Oh yeah, and before anyone says it, I'm all about some vaccines. My son and I are all up to date. Lol.",

    "body": "**Sunscreens for Sensitive Skin at Low Price Point (with Photos!)**\n\nI promised a few weeks (months...) ago I would put together a mega collection of sunscreen reviews, and I'm finally ready! I've had a lot of fun trying new sunscreens this summer in the hunt for The Perfect One. \n\nI've been on retinoids (Differin, Adapalene 0.3%, then Tretinoin 0.025%) since March 2018, and have used SPF 50 every single day. I have desert-dry, sensitive skin with minor rosacea (subtype one) and PIE leftover from acne. All of these were applied over my morning moisturizers (FAB ultra repair cream, rosehip oil, sometimes Stratia LG).\n\nMy selection criteria are as follows:\n\n* Low Price Point (I aimed for under $15 per bottle, with two exceptions)\n\n* Easily Accessible (available via drugstores or major online venues, e.g. Amazon, Dokodemo, Yesstyle, Ebay)\n\n* Marketed for Sensitive Skin (this varies by brand)\n\n* At Least SPF 50 (generally regarded as \"good enough\" for most people, even Tret users)\n\n\n**MY METHOD**\n\nI work from home, so I have the luxury of not worrying about sunscreen or makeup in the morning. I cleanse and moisturize, then wait until later in the day to apply my sunscreen. I treated each sunscreen exactly the same: I measured out a half teaspoon, applied on every inch of my face (up to my hairline, down my neck and d√©colletage, around the back of my neck, on my ears, lips, and eyelids), then reapplied a little extra to the high points of my face. I don't want a sunscreen that I need to be fussy with or careful to keep out of my eye area. I want something cosmetically elegant that I can glob on everywhere and have it just work.\n\nMy dog and I go on our hour-long walk around 5pm every day, when it's cooler and the UV index is lower (under 5). We live in a hot, humid climate (American South) with temperatures up to 95 degrees and humidity above 50% almost every day. There's always a chance of rain in the summertime. I don't tend to sweat a lot, but my hair does get uproariously frizzy. \n\nI took each of the outdoor photos at the beginning of our walk, after the sunscreen had set but before it could degrade at all. The indoor photos were taken after we got back home and cooled off a bit for lighting comparison (bathroom lighting). I'm particularly interested in how these sunscreens wear, and whether they hold up to heat, sweat, and other environmental factors. Reapplication is part of life, but I also want a sunscreen that pulls its weight!\n\nIf a sunscreen did not work for me, I traded it over to Team Body Sunscreen or gave it away to a friend. I don't believe in waste, and sunscreen is still useful even if it doesn't agree with my face.\n\n[Group Photo of the Whole Squad Together!](https://imgur.com/a/4yr9RG7)\n\n**THE REVIEWS**\n\n**Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk Blue Bottle, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Nano Zinc Oxide, Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus\n\n* Japanese, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free\n\n* Moisturizing combination liquid sunscreen that contains hydrating ingredients (hyaluronic acid and collagen). It takes a few minutes to dry down and can get a bit messy/drippy, but it‚Äôs worth the effort. This sunscreen looks and feels better than any other I‚Äôve tried. I especially like that it cooperates when you apply multiple layers, and it plays nicely when I apply makeup on top. The pink bottle version contains alcohol and brightening ingredients, while the blue one is the better choice for sensitive skin (it's identical to the old gold bottle from 2018). I'm finishing up my tenth bottle and (sadly) do not plan to repurchase. After the streaky UV photos from a couple months ago on SCA, I have some doubts about the protection this product offers, so I'm going to stop using this as my everyday.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/wggel4L)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($14 for 40 mL) or Dokodemo ($13)\n\n\n**Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 50, PPD 19.2/PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Vegan, and Cruelty Free\n\n* Soft, creamy, clay-like mineral/physical sunscreen that dries to a powdery finish. Superpower level of mattifying on oily skin. It is slightly pink-tinted, and provides coverage comparable to a medium foundation (somewhere around Mac NW15 to NW25 if I had to guess). It dries down in 10 minutes, then it‚Äôs exercise- and water-resistant for 80 minutes. This one has serious staying power and usually takes a double cleanse (oil or micellar water followed by regular cleanser) to remove completely. It does dry out my lips (see the picture) and can be irritating on my undereye area, especially if I wasn't careful to layer my moisturizers beforehand. Best in this list for outdoor sports or hiking. This is my eighth bottle of this sunscreen, mainly becuase it's sold at my regular grocery store and it's an excellent shade match for my skin tone so I don't need to worry about blending it in.\n\n* I also have the UNTINTED version of this sunscreen, which I've been trying in desperation to use up for over a year. This is the ultimate sunscreen if you want ghost face. When I tried it the first time, my husband asked if I was wearing \"geisha makeup\" (he might have been joking, but my lord was the white cast bad). Try as I might, this does not work for body or face. It's real bad.\n\n* [Photos of the AG Tinted Here](https://imgur.com/a/fHjSGlM)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($11 for 89 mL), Walgreens/CVS ($13), or in grocery stores\n\n\n**Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul MC80, Tinosorb S\n\n* Japanese, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, and Cruelty Free (not Vegan!)\n\n* This combination sunscreen doubles as a makeup primer and makes you glow! It has a gel texture, is easy to spread around, and dries to a clear, dewy finish with zero white cast and a slightly tacky feel. I waited around a bit and the tackiness did go away after about half an hour. As a highlighter addict, I love that it makes me glow, and it lets me skip the primer step when I put on makeup. When I put makeup on top, it amplifies the colors and gives everything a nice shimmer to it. I usually use an illuminating primer as my base (Missha BB Boomer) but this more than takes its place. I've finished the first bottle, will definitely repurchase, and plan to give bottles to my sisters-in-law as birthday gifts. I only wish the little bottles were bigger!\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/DWwqBtP)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($9 for 40 mL) or Dokodemo ($8)\n\n\n**Amavara Tinted Transparent Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50 (PA/PPD unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Non-Nano Zinc Oxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Vegan, and Cruelty Free\n\n* Thick, non-greasy sunscreen with the texture of wet clay. This one is mainly included to give the Australian Gold tinted sunscreen a comparison point. It is slightly olive-tinted, while the Australian Gold is cool/pink toned. It dries to a matte finish, and can be slightly drying if you have dry skin. It is water-resistant for 80 minutes. There are several reviews from surfers on the Amazon page that vouch for its staying power. My mom originally bought this for herself, but the shade wasn't a good match for her so she gave it to me... even though we wear the same foundation shade. I'm giving this one away to an olive-toned friend.\n\n* Rather than wearing this on my face, I decided it would be more useful to do [swatches of the AG Untinted, AG Tinted, and this Amavara one](https://imgur.com/a/wE5PuPO)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon: $35 for 70 mL\n\n\n**Sonrei Sea Clearly Translucent Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 (PA/PPD unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Homosalate, Octocrylene, Octisalate, Avobenzone\n\n* American, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Paraben Free, Reef Safe, Vegan, Gluten Free (Contains Palm Oil as First Ingredient)\n\n* I'll be honest: I bought this when I was drunk. I was browsing Into the Gloss and found an article about [sunscreen for people who don't like sunscreen](https://intothegloss.com/2019/08/clear-sunscreen-gel/). I had never heard of this brand before, but the antioxidant-rich formula caught my eye. It contains Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid (the same combo in several top Vitamin C serums), albeit at the end of the ingredients list. If the antioxidants in this product are actually effective, it would be an EXCELLENT morning multitasker and would solve my problem of finding a Vit C product that I actually like using. I reached out to the customer service team to ask about the PA/PPD rating, and received [this email in response](https://imgur.com/a/YNDWOGY) in less than 12 hours. It seems like they're really dedicated to the efficacy of their products and if I decide to repurchase I'll definitely check back to see their new test results.\n\n* The texture of this sunscreen is unlike any of the others on this list. It's thick and difficult to squeeze out of the tube. Once it's out, it looks like apricot jam with texture that feels almost exactly like vaseline. As I worked it into my face it melted and broke down into a thick oil, not unlike olive oil. There was little scent, but it irritated my eyes anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it did indeed dry down completely clear, if a bit uneven, and the greasiness mostly went away. I've included photos of it freshly applied and 20 minutes later when it was dry for comparison. As I walked around outside and sweated, it started to run down my face -- not okay when the UV index is 7! I do not think this one is a good match for me, but I thought of an alternate use for it: It performs beautifully as a brow gel to tame my unruly eyebrows! With the huge bottle I'll have enough to last the rest of my life (or until it expires).\n\n* [Swatch + Photos Outside, Inside/Wet, and Inside/Dry](https://imgur.com/a/E4U7TD9)\n\n* Buy it on the Sonrei website: $25 for 3.4 oz\n\n\n**Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Uvinul A, Uvinul T 150\n\n* Korean, Fragrance Free, Alcohol Free, Vegan, Cruelty Free\n\n* 70% water base, hyaluronic acid, and four different types of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù essences, it works like a moisturizing, calming cream. The ‚Äúgreen‚Äù ingredients are derived from centella asiatica, a medicinal herb that hydrates, promotes wound healing, treats eczema/dermatitis, and reduces inflammation. There is another version of this product that contains essential oils and fragrance ‚Äì this unscented one is the \"safer\" version for sensitive skin. This one is frequently compared to the Dear Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence, which I did not include in this review because of the price. \n\n* I noticed a subtle green-correcting effect when I wore this; it helped to calm down redness and make it less noticeable. It's not as pronounced as the Dr Jart+ Tigergrass or Cica products (which are literally green-tinted), but I think it makes a difference. The finish is pearlescent (not shiny, just a nice healthy dewiness) and it works well under makeup. My skin was noticeably calmer, less red, and less reactive, even at the end of a full day of wear. This has become the sunscreen I reach for most often (even more than my beloved Skin Aqua milk!) and I've already repurchased two additional bottles.\n\n* [Photos From Three Days of Wear](https://imgur.com/a/iqwhPgL)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 60 mL), YesStyle ($14), or Jolse ($15)\n\n\n**Purito Comfy Water Sun Block, SPF 50+, PA++++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Non-Nano Zinc Oxide\n\n* Korean, Reef Safe, Alcohol Free, Silicone Free, Vegan, Cruelty Free (Contains Essential Oils)\n\n* This is the mineral version of the one directly above. I heard about it from [Gothamista's 2019 mineral sunscreen review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMbO5RyUkUI). The formula has 70% water, hyaluronic acid, and centella asiatica. That review described it as \"highly hydrating, soothing, and disappears immediately into the skin with a silk, skin-like finish.\" My experience was COMPLETELY different. This was hands-down the most disappointing sunscreen I tried. When I first squeezed it out of the tube, I was hit with strong fragrance. This has orange peel oil, tea tree oil, and lavender oil. It smelled like I walked into a Bath & Body Works aromatherapy sale circa 2008. Eyes watering, I attempted to apply it the usual way (rubbing it in) and found that it wasn't cooperating at all. I switched to patting, which was somehow even worse. It never sank into my skin; instead it balled up and got even drier. The more I worked on it, the worse it got. It was like trying to rub zinc diaper cream into my face. There was no way to achieve anything close to even coverage. I didn't even leave the bathroom, I had to wash it off right away!\n\n* In the interest of full disclosure, my experience runs contrary to every other review I read about this product -- everyone else seems to have no problem getting it to blend in and most describe the scent as \"subtle\" or \"refreshing.\" I ordered this and the Green Level sunscreens from the Purito storefront on Amazon, and received a handful of legit-looking Purito foil samples with my order. I don't think this is a fake, so I think it must be the result of a bad batch. Honestly, this was so disappointing that I'm not going to order the unscented version (newly released in August). If you want to try this out, definitely go for the unscented one!\n\n* [Indoor-Only Photos](https://imgur.com/a/xs51wgk)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 60 mL), YesStyle ($15), or Jolse ($15)\n\n\n**Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk, SPF 50+, PA+++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\n* Korean, Contains Alcohol\n\n* This physical sunscreen starts as a thick white cream, and the marketing says it dries clear with a matte finish. The alcohol evaporates quickly, making this sunscreen one of the fastest-drying (under a minute). It contains aloe and centella extract (soothing ingredients) to help balance the drying effect of the alcohol. I found that it tended to clump up on the baby hairs on my face and neck, and the white cast only increased as it settled on my face. In one picture I have a lovely white moustache and a streaky white neck, and in another photo there are visible white lines where it creased on my eyelids. In the \"indoor\" photo you can see how ghastly I looked after being outdoors for half an hour. After several hours of wear my skin was dry, red, and not happy. I struggled to use this up on my arms and legs because of the clumping and white cast, but eventually emptied the bottle. Will not repurchase.\n\n* [Photos Here from Two Separate Days](https://imgur.com/a/ILON6wK)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($10 for 55 mL) or Jolse ($12, shipping from Korea)\n\n\n**Missha All-Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel, SPF 50+, PA+++**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Homosalate, TEA-Salicylate, Escalol 517, Tinosorb S, Amiloxate, Octocrylene\n\n* Korean, Contains Alcohol\n\n* This chemical sunscreen is absolutely invisible on the skin, and you can even double or triple layer it without looking like a zombie. Water- and sweat- resistant, which makes it a good option for outdoor activities. The potential downside is the alcohol content (fifth ingredient) which supposedly evaporates upon application and helps it dry down more quickly, similar to the Etude House one above. This one was extremely irritating for me -- my PIE and rosacea flared up immediately, and the alcohol sting did not abate as I wore it. My skin felt tight and warm until I was able to wash it off. I used this exactly twice, and will not repurchase. I gave this bottle to my husband to keep in his work bag.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/L0IY2XQ)\n\n* Buy it on Amazon ($15 for 50 mL), YesStyle ($11), or Jolse ($13)\n\n\n**Walgreens Sensitive Skin Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 (PPD/PA unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Octocyrlene\n\n* American, Fragrance Free, Oil Free\n\n* This combo sunscreen is extremely cheap (it's a HUGE bottle) and free from oxybenzone and avobenzone -- but that's pretty much all it has going for it. It goes on chalk white, but with a little work it rubs in mostly clear but never dries down completely. My face was shiny and my eyes streaming from the burning feeling on my skin. The label claims it's water resistent for 80 minutes, but it started dissolving just minutes after I went outdoors and started to sweat. As it melted off my face, I looked greasier than ever. I'm also not convinced that the filters (5% zinc, 4% octocrylene) are high enough for this to be effective for us photosensitive folks. I've relegated this one to Team Body Sunscreen, and will not repurchase.\n\n* [Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/PDKutDh)\n\n* Buy it at Walgreens ($11 for 236 mL or 8 oz) in the U.S. I'm sure there's a CVS generic equivalent product as well.\n\n\n**Vanicream Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 (PPD/PA unknown)**\n\n* Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\n* American, Reef Safe, Alcohol Free, Fragrance Free, Lanolin Free, Paraben Free\n\n* When I first started my retinoid routine, my dermatologist told me to go to the drugstore and pick up Vanicream everything. It's her go-to brand for people with sensitive skin, and it's easy to see why. Vanicream is very concerned with avoiding \"harmful chemicals,\" so most of their ingredients lists are short and the products are no-frills. Like any all-mineral American sunscreen, it goes on chalk white and takes a good amount of elbow grease to work into my skin -- \"grease\" being the operative word. The white cast mostly went away, but I was still a little pallid a couple hours later. It leaves me slightly sticky/tacky until it dries completely (takes about 20 minutes) and after that happens it's bulletproof. It claims to be water-resistant for 80 minutes and it is absolutely correct: no amount of rain, tears, or chlorinated water can make this stuff budge. Like the Australian Gold one above, it takes a thorough two-step cleanse to remove at night, and balms/oils perform better than micellar water or makeup remover.\n\n* [Indoor Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/RuVdbYm) (I didn't make it outside that day!)\n\n* Buy it at Walgreens/CVS/Drugstores ($15 for 113 mL or 4 oz) or Amazon ($17)\n\n\n**TOP PICKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n**Best for Sensitive or Reactive Skin**: Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk Blue Bottle (combination) or Vanicream Sunscreen (mineral)\n\n**Best for Oily Skin**: Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen Lotion (mineral) or Missha All-Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel (chemical)\n\n**Best for Dry Skin**: Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun (chemical)\n\n**Best for Under Makeup**: Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV (combination)\n\nIf anyone wants additional swatches, comparisons, or whatever -- let me know! I've still got every single one of these in my bathroom waiting to be used up in one way or another. Also, if anyone spots an error or can fill in missing information (such as PA/PPD data) please let me know! I'm happy to edit this post to supplement my impressions.\n\nSide Note: I had to take a longish break in the middle of my testing because of an eczema outbreak on my left cheek and jaw. You can see it in a couple of the photos (kind of looks like a mosquito bite). I stopped all new products and went back to a bare-bones routine, then eventually had to use a mild steroid treatment to clear up the eczema. This doesn't usually happen outside of the winter months, but all's fair in love and skincare.",

I currently use the Australian Gold Tinted SPF and I'm getting to the end so thinking of repurchasing but I'm not 100% in love. I wear makeup overtop but not allover and as sheer as I can get away with as my acne improves.\n\nI'm also not really a fan of how thick and matte the Australian Gold is. I have oily skin but just don't really like the feeling of a thick and light layer. I've seen people say it's cosmetically elegant but I don't really feel like it is. Maybe it's just my preferences or maybe I'm applying a bit too much, not sure.\n\nAlso I'm vegan so I SO appreciate you listing vegan and CF as attributes. Do you have a source you could point me to for Canmake being vegan? Did you purposefully not list it as CF as well?

I‚Äôm using Anthelios SX right now which is really good as a moisturizer but only SPF 15. AB stuff always has so much better UVA protection too. \n\nAre there any others on this list or not that you find exceptionally moisturizing? Everyone loves the Purito Centella Green but Dr Dray brought up that it only has two UV filters so there might be some coverage gaps in the UV spectrum. Uvinul T 150 doesn‚Äôt block much above 330 nm and doesn‚Äôt block at all above 340 nm. Uvinul A Plus attenuates across the entire spectrum but does the best between 340 to 375 nm. The good thing is that they are both very stable but depending on the exact formulation there could be a small transmission peak around 330 nm. It‚Äôs probably very small though especially in the amounts of filters they would have to use to achieve PA++++ and SPF 50. I still trust it better than any mineral sunscreens or American sunscreens.",

I got no plum, no nothing really. Just sickening lavender.\n\nI decanted 5ml for a friends second opinion to see if they smelled the same, maybe my nose is broken for this scent - they did. Said it was cheap lavender air freshener. Disappointed. Back of the cabinet it goes.\n\nRoll forward a week, me assuming it was a dud buy (blind, of course as is the way) and I give it another sniff just to be sure.\n\nSure enough, sweet plum, the lavender has mellowed quite a bit and smells less sickly. I get the citrus open and the wood is coming through. It actually smells nice now.\n\nMaybe they bottle these knowing that the lavender oil they uses dies/settles down quickly when exposed to air, so they need to over-juice that note so that it doesn't vanish entirely 2 weeks after initial sprays? Again I have no idea.\n\nThe transformation is real - and I only hope it will get better with time as some of the more powerful forward scents die back a bit and let the others shine through.",

Once you spray, you get oxygen in... And then the maturing process can continue/start. \n\nWhat I usually do, so I won't waste too much juice, is flip the bottle upside down and spray the old Air out (spray about 20 times). That gets new air with oxygen to replace the older air that has no more oxygen. Then I spray 10-15 to have even more air with oxygen in the bottle... Then let it sit for a few weeks. If I like the scent on the first spray... Then I just use it from day one... It will mature either way. It will actually mature faster the more you use it (you get more air in).",

We can't deny the fact that oxygen has some kind of effect on a perfume that has different volatile elements in it, like talking from a chemistry standpoint. Now, it can either be good or bad for a perfume. Generally speaking, I'd say for most cases it is something good.\n\nThe reason why maturing works so well in most ME perfumes, their biggest problem is usually its their top notes (their most volatile elements), first things you smell when you spray it, it usually smells really synthetic and sometimes even disgusting, so because of this  new oxygen entering the bottle, it allows the most volatile elements interact with it inside the bottle, instead of getting all those volatile elements interacting with the environment and your skin.    \nThat's my point of view on the topic\n\nI had same experience with VR, but it was not for me even after letting it sit for a while, and  I also read a comment that it smells like \"your grandmother's house\". Could not wear it again lol. So sorry if I ruined it for you, but I already know my lesson of not paying attention to any bad comment on a fragrance I own. \n\nAnyways, good luck with it!

Classic perfumery allows the fragrance oils to settle together for weeks or months before bottling in order to give them time to blend.  Now with modern just in time manufacturing the expectation is that happens in the bottle. Big difference is exposure to oxygen. Oxygen can be powerfully corrosive (see rust) in the right circumstance. Whatever air is in flacon at bottling is static so the initial oxygen‚Äôs impact is limited, and introducing more with fresh sprays could be helping that blending to finish. \n\nIs this a little bro-sciency? Absolutely.  But it‚Äôs not without its logic, and it would explain a commonly observed phenomena. Also, the benefits of added maturation seem to scale inversely with the average retail price of a fragrance. Cheaper frags are rushed out quicker, before they‚Äôre finished cooking.  Letting the air-rot often helps.",

Well visit went well, I brought a living Orchid over a vase of flowers on suggestions here. Also brought hand cream, chapstick and a diffuser with lavender oil. Anyway we visited on Tuesday. He knew who we were, seemed happy we were there, likes the orchid and the nice smell. He couldn‚Äôt hold much of a conversation though. Wednesday he didn‚Äôt know who his wife of 40 years was. Thursday he didn‚Äôt wake at all and passed that night. Thanks for all the advice from here. Just being there and sharing stories seemed like the biggest gift we could give. Everyone is sad but are grateful we got to say everything we needed to before the end and that we could have the opportunity to prepare. I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt suffer long, he didn‚Äôt want that. The kids (who are 18/22) got to spend time with him before the end and are doing ok. Grandparents live 1:30hrs away from us. My step kids have been taking turns and staying overnight at grandmas. It‚Äôs all a lot but we are ok. Thanks for the advise I got here. I haven‚Äôt lost a family member since I was a little kid so dealing with it as an adult and a stepmom I was a bit lost but the advice here helped a lot.",

Uff da...‚Äù I puffed, pushing myself up off of the floor.\n\n‚ÄúTucked in tight?‚Äù \n\nMy favorite part. Teagan giggled as I playfully jostled her about, making sure her blanket was tucked extra snuggly all around her. ‚ÄúSnug as a bug in a rug! Check.‚Äù\n\nI kissed the tips of my fingers and pressed them into Teagan‚Äôs forehead. ‚ÄúAlighty, sweetheart. I think we‚Äôre all set. You sleep tight, ok?‚Äù\n\nWith her ‚Äúmagic blanket‚Äù pulled up over her nose, Teagan nodded, though her eyes still panned anxiously around the room. ‚ÄúGoodnight, sweetheart.‚Äù I said, slowly backing out the door. ‚ÄúSweet dreams.‚Äù\n\nJust as I took a step away, Teagan called out. ‚ÄúDaddy! DADDYYYY! You forgot the monster spray!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUhg. Monster spray‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered, but flipped on the dad magic as I playfully poked my head back into Teagan‚Äôs room. ‚ÄúThe monster spray! *How* could I forget the monster spray?!‚Äù \n\nThe monster spray was a repurposed Windex bottle full of water, lavender oil, and some fine multi-colored glitter. It was my wife‚Äôs idea. Something she had seen on some parenting blog when searching for remedies for Teagan‚Äôs sudden fear of monsters. Teagan loved it and I do think the lavender might actually help her sleep, but I *always* wound up with glitter on my hands and pajama bottoms, which then transferred onto my side of the sheets overnight. Some mornings it looked as though I‚Äôd had a roll around with Tinker Bell in my sleep.  \n\nWe kept the monster spray on top of Teagan‚Äôs dresser, which sat right next to her door, facing her bed. Above the dresser hung a mirror I had custom made for her with a pink rose frame leading up to a golden crown on top. ‚ÄúA princess mirror for your princess!‚Äù she‚Äôd exclaimed, when I presented it to her. \n\nI picked up the monster spray in a dramatic, triumphant fashion, and lifted my gaze to look into the mirror, expecting to see Teagan‚Äôs smiling face reflected back at me. Instead, standing just a foot behind me, separating me from Teagan, stood a tall dark figure. Red eyes peered at me above a wide, menacing grin. The teeth‚Ä¶ God, there were more teeth than I could count. \n\n‚ÄúJESUS CHRIST!‚Äù I hollered, spinning around, flinging the monster spray in my surprise. Nothing. There was nothing there. Teagan sat up in her bed, clutching Mr. Bear, eyes wide. ‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶‚Äù I started, ‚ÄúTeagan, did you see that?‚Äù\n\nShe nodded slowly, still trembling in fear. \n\n‚ÄúDid you see where it went?!‚Äù I asked, reaching for her t-ball bat by the door. \n\nShe nodded again, pulling her magic blanket up over her head. She whispered so quietly that I could hardly hear her through the blanket. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs behind you‚Ä¶‚Äù",

I‚Äôve been receiving notifications on Facebook for over a week now about this party, and to let her know ASAP who‚Äôs coming. I live right across the street from her so there was no escaping this. So the day has come and I just so happen to be high from the night before, so here I am documenting my experiences. \n\nI got here a little late because busy busy busy, but ugh I made it!!! I had a huge headache walking in but thank god they have diffusers everywhere because it really did make it go away. But it gets better! I got to rub some orange oil on my hand to help me be happy. Makes me wonder how I was ever happy before. Just as I dived into deep thought I accidentally knocked my bag down and all my day weed purchases fell out, so naturally I needed the lavender oil to help me get rid of all my stress. Man my  body really needed that because remember if your body doesn‚Äôt need it you‚Äôll hate the oil. \n\nI‚Äôm noticing that I‚Äôm a little more high than I think so I move to the kitchen cuz I‚Äôm starving. The pizza is freaking AMAZING!!!! I still have pretty good view though because I just cannot miss the video where it shows me how to get the oils for the least amount of money! Yay!! All I have to do is sign up to be a wellness advocate and purchase my oils for 25% less that retail price. But wait there‚Äôs more!!! The more PV I get higher chance I have to winning a free oil bottle!! If there‚Äôs anything I know is that with pyramid schemes there‚Äôs always talk about PV. So I move in for another slice of pizza to pretend like I did not just hear that. \n\nSo video is over and now everyone is talking. Something about how some oils support your DNA.... whatever that means. The wife is saying she makes her own mouth wash out of oils! Ok ew. You guys!!! If you sign up now you get a free book on oils! Omg! \n\nOh snap! The son has been hiding in his room this whole time! Oh ok... you were called in for a shift? You don‚Äôt have a license what??? You walk??? Do you need a ride??? No it‚Äôs not a problem at all!!! I‚Äôll take you to work!!! \n\nAlright soooo that was a fail. The grandparents are taking him now, so I have to go back inside. \n\nThe only reason I‚Äôm here is cuz of food, but jokes on me I guess. My friend just told me they put oils in everything they made. I‚Äôm just gonna sit here until I fall asleep now ",

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\nüåü **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\nüåü **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\nüåü **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\nüåü **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\nüåü **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\nüåü **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\nüåü **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\nüåü **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\nüåü **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\nüåü **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\nüåü  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\nüåü **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\nüåü **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\nüåü **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed! i'll also leave my current routine in the comments below, for those who may be interested. i hope this was of some help to y'all :-), and that all of you would have good health during this period!",

    "body": "I've been shaving my body from last 4-5 years. I'll mention what I follow :-\n\n(Do all this with **warm water.** Cold water would tighten your pores and won't give the comfortable finish)\n\n**LEGS ü¶µüèª -** \nFirstly, trim your hair using a electric body trimmer for a faster and easier shaving process. Rinse the hair and apply the shaving gel and create lather. Let it sit on for 30s to make the skin soft and hydrated. **DO NOT go against the grain on your thighs** ! I have done this in the past and it gives so much bumps and itchyness. Follow your natural hair growth and shave in that. Below the knees, you can go against the grain by just sliding the razor from up to down at first then down to up. \n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**BUTTOCKS üçë -** \nI don't like to use a trimmer to cut any excess hair as the skin over there might get agitated and create bumps later. Shaving procedure remains the same. The way I do it is I **stand in front of mirror and then shave by my instinct and then twist to see if everything's clear** (sounds funny lol because it isü•≤üòÇ).\n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**NEAR THE HOLE üç©-**\nVery sensitive area and you have to go much slowly and not overdo or repeat the strokes. **For this, I usually do this after I finish my shower, I lie on my back and then spread my legs (like missionary position) and get a clear look of the centre and then watch in the mirror as I shave**. Again, a bit hard to do but works well after some practice :)\n\n                               ---------------------------------\n\n**CHEST AND BELLYü§∞üèª -**\nUse a trimmer on dry skin and trim all your hair well and good till the base. I sometimes prefer this as it gets the job done of smoothening. But if opting for shaving, the process remains the same. But *you may get an itch or redness for 2-3 days after you shave* against the grain. **DON'T** itch it a lot or else it will worsen the skin.\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\n**ARMPITS AND DICKY üçÜ-** follow the same procedure as trimming longer hair, lathering and shaving with and then against the grain but very gently. This region also has very soft skin which may get irritated or cut fast so...make sure to take your time and lather enough! **Stretch the skin by your other hand to make the surface more uniformly planar for easier shave** :)\n\nThis is how I do and is probably the ideal way to go for shaving the crotch would be :-\n\n**For dicky üçÜ:** Get yourself **slightly erected (semi)** and then work your way up near the pubic region first by foaming with shaving cream/gel and lathering üßºüòÑ then slowly reach up the shaft and go along the grain. Once you're finished doing this, rinse the area thoroughly!\n\n**For balls üçí:** You don't necessarily need to be hard or semi. But you have to make sure that you lather and foam is much better and gently! Then **take smaller segments of the skin on your testicles and gently stretch it and then run the razor to make that area smooth** ü™íüòÑand then finish off the remaining! And be very gently and calm! Keep rinsing and applying the cream again and again as you will have to see how much is left üòÑand if you want, you can also go near to your perineum but it may be difficult to do so especially for a beginner so...better not for now! Apply an aftershave once you're done with this to prevent any infections in the area :)\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nGet yourself nice and cleansed in the shower but my recommendation would be **not use any strong bodywash or soaps the same day** as these consists of harsh sulphates and chemicals which may cause irritation to the shaved area. You can use some mild ones, if you have :)! I just **use a loofah sponge** and gently, under the warm shower, start swirling it around in circulation motion all over my body. This is called **exfoliation and is important to avoid bumpyness and dry dead skin left on the body** :) it *really* works!\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\nAfter the shower, **use a moisturizer with less fragrance and no parabens** preferably (I use **Calosoft and Hymos lotion** as suggested by my dermat). Drop **2-3 drops of Tea Tree Essential Oil** in your moisturiser to avoid any acne/buttne on your skin :) (this can be optional as tea tree oil might be strong for some skin)! Also, you can use some drops of **Lavender Oil** to have a better sleep later too üí§\n\n                              ---------------------------------\n\n**Optional pro-tip** : Your feet are as cute as your body :'D so make sure you prep the toes, nails and soles well. The same moisturiser works! But if you want the **skin to remain soft and supple, grab an ice cube üßä and slowly rub it before sleeping to increase circulation and make them pink and soft naturally! The same can be done for your face if you're suffering from acne!** *It works wonders for real* ü¶∂üèªüßèüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n                             ---------------------------------        \n**Optional pro-tip#2** : You may face from hyperpigmentation at times if you're someone like me who has more colored skin! I try to use **lemon and sugar** as my scrub which *1. Removes any dead skin and 2. Brightens up the skin for an even skin tone* :) it's a slow process though so results won't be very drastic üçã!\n\n                             ---------------------------------\n\n**Clean/change your bedsheet that particular day** as your bedsheet may have dirt or bacteria which might irritate or cause skin to get infected due to open pores after shaving.\n\n                             ---------------------------------\n\n**GETTING PRICKY INGROWN HAIR AND BUMPS?!üòû** Absolutely normal :) you gotta know the way to treat them well! This is what I do if it happens to me :-\n\n‚Ä¢ **Apply a cold compress** to suppress the area and eventually increase blood circulation due to cold temperature ; \n\n‚Ä¢ **Use Aloe Vera gel** directly extracted from the Aloe plant combined with the nectar/essence from my Agave plant and use it twice a day to soothe and calm the sensation ; \n\n‚Ä¢ **Sit in a warm bath** which will relax the area and eventually shrink the bumps or lessen them, especially if it also has some pus from a possible ingrown hair situation ; \n\n‚Ä¢ **Use a cream which consists hydrocortisone, witch hazel, aloe vera or benzoyl peroxide** to make the irritated area heal. You can get these creams on any dispensary or medical store.\n\nIf these still don't make the bumps go within a week or so, I prefer to make a visit to my dermatologist for medications :) this has never happened so far though!\n\n                           --------------------------------------\n\n**GOT A CUT WHILE SHAVINGü•∫üò±!?!**\nNo need to panic at all :) We've all been there! I've cut myself a few times and it's mostly either because I wasn't lathered and relaxed the skin enough or it was an area where I am not able to see clearly hence, my instincts go wrong :/ In such a case, **immediately stop shaving that area and just sit or have that area rinsed in cold shower. If you're bleeding, keep washing with cold water until bleeding stops. Finish your shower and gently apply an antiseptic in a cotton ball (ouchüò£but it's going to save youüòÑ)! And throw that particular blade and get a new one!** After that, make sure atleast for a day not to irritate or rub the area by anything! Small cuts heal in a day :)\n\n                            ---------------------------------\n\nHope this helps to you all‚ù§Ô∏è Any suggestions or questions from other people are most welcome in the comments :'D!",

    "body": "Hey guys. First time/long time. \n\nSo recently, my wife and I decided to open a small coffee shop in our quaint, historical town. Neither of us have ever truly owned a business; we‚Äôve pursued side hustles before (she actually did quite well for herself in wedding photography) but we‚Äôve never devoted ourselves to building something tangible from scratch like this before. It took a lot of sleepless nights and a lot of sacrifice and it‚Äôs still loads of work, but this has been a rewarding venture, both emotionally and financially. The business is still young, but we have cause for optimism that we have created something successful.\n\nWe‚Äôve made enough waves that people are sticking their hands out, as it turns out. People I haven‚Äôt heard from in a long time are clawing, like zombies, at my inbox. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you could really use essential oils in a venture like yours!‚Äù ‚ÄúWould you be interested in a new form of hemp oil to use in your shop for some fucking reason?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey long time no talk! Blah blah keto coffee blah blah!‚Äù Which is fine, I just ignore MLM messages at all times because idgaf I refuse to entertain them. (Although, I‚Äôll admit to being curious - do they think I‚Äôm rich now? Because if they think I‚Äôm rich they clearly haven‚Äôt seen the trash can death trap I generously refer to as a car. Or, you know, my credit score. But I digress.)\n\nSo this chick shows up in the shop the other day and she‚Äôs perky to the degree that I low key don‚Äôt trust her. Talks about how it‚Äôs her first time in, etc. We make gluten free and keto items and she‚Äôs telling me all sorts of ways to get the word out about them, expand our reach, blah blah blah. And then she drops it on me: ‚ÄúThis is from one business owner to another.‚Äù Okay, cool, I have no idea what she does yet. I‚Äôve learned in my short-ass time as a small business owner that most unsolicited advice is grating and/or stupid, but it‚Äôs harmless.\n\nSo she‚Äôs standing around, talking to me and sipping her latte while people filter in and out. She uses the line ‚Äúone business owner to another‚Äù a lot. She even engages with a couple of the sassier old ladies, saying stuff like ‚Äúoh my god, you should totally come hang out with me. I‚Äôm doing a girls night at [local performance space], you should come hang out!‚Äù Red flag, right, but whatever. \n\nFinally, she‚Äôs ready to roll. She tells me how everything was awesome and what a cute place and whatever. And then she leans in and drops her voice and says ‚Äúhey. One business owner to another. Can I put a flyer up for an event I‚Äôm hosting at [aforementioned local performance space]?‚Äù I tell her go for it, as the owner of that space is a good customer.\n\nAfter she leaves I go take a look at the flyer.\n\nFucking essential oils. It‚Äôs an 18+ essential oils party and ‚Äúlove clinic,‚Äù which I suppose everyone in attendance.... dumps lavender oil on their business, I guess? I have no fucking clue. I just know I let an MLM shill invade my business and harangue some customers after swatting them away like gnats on social media. \n\nAnd she did it under the guise of ‚Äúus small business owners gotta stick together‚Äù and I want to know how these people actually think they‚Äôre business owners. Is this what they tell them? Do other ones actually believe this? And is it weird that I‚Äôm... kind of offended?",

    "body": "**~Poesie~** This is THE literary perfume house! I also ordered their new Quill & Ink sample set (which they generously upsized for me!) and I look forward to trying more of those this autumn.  \n\n**Myself Invisible:** *Stacked books, spilled ink, black tea, shy violets hiding deep in the forest.* This was the very first book scent I ever tried and when I originally smelled this it reminded me a bit of baby wipes, perhaps from the violet/ink combo? After resting, and also developing more indie sniffing experience, it's still a sharp, inky floral while wet but with a complex paper twist and some tannic, woody black tea. It smells like a muted deep lavender and I like to wear it on rainy days--I've almost used up my sample and have a backup dram vial waiting in my collection! The violet, ink and paper combo reminds me of vintage lesbian love letters. 4/5 üìïüìïüìïüìï\n\n**Library Ghost:** *Studious marshmallows surrounded by books, ink, and polished wood.* This is tied for top two of my all time favorite perfumes and I'm on the verge of finishing my 5ml, which is a first! It smells like sweet, adult marshmallow with an indoor wood like mahogany, books/paper and the same ink note from Myself Invisible. Part of the reason I've almost finished my FS is that it's unfortunately faint and fades quickly so I plan to buy multiples when she eventually releases it in the EDP format. 5/5 üìñüìñüìñüìñüìñ\n\n**Opening Chapter:** *A generous cup of steaming Darjeeling tea, a rainy day, a pile of old books all your own.* In this one I can smell their lighter tea note, like in Twice to Tea, but it's less creamy sweet than that one and more herbal green, like wet crushed grass. I also smell a slightly musty warm vanilla from the paper--it strengthened over time but I do wish it were more overt. This might be a little too fresh and not quite distinct enough for me. I did really enjoy it mixed with Bibliophilia. 3/5 üìóüìóüìó\n\n**Book Fair** by Black Baccara: *Aroma palette is a woodsy atmospheric. Highlights include freshly printed book pages, ink, number 2 pencils, and a cool autumn breeze wafting through the window of a school library.* I do get an almost wintergreen mint smell while wet, but I think it's her autumn breeze accord (likely with a birch note) and her sharp, metallic ink note combining into a bracing, cool woodsy air vibe. That fades as it dries though and then it's allll first day of elementary school with cedar pencils, glossy fresh paper and something that smells like a gym floor. If you want straight up book smell there are better options but it's a great complex, nostalgic atmospheric. I plan to buy a dram vial when it goes permanent since I only wear it in fall but definitely need more than my tiny sample vial. 4/5 üìùüìùüìùüìù \n\n**~Sixteen92~** This was one of the first indie perfume houses I tried and I'm disappointed to give the disclaimer that because of their serious fulfillment problems I recommend buying from swaps instead of direct. Hopefully these impressions are helpful if you are looking, since they do make some of my favorite book smells.\n\n**Book of the Beast:** *Wet leaves, burned parchment, a roaring bonfire, inky night sky, a slice of leftover birthday cake.* I think of this more as my autumnal dead leaves perfume than a book perfume but the ink and parchment notes add a lot to this scent. When wet I get a dark, slightly smoky cake/leaf sweetness with dead leaves. Before resting it was heavy on the leaves but now all the notes blend together into a really nice vanilla-sweet, woodsy atmospheric.  The parchment makes the leaves smell papery and dry versus the sharp, green, dead leaves note from BPAL. The \"inky night sky\" smell actually reminded me of the ink note from Book Fair and, when directly compared, Book of the Beast is a less minty, more outdoorsy and warmer smelling perfume but they have surprising similarities! I have this one in an oil sample and travel EDP and can detect slight differences, but not much. 5/5 üìúüìúüìúüìúüìú \n\n**I Wanna Be an Airborne Ranger!:** *Breakfast cereal, melted marshmallow, strong coffee, library books, denim jacket, teen angst.* First this smells like coffee and rice cereal with a nice creaminess that's not too sweet. Next an atmospheric, musty paperiness and maybe a bit of denim come out to make it less sweet and more unisex. Strikes me as really cozy and a little breakfast-y but definitely creamy coffee forward. Barnes and Noble cafe realness. After a few hours it's coffee flavored rice krispie treats in a bookstore and very similar to Library Ghost! I look forward to layering that with Poesie's new Wakeful Ghost to try and dupe this for when my oil sample and travel EDP eventually run out. 5/5 üìîüìîüìîüìîüìî \n\n**Sick, Sad World:** *Dry breakfast cereal, steamed milk, used bookstore, crisp newspaper, wool jacket, knee-high black boots.* This is definitely the subtler \"vanilla\" version of Airborne Ranger's toasty \"caramel\" vibe. There's a sweetness at the beginning that almost reads as cherry or almond but in a good way; I don't get much leather. It definitely reads like cereal milk in a musty bookstore, very cozy and comforting--somebody compared it to the smell of wool. Glad I got it and it makes a great sleep scent. 4.5/5 üì∞üì∞üì∞üì∞üóûÔ∏è \n\n**Bad Reputation:** *Rolling paper, can**bis, cherry cola, worn leather jacket, torn magazine pages.* (I own this in a travel EDP.) My first impression is smooth cherry cola and light black leather, like a new purse. The paper notes lift, lighten and smooth the fruity cola and leather that could otherwise go really intense and dark but this scent definitely doesn't scream PAPER. Sadly I don't get too much cannabis in the EDP either. I do really like it though and it's my go-to complex yet light and girly leather perfume! 4/5 üóûÔ∏èüóûÔ∏èüóûÔ∏èüóûÔ∏è\n\n**~Death & Floral~** \n\n**The Library, Burning Down with Us:** *Burnt edges of books, the overpowering scent of gasoline wafting around the wooden banister, wax candles melting on a desk.* First impression is gasoline but wearable? There's a slight sweetness like new book pages. As it dries down I think I get the beeswax mixed with gas mostly, but it's hard to describe. Smells like the library was doused in gas and the beeswax candles are set out waiting to be lit but nothing's burning yet. Gets sweeter over time, like sweet smoke and paperbacks with a bit of woodiness/waxiness, but then settles back down. Would be really good to layer. I don't think I want to smell like wearable gasoline and beeswax but this is really trying to convince me otherwise... 4/5 üììüììüììüìì \n\n**Old Book Paper:** Such an interesting single note and I'm glad I picked up a sample. This baby is strong and only needs a tiny dot, it almost smells a bit burnt when I apply too much. I get the same pungent, slightly rubbery? scent as at the beginning of Bibliophilia, which I thought was leather (and perhaps could still be) but I'm thinking is the lignin/hexanal from deteriorating paper! It almost reminds me of the smell of a box of new shoes somehow. The intensity calms down as it dries into the skin and it gets smoother, dry and slightly more vanillic. Though I don't think I'll wear it as a perfume I'm totally going to try mixing it with some of these other scents and it's super helpful as a paper point of comparison! 3/5 üìúüìúüìú\n\n**Aziraphale** by Hexennacht: *Marshmallow-topped hot cocoa, rice, wool, cr√™pes, leather-bound antique books, and old, wooden bookcases.* This is slightly masculine cocoa, leather and wood while wet. I have to be careful to only apply a tiny dot or the leather and wood overpower the other notes with a sharp, almost tobacco smell that can get way too pungent. The rice and wool are subtle but cozy, the marshmallow/cocoa is just on the edges sweetening it a tad, cocoa is dark, dusty and accurate. This actually reminds me a lot of Sick Sad World (the rice and wool especially) and Airborne Ranger and could be a good replacement if you don't mind it being a lot darker and stronger. Not really my taste personally since I'm not quite butch enough to pull off more than the teensiest tap of it on my skin without it being overwhelming. 2/5 üìñüìñ\n\n**You Are Not Alone** by BPAL: *A dribble of lavender oil running along the cracked spine of a well-loved mass market paperback enveloped in a snuggly oversized hoodie.* WOW this is perfect, it's so cozy and comfy and subtly cool. This is my other top favorite perfume of all time. It's like a soft worn sweatshirt and dry warm paper and slightly sweet subtle lavender, perhaps some white musk too. In the bottle it smells like lavender dryer sheets but none of that sharpness lingers. I want to smell like this naturally. This conjures a very special scent memory and wears down to sugared lavender and skin musk. 5/5 perfection, I bought a backup üìÑüìÑüìÑüìÑüìÑ\n\n**Bibliophilia** by Nui Cobalt: *The love of Books. The vanillic scent of aging paper, the tang of fresh ink, venerable bookshelves of oak and mahogany, a sweet trace of pipe tobacco, an undercurrent of faded leather.* This smells like Library Ghost but with added leather/tobacco and no marshmallow, a.k.a a library! It's a true book-smell perfume--the leather/masculine notes blend well and take turns with the sweet, dry paper to take prominence. I can pick out the ink too. There are other (sweeter) paper blends I prefer more but this is great to add a book twist to other scents. Occasionally the opening is a bit pungent for me but I often wear it when I want to smell cool and androgynous, I've almost finished my sample and I keep the FS bottle by my bed so it's an obvious favorite! 5/5 üìïüìïüìïüìïüìï\n\n**Burn Book** by Deconstructing Eden: *College ruled notebook paper, cookie crumbs, indelible ink, glitter lip gloss, and an undercurrent of ruthless ambition.* This one smells like that slightly chemical book binding glue/ink scent with fresh notebook paper underneath. It's not sharp at all though, almost soft actually, with a very subtly fruity sweetness. My roommate thought it smelled like cognac! Blends almost too well into the skin, like a \"my skin but first day of middle school\" kinda perfume--juvenile but in a purposeful, artistic way. It's interesting and smells good but is a little too subtle and \"classy\" for me, it disappears almost instantly on my skin and I like it on my clothes but wish it were stronger and bolder. When I heard it was being discontinued I realized I'd used almost half my 5ml EDP in the couple months I'd had it, since I tend to reach for it whenever I'm in a hurry, want to smell \"cool,\" but all my other sprays feel too strong, so I ordered a 15ml and I foresee it getting used! It is pretty unique in my collection for how subtlely interesting that notebook paper smell is and I really like layering it with Book Fair for a first day of elementary school vibe. 4/5 üìíüìíüìíüìí\n\n**Paperback Cafe** by Stereoplasm: *Old books, Earl Grey latte, Japanese plum, ginger and creme br√ªl√©e.* At first I get the bright smell of tangerine zest, probably from the bergamot, plum and ginger, but with a creamy sweet complexity underneath. The zesty citrus is pretty overwhelming but once it has faded I mostly just get a slightly musty creaminess. Not enough books and too fruity for me but it smells pretty good. 3/5 üìôüìôüìô \n\n*PHEW* that was a lot. Other than the Quill & Ink collection I also have BPAL's **The Last Syllable** *(photos pinned to cool plaster walls, discarded papers, a web of strings, a mirror, a doll, singed straw, scattered books, and unfurled magnetic tape)* and NCD's  **Stories & Spidersilk** *(a scholarly variation on our beloved Starlight and Spidersilk. Slender strands of cotton flower hung with trembling dewdrops, cold crystalline musk, tiny black vanilla beans, aging leather-bound books, pipe tobacco, and towering wooden shelves)* coming my way. I'll probably just edit this post to include them once they arrive so I can keep my enormous collection reviews in one place!",

I was interested in Paperback Cafe, but your review of \"not enough books and too fruity\" means I can cross it off. I like fruity, but for that scent, I want the books and tea at the forefront.\n\nDeconstructing Eden's Burn Book sounds nice. Too bad it's been discontinued. If I see it in the swaps, I'll try it.

That night, I lit up candles of rose and lavender oil. I poured us both a glass of wine and we sat in our Jacuzzi, quiet and still with arms cocooned around each other. I sobbed and squeezed every sinew of her being. I needed to know ‚Äì palpably ‚Äì what Melanie Marshall felt like, one last time, before it all changed. \n\nToday I bring her breakfast in bed. Dried toast. An egg. A sprinkle of fruit and a cup of coffee. I land a soft kiss on the pale, pallid skin of her forehead, leave for half an hour to run errands and return to meet her retching and pouring her guts out into a bedside bucket. Everything remains untouched except for the coffee, half gone, and few lazy nibbles out of the toast. Nothing new. I spend the most part of the day affectionately mopping the pearly tears off her cheeks, and reading to her and repeating almost mechanically how much I still love her and why this isn‚Äôt all her fault. \n\nTomorrow, she will be stronger than I am. A whole lot stronger. It would take her elder brother Dave, myself and at least three other males to restrain her against a gurney and wheel her out to the clinic for weekly treatment. The clawing, the fighting, the maniacal screams that billow out of her chest whenever I talk about treatment. I know it‚Äôs coming. I‚Äôll remember to take her gag this time. Two weeks ago, my lapse of memory had cost a nurse at the clinic her thumb. \n\nI‚Äôve been thinking about the stats a lot lately. The docs have said that even with the best of treatments, only about 30% of all patients survive beyond two years. Folks have had a lot to say about me...about how I've been handling things of late. How cold I've become. How terribly heartless it is of me to snap and swear at my wife and force her to sit through all of these dreadful treatments. ‚ÄúTake her to a nursing home,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúJust let her die in peace,‚Äù they say. These ignorant fools don't know that my sweetheart Melanie died a year ago. I no longer see the love of my life in the hazy grey clouds that became her eyes. I no longer bear that heart-in-the gut kind of love I held for the woman I married. Death did us part, one year ago. God bless her soul. I just wish everyone would understand that my only objective now is to ensure that whatever ‚Äì thing ‚Äì snatched her mind and body is made to endure the slowest agony of chemical torture known to man...for as long as it lives. \n",

People say early sobriety and dealing with relapses during this time are the hardest parts of this journey... Here is all my advice based on experience: \n\n**DO:** \n\n\\-take a bath with epsom salts, magnesium, and lavender oil \n\n\\-Buy bone broth, or any kind of broth and drink hot cups of it\n\n\\-think of your favorite childhood comfort food... mine is lipton instant chicken soup (gross, I know)... I eat this and think back to moments when I was young and sick and eating this to heal \n\n\\-remind yourself \"this too shall pass\" -- inhale, say it aloud, exhale \n\n\\-light a candle, turn off the lights \n\n\\-breathe through the nose and out through the mouth--or do nose breathing only \n\n\\-wrap yourself up in a robe (my favorite one is from LL Bean: [Plush Robe](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/502982?originalProduct=123523&productId=1751987&attrValue_0=Bright%20Navy&pla1=0&mr%3AtrackingCode=C3312B38-E4D0-EA11-8109-00505694403D&mr%3AreferralID=NA&mr%3Adevice=c&mr%3AadType=plaonline&qs=3136941&gclid=CjwKCAiAxp-ABhALEiwAXm6Iycu98our07Pe_bu7sB4-QAQWqcDceNgpUK3ONgDvQV-SkPLGNi9AFBoCX98QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&SN=MasterPrompt04_test&SS=B&SN2=FindabilityRecs05_test&SS2=A&SN3=FindabilityProd07_Cat&SS3=B) )\n\n\\-say 'no' -- overextending yourself will wear your sobriety down... don't do it at this early of a phase... if you are going through withdrawals you need to say 'no' to anything except for healing (so you can say YES to better things that await you later on) \n\n\\-watch something mindless--I watch reality tv while browsing reddit. Anything that can distract you from the anxious and negative thoughts you might be having will do. \n\n\\-Buy Kava tea. Drink cups of warm Kava to settle you down and lift your mood. \n\n\\-Spray your sheets with a nighttime pillow spray. Lie down, put on the Headspace app, and breathe. \n\n\\-Turn on sobriety audiobooks--Quit Like a Woman, This Naked Mind, Untamed, Drinking: A Love Story are all great options. \n\n\\-Make a recovery Pinterest board. Find inspiring quotes and other sobriety tips and put them all in one place to remind you of why you don't want to drink. \n\n\\-Do yin or restorative yoga. Find free videos on youtube, or join [www.glo.com](https://www.glo.com) ) \n\nevery little thing you can do to care for yourself is worth it. care for yourself now so you can do great things later.",

So if you‚Äôre a longtime alcoholic, substituting kava will inhibit your liver from repairing itself. I would recommend Kratom tea or capsules instead. You can probably get it wherever you get your kava with less impact on your health. Kratom is a southeast Asian leaf that is ground in a powder. Can be made into tea, mixed into juice or water, or you can just eat the raw powder. It‚Äôs closely related to coffee, and while it doesn‚Äôt have caffeine, it has stimulant, sedative, and pain relief properties depending on the strain. Red strains are more relaxing and sedating. White strains are very stimulating and feel like a more euphoric cup of coffee. Greens are a nice in-between with a nice mood lift and alertness at lower doses, and becomes sedative at higher doses. I use a day or two a week and it has helped quit drinking. I find greens strains are nice during the work day for a mood/energy boost, while reds are nice to unwind in the evening. Whites are a little too stimulating for me, but then again I can‚Äôt even handle caffeine in small amounts. Anyway, it has been super helpful for me without the health risks of kava.",

    "body": "This is my first post ‚Äî on RedditüòÇ ‚Äî so bear with me. To start, from about October of 2015 to December of 2015, I suffered from 6 extreme nocturnal panic attacks. I would wake up in the middle of the night, typically about 2 hours after I had fallen asleep, and would be having an all-out panic attack. More specifically, I would be in complete and utter fear of being on the verge of insanity/death and would eventually vomit. Some of the worst parts were that I was half asleep, I would not know what had triggered the panic attack, and I was in complete darkness. However, after much personal research, I came up with a hefty yet effective solution ‚Äî a nightly routine. Before I begin, I should also mention that in the past, I would wake up anywhere from 3-7 times a night but would quickly fall back to sleep. Therefore, after my 6th and final nocturnal panic attack, I researched how to stay asleep and how to calm my anxious and panic-provoking mind down before bed. I will now go in-depth about my routine:\n\nI begin by plugging in my phone thirty minutes before bed. A study done by the National Center for Biotechnology information found that \"frequent use of cell phones around bedtime is associated with repeated awakenings\" ‚Äî I want to stay asleep to help prevent these nocturnal attacks, not wake up. The artificial light emitted from your cellphone simply convinces your body's internal clock that it is daytime, resulting in repeated awakenings. I should also quickly mention that I try not to sleep next to my phone; I plug it in across the room to prevent myself from mindlessly waking up and checking social media, texts, etc. Anyways, the next step in my routine is to stretch. I myself have found that stretching before bed unknowingly relaxes me. Next, I layout my clothes. Then, I continue my routine by inhaling lavender essential oils ‚Äî an oil that induces sleep. This essential oil proves to be much more natural than sleep-inducing substances such as NyQuil or Benadryl (I will attach a link at the bottom with more information about lavender oil). Next, I lay in bed and read a book until I naturally get sleepy. Finally, I turn on an app known as 'Rain' and listen to exactly that ‚Äî rain. This may sound strange to some, but rain is a good example of white noise. White noise \"creates a masking effect, blocking out those sudden changes that awaken light sleepers.\" However, it's important to note that this doesn't include falling asleep to the television or fast-paced music! Anyways, this concludes my current routine that I still practice today. All in all, this basic routine that I have explored above enacts a powerful inner effect on my mind and body that it is time to sleep, and STAY asleep.\n\nHowever, in the very beginning of my self-treatment, I had a much longer routine (simply because I was much more fearful in the beginning).  I will now mention some additional habits I once had that helped me in the very beginning of my suffering. In the past I would consume a sleep-inducing mixture of 8 ounces of warm milk, 2 teaspoons of honey, and 1/8 teaspoon of ground nutmeg (I will provide a link to this mixed drink below that has more information about each ingredient and its effects on the brain). Also, before bed, I would occasionally jog for 30-45 minutes when I faced unusual sums of fear that night. This exercise would completely exhaust my body so much that it would not have the energy to flip on my \"flight or fight mode\" switch and would help to keep me at rest for the whole night. However, it is important to note that these extreme practices became unnecessary at a certain point in time ‚Äî they were simply my extreme solutions to the overwhelming fear I faced in the very beginning of my struggle. Overtime, due to my diminishing fears and the fact that I hadn't had a panic attack in so long, I slowly began to let go of these practices each night. \n\nI am proud to say that after starting the entirety of this routine I have not had ONE nocturnal panic attack since. I hope this post finds its way to any individual suffering from nocturnal panic attacks or even a curious reader :).

After therapy and meds and self help apps, I did get better. However, COVID pandemic messed it up and now I feel like I'm back at square one. Even worse, I'm waking up every night for the past month at exactly 2:27am and don't fall back to sleep until 4:30am. Everything I learned on managing my anxiety is only helping a little bit. My calm app and PMR (PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION) don't help much anymore. I wish I can sleep again all night like before. I agree that lavender does help. But in my case, it's not helping anymore. Tried stretches and yoga but nothing. It's 3:32am as I'm writing this and yup, still up feeling like an impending doom is happening. Writing this does help tho so that's a plus! So I understand all that you guys are going through and wish I knew how to help all of us. I wish even more there was a definite cure for this BS. I hope you all get better soon and can manage these awful crappy feelings.",

I am up all night and I go to bed when the sun comes up which causes me to not have a good sleep pattern that have me waking up every two hrs. I been drinking a lot of caffeine and no water. I have not been excersing at all. But I woke up after sleeping and hour, heart pounding, dry mouth for a brief moment, sweating, and the thought I was dying or something bad was happening to me. I got clammy, and cold, my stomach starts to hurt. I kinda start to feel that surge of a heat flash coming and feeling so off. I tried standing and I felt light headed. I finally had to breath and watch something on my phone to calm myself. I felt like nothing would help me and I wanted to scream for help or begg someone to take me to the ER. But I was so afraid to fall back asleep. I eventually did and I didn't have another one till two weeks later. And of course, no sleep, sleeping schedule way off, lots caffeine, and very stressed out over life and struggles. I came on here and read these and I kinda came to the conclusion they are maybe nocturnal panic attacks. Cause I don't feel these during the day. I do have a history of them since I was a child. And I've learned there are different kinds of panic attacks . I hate this kind. I'd rather have the shakes and feeling my throat is closed, then waking up feeling like I'm dying with all these physical symptoms. Sorry so long.",

I was getting like 2 hours of sleep a night and was actively hallucinating and vomitig/diarrhea from sleeplessness.\n\nWhat cured them, or at least is actively curing them, for me:\n\n1. Prozac, 20mg, once a day\n\n2. Ativan, .5mg, taken nightly the first four weeks of taking Prozac to break the brain-body connection my idiotic brain decided to form between sleeping/going into my bedroom and panic, and while the Prozac built up to its full efficacy. No problem tapering them back off, no crazy reddit-lies list of insane \"evil benzo\" side effects. I use them as needed now. Ignore anyone who tries to give you a single drop of grief about needing benzos, per my very, very well educated psychiatrist\n\n3. Carvedilol, 3.25 mg once daily, a beta blocker. Blocks excess adrenaline from affecting the heart (screw you brain, can't get anxious if I can't receive the signals :D)\n\nLiterally nothing else worked. No amount of CBT tools from my past experiences with GAD, no amount of distracting, nothing. Unfortunately, my body is DETERMINED to dump cortisone and adrenaline at 10pm, and only medications can make it stop. Now why is it doing that? Who knows. I ran out of money for doctors lol, that's my next goal to figure out. \n\nThere's hope. See your PCP, they can start you on the right mess. Shit gets better. Good luck.",

I sit up, calm down, and try again.\n\nI've found two pharmaceutical interventions that help: 1) Half a Xanax, which you don't want to take more than once or twice in a blue moon. It just vaporizes the urges that rise up from my brain stem and trigger panic attacks. 2) Piracetam, which is generally not prescribed in the U.S. but is available as a supplement, seems to also suppress the panic impulses. I take three 00-size pills before bed if I've had an episode recently, and always sleep through the night.\n\nSpending time with family before bed, or reading a book, instead of locked into devices or social media, might also help. But I am generally not an anxious or stressed person.  Nocturnal panic attacks are a physiological phenomenon, as far as I'm concerned.  They just happen and it's difficult to prevent through behavior alone. I've done sleep studies and have no apnea. It's just a weird quirk of the nervous system, it seems.",

I'm a dog groomer, and we have a YL Hun that brings in her yorkie for grooming. He's an absolute psycho for his nails and pawpads. She also only brings him in every 5-ish months, so he's never going to get better for it. After his first groom, we told her how he acted (in nicer words than \"psycho\") and suggested she bring him in every couple weeks for nail trims so he can get used to the process and eventually settle down. \n\nShe didn't do that. Instead, the next time he came in, she handed him off to me since he was my groom that day, pulled out a bottle and doused his feet in undiluted lavender essential oil to \"keep him calm.\"  I assumed the breathing problems and burning in my lungs and throat were because it was so strong. Unfortunately, my boss believes in essential oils and that they cure most things, so I couldn't tell her not to do it again or that it was very bad for the dog. Instead, I just took him straight to the tub and washed that crap off with dawn dishsoap the moment she was out the door. (I was able to get away with that by saying it was too strong and giving me a headache, which wasn't a lie. And that kind of oil is incredibly bad for our equipment so I couldn't do any kind of pre-work on him with it still on and very wet.) Unsurprisingly, it didn't keep him calm. He was still psycho for his feet, and I told the owner that when she asked at pick up.\n\nFast forward to this afternoon. One of my coworkers had him today. She's also an EO enthusiast. This time, the Hun had put the oil on him at home so it could soak in before his groom. So instead of washing him immediately, my coworker puts him on the table and starts doing the normal pre-bath stuff. She gets to his nails, and of course he starts acting up. So she needs help holding him. I put my dog down in a playpen and go over to hold the yorkie so she can get his nails done. (Important note here... we almost exclusively dremel nails. It's safer. You're less likely to quick the dog and traumatize it. However, it does create a lot of nail dust in the process.) While the smell wasn't nearly as strong this time, I almost immediately notice that my nose starts burning. And then my throat, and my lungs. And I couldn't breathe properly. And it set in quickly enough that my coworker was barely through just the back feet before she stopped to ask if I was about to pass out. I ended up having to leave the building to be able to breathe. And stayed out there until she had that dog washed and her area vacuumed.\n\nMy boss told the Hun what happened when she came to pick up the dog and asked her not to put it on the dog before grooms anymore. And I will never, ever forget what she said. \"Oh, you can't be allergic to it. It's Young Living. It's a pure essential oil. You must be asthmatic. It was just detoxing your lungs.\" I'm not asthmatic in any way. I rarely ever get any respiratory illnesses. Thankfully, I was on my last dog for the day, because I still wasn't breathing quite right. I immediately took some benadryl when I got home. \n\nTLDR - Hun puts lavender oil on her dog to \"keep it calm.\" Doesn't keep it calm and turns out, I'm allergic to lavender. Hun claims I can't be allergic and the oil was just \"detoxing my lungs\" which is why I couldn't breathe.",

    "body": "Hi all - I see a lot of people on here who have decided not to have any visitors for the first week/month/etc after baby is born, and I just wanted to add my experience to the conversation!\n\nI come from a country where extended families are pretty hands-on with babies, but I now live in a country where that‚Äôs not as much the case (to my mind at least). Having adapted somewhat to the customs of my new homeland, I initially wanted a week or two of just me and husband and baby - I envisioned lying in bed with my LO breastfeeding and Netflix-bingeing while my husband brought me sushi and oysters and champagne. But the day before my due date, suddenly feeling completely overwhelmed with everything I still had to do before baby arrived (we‚Äôd just moved house) I called up my mother and asked her to come stay with us for a bit. Right after I put down the phone, my water broke! My mum booked a flight immediately and was in our flat 36 hours later. It ended up being very lucky that she was there because I had a long and complicated labour and we were in the hospital for longer than expected. She was able to feed the cats, sign for a few deliveries we were waiting on, and generally keep the flat warm for us while we were away.\n\nThe day we came home, she‚Äôd arranged some lovely flowers in the living room and cooked a stew. It was honestly pretty nice not to have to make decisions about food and to have someone else running the household for a while. She stayed with us for a good two weeks and I was so grateful to have her there! I had mild PPD and was feeling generally out of my depth as a new mum and I needed a fair amount of mothering myself - she helped me and my husband balance the baby workload so that I could get some time to myself to lie down in bed and rest, which is something I probably wouldn‚Äôt have allowed myself to do if she hasn‚Äôt been there to encourage it. She cooked for us most nights but also gave me space when I said I wanted to do some cooking myself. She didn‚Äôt complain when I woke her at 3 am because I was worried I‚Äôd accidentally gotten lavender oil in the baby‚Äôs mouth. Most of all, she gave me real confidence in my ability as a mother - she never questioned our decisions and always told me I was doing such a great job. \n\nBy the end of her time with us, husband and I felt ready and excited for some time alone with baby. In the subsequent weeks, we also had visits from my father and my husband‚Äôs family. I found it helpful to have these distractions - days with a small baby can be very long and repetitive so it was nice to have visitors around to change things up! Weirdly, I looked forward to hosting guests - it gave me a sense of normality and I surprised myself with how much I was able to do! It made me feel like myself again.\n\nAnd most unexpectedly, I found that having people come to visit actually HELPED me bond with baby. I got to see other people holding her and interacting with her and it made her seem more‚Ä¶real? if that makes sense? It‚Äôs hard to explain. I think if there were other people in the house ALL the time I might struggle to bond, but a combination of time alone and time with others seems to be really working for us.\n\nThis is in no way to say that people who want to stay in a sweet little love-bubble with baby and have no guests at all are wrong!!! Honestly that sounds so lush and in an alternate universe that‚Äôs very possibly what we would have done too. I really value my time with baby and husband when there‚Äôs nobody else here. And I am very lucky to have such a great family and such great in-laws that I love and get along well with, which makes their visits so pleasant. But like I said, I just wanted to throw in my tuppenceworth and share an example of how having people in the house post-birth CAN sometimes go really well. At the end of the day, there‚Äôs no right or wrong and we‚Äôre all just trying to figure out what is best for us on our exciting parenthood voyage!\n\nAnyone here planning on having family/friends come to visit right after the birth?",

Which leaves me to rest and recuperate. With their help, i can afford to have visitors over without needing to clean the house, prepare drinks, entertain them. Much so that i can even disappear into my room and nap without a care of what‚Äôs happening outside.\n\nBut i must say it‚Äôs only because i have such a reliable support system that i could do this stress-free.",

During the birth my mom was a huge help in advocating for me and my needs while my husband focused on just being there and comforting me. When we got home the next day my dad had cleaned the whole house (even the shower lol) and had lunch ready for us. We spent the first few days just vegging on the couch and would take turns holding baby while the others napped! They both helped give little bits of advice here and there but nothing that felt overbearing and honestly most if not all was extremely helpful and I really appreciated it! After a few days I felt comfortable leaving the house so we did some sightseeing around the country before they had to go home. Once they left my husband and I felt comfortable being alone and we started getting the hang of being parents! \n\nThey will be flying in again, though this time they‚Äôre allowed lol, for this next baby and we‚Äôre all super excited for it!

    "body": "Are you looking for a spooky/eerie one-shot, to run this Halloween? Well. I have something interesting for you. This is not your usual one shot, and is designed to push your players into experiencing a story in ways they (hopefully) won‚Äôt have done previously. The techniques employed in this adventure are actually straight from the repertoire of magicians, mentalists, and s√©ance workers...\n\nNow, I know this is VERY late (being posted on Halloween itself...), but I really hope that this adventure is something completely different to anything you will have run before. Included is a *brand new* demonic foe for your players, as well as a couple of fun new features and techniques you can employ in your games. Find the full adventure [here](https://osrynnsoddments.blogspot.com/2020/10/halloween.html), on my blog, with maps, statblocks, and more. The adventure is as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***A Little Background***\n\nOutside of being a DM, I have a few other interests. Until **The Event‚Ñ¢**, I was working as a full time, professional magician (and magic teacher). Unfortunately, the virus put that career path on hold (don‚Äôt feel bad for me though, I‚Äôm now working in a great place, and really enjoying myself). That doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt still perform, and it certainly doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not still thinking of new ways to put my skills to use. For a long while, I have wanted to combine my love of D&D and my love of performing magic together in a meaningful way (card tricks don‚Äôt really fit in the setting, I find).\n\nIn this adventure, I will be teaching you (fellow DM) a couple of techniques to create a truly magical atmosphere at your sessions, as well as giving you a fully written horror/Halloween themed adventure to employ them in. The techniques taught here have been around for a long time, with one dating back to s√©ance workers in the 1800‚Äôs, and should bring an incredible element of mystery/unease to the table.\n\n***The Techniques***\n\nThe first technique I will be teaching you is a very old idea. It is believed that ‚Äòmediums‚Äô in the 1800‚Äôs used it in seances to trick their audiences into believing they were possessing of some otherworldly power. Simply put, it is a way of producing a scent for your players to smell, without your hands ever leaving their sight. Mediums would often produce the scent of lavender (or other similar flower) whilst sat around with hands linked, when trying to communicate with the spirit of an elderly female relative. Most of the time, the audience would associate the scent with their dearly deceased grandmother, and immediately believe her ‚Äúpresence‚Äù to be in the room with them.\n\nIn actuality, it was achieved by keeping a lavender oil soaked tissue/cloth in the mediums shoe. Simply by slipping the shoe off their foot (using their other foot), the scent would subtly begin to fill the room. The audience would not generally notice this, until instructed to ‚Äútake a deep breath‚Äù (or similar), and would suddenly remember something related to their relative (be it a perfume, potpourri, or whatever). The technique employed here is very similar. To achieve the effect, you will need some scented essential oil, a pair of slip on shoes, and some tissue paper. I will discuss the scents when we come to that in the adventure.\n\nThe second technique I will teach is a little harder to just describe. It might be easier to just demonstrate it right here. I will ask you all a simple question, for which I would like you to think of the first answer that comes to mind. ***‚ÄúImagine you are running down the road at night. Look up to the sky; what is the weather doing?‚Äù***\n\nIt may seem like a stupid question, and the more you think about it, the more likely you are to notice that it is worded rather oddly. That doesn‚Äôt matter! Your players won‚Äôt get a chance to look at it, or even really think all that hard at all, as you‚Äôll be asking them a lot of questions. You probably answered ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining‚Äù, correct? Either that or something to do with a storm. Roughly 90-95% of people will give that answer. That is the point! By asking leading questions, and by having multiple outs (stormy, raining, spitting, and a bunch more answers I can‚Äôt be bothered to list) you can almost guarantee your players giving you the answer you want. Add in asking 8-10 questions along these lines, you‚Äôll probably get at least 60% of the answers you want/need.¬†\n\nI perform a piece in a number of my shows (especially in the lead up to Halloween) using this principle. The spectator holds a torn page from a book in their hands, without looking, and I guide them through describing the scene described on it. The important thing to remember is to emphasise the things they get right, and simply forget about the things they don‚Äôt give the ‚Äòright‚Äô answer to. Don‚Äôt mention them, and they‚Äôll forget them too!\n\nIncluded is a script, designed to guide your players through describing a scene, which will play an integral role in the adventure. The process will use both of the techniques described above, and will (if used correctly) guarantee you a game your players will never forget.\n\n***Requirements for Play***\n\nUnfortunately, for the scent production (as well as a few other of the ideas suggested as possible techniques) in this adventure, you will need to be running an in-person game. The guided storytelling experience should work completely fine no matter how you play (in person/online/whatever), but I would suggest writing up a physical copy of the diary entry further on, and actively mailing it to each of your players. This way, they can‚Äôt accuse you of editing the text within, to match their answers.\n\nDue to these restrictions, I will be writing this adventure with the expectation that it will be being played in person, and that you will all be sat at a table together for the duration.\n\nTo ‚Äòperform‚Äô this session (to run the adventure) you will need a few things; a bottle of smoke scent oil (I usually use a ‚Äòwoodsmoke‚Äô scent), a candle (preferably red), a pair of slip on shoes, a prop to ‚Äòbelong‚Äô to a deceased character (will make suggestions later on), a printed/handwritten copy of the diary entry later on, and a stereo system.\n\n***Setting the Scene***\n\nBefore your players arrive for the session (or whilst you are setting up in whatever venue you are playing in), you will want to do a few things to set the scene. The first would be dimming any lights in the room. The second would be to set two pieces of music to play simultaneously. The first track should be something low and creepy. When I run games such as this, I use a selection of tracks from Incompetech (they have a very comprehensive library, and they‚Äôre free), just search on there for ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù or ‚Äúunnerving‚Äù tracks. There are hundreds.\n\nThe second track should be a single frequency note, sustained for as long as possible. You want to use an 18.98 hz. Frequency, played at a high volume. As long as you are using good speakers, they players (and yourself) should not be able to hear this frequency. It should be played all the way throughout your session, and never mentioned. The frequency is too low for humans to hear, but so close to our perception that it causes an uneasy feeling in people when they ‚Äúhear‚Äù it. There are a lot of articles out there on it, written by people far more knowledgeable than myself, and I thoroughly recommend giving them a read, as the science behind it is fascinating.\n\n***The Premise***\n\nWhether or not you want to run this as a one-shot, or if you want to write it into a larger/ongoing campaign, is entirely up to you. The majority of this one is not combat based, so should not prove to be a problem for players of any level (though I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for parties below level 3, or above level 10). Now we have the boring stuff out of the way, we can talk about the rest.\n\nThe party comes to a new town along their travels, one they are unfamiliar with, looking for work. The townsfolk seem agitated and anxious, especially around the party. Almost no-one even seems to want to make eye contact with them, and when asked about work, they will all just shrug, and suggest checking at the tavern. If they decide to listen for rumours in the town at all, they will hear a lot of talk about a couple, Elizabeth and Richard, and about something repeating.\n\nWhen they reach the tavern, the building will be almost empty when they enter, save for an older woman working behind the bar. She will look tired, and as if she had been crying recently. When asked about any leads, or any possible work in the area (or even about her mental state/current situation), she will explain about her daughter/son-in-law.\n\n***The Bartenders Story***\n\nThe bartender and tavern owner, Hellena, will tell the party of the troubles affecting her town. She will explain that, just under two months ago, the body of a young man, John, was found mutilated in his house. His wife, Samantha, was nowhere to be found, and the people were torn; some believing her to be responsible for his death, and fleeing afterwards, and others believing her to have been another victim of what/whoever killed John.\n\nPeople continued to debate the fate of Samantha, until two weeks later, when the same thing happened to another young couple. A local baker, Robert, was found in his home, in almost the exact same fashion as John two weeks prior. Again, his wife Amanda, was missing. People tried to find a connection between the two, but could not besides the fact that they were local couples, without children.\n\nPeople were starting to worry that whatever was responsible for the two prior deaths/disappearances would strike again, and their fears were proved right when, two weeks later again, another young couple were targeted in the same way. Hellena‚Äôs daughter, Elizabeth, and son-in-law Richard, became the third couple to be chosen. When She heard the new that there had been another murder, Hellena hurried straight to the house, where she found her son-in-law‚Äôs body lying on the floor, his flesh torn from his body, and his blood having been used to paint the walls, and Elizabeth nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe people of the town have grown quickly sullen, awaiting the next murders, hoping that they will simply stop, and leave the town free. Hellena will explain that the last scene was discovered 13 days ago, and that the town is aware that, should there be another, it will happen tonight. She will also explain that, given that the party are new faces in town, no-one is likely to trust them much, especially this close to another potential murder.\n\nShe will beg them to help her, promising to pay them whatever she can, as well as providing them free lodging, if they can find out what happened to her daughter. She will inform the party of another person whose help she has enlisted, a medium and spiritualist, ***Madame Kostana***, who they can find in one of the upstairs rooms. She will ask them if they would be willing to take part in a ritual to try and contact Elizabeth.\n\n***The Medium***\n\nWhen they head upstairs to meet her, ***Madame Kostana*** will be sat at a table, littered with cards, a crystal ball, candles and a collection of personal effects. She will agree to help the party (and Hellena) in their investigation, but will need one of them to volunteer to aid her in her ritual. She will ask the party to sit down around a table (definitely describe it to look like the one you are all sat around, if you are playing in person), with the volunteer sitting at the head. She will light a candle (I suggest doing the same in person), and hand over something belonging to Elizabeth (actually give them something to hold, a hairbrush, a locket, a ring, anything) to her volunteer, and instruct them to hold it close to their heart and close their eyes.\n\n*‚ÄúI would like you to hold this close to your heart, and close your eyes. We will be attempting to communicate with the spirit of Elizabeth, whether or not she is still on this mortal plane. Please, breathe deeply, and allow her to guide your words, while I ask my questions. I want to go back to the day you disappeared. Tell me Elizabeth, look up to the sky and tell me, what is the weather doing?‚Äù*\n\nAt this point, your player will hopefully have just said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs stormy‚Äù, or similar. If they do, then **amazing**, that‚Äôs hit number one. If they do not, this is not the end of the world. You can play off the first failure as being a bad connection between the two spirits. Either ask another player to take this place if you think the player is being difficult on purpose (or if they are trying to be funny), or simply tell them *‚ÄúI do not remember it being as such, but perhaps this is an issue of your two spirits connecting poorly. Let us try again.‚Äù* and have them perform some form of breathing exercise, and move on to the next section of script.\n\n*‚ÄúElizabeth, I can see movement ahead of you, what did you see move?‚Äù* obviously here you are hoping they will say either a cat or a dog (but any small animal will still be a partial hit, just make sure you respond with *‚Äúso you see a small animal?‚Äù*). *‚ÄúInteresting. Please, I know that you went home, tell me, as you stand outside of your door, what colour is it?‚Äù* White or Red are the only real answers that will work here, but no matter what, continue in the hopes of a minimum 50% hit rate. *‚ÄúStep inside and tell me, what do you see?‚Äù* This is a great one to guarantee a hit. There are three possible options that are a perfect hit, and over 90% of people seem to give these three answers; Stairs, Coats/Coat Rack and Hallway.\n\nAt this point, remove your shoe, allowing the scent oil inside to begin to fill the room.\n\n*‚ÄúI know what you must have seen next, and I shan‚Äôt ask you to relive that. But please, I can sense a large presence in the room with you. You can see a man? Or a woman, in the room with you?‚Äù* This is a great loaded question. You literally say **‚ÄúYou can see a man‚Äù** but then work it as if it‚Äôs a question. With the right wording, this will turn a 50/50 choice into a near 100% guarantee. *‚ÄúWhat is he/are they wearing?‚Äù* really, this is probably the least likely question to get a hit. If your player mentions a hat or coat, then amazing, but if not, make sure you bring no more attention to this.\n\n*‚ÄúBreath in deeply, and tell me. What can you smell in the room with you?‚Äù* As you say this part, make sure to demonstrate by breathing in through your nose. If done correctly, your player will 100% smell the smoke scent in the room for real, and answer that. For an even better guaranteed hit rate, however, maybe consider soaking a small amount of scent oil into the object your player is holding.\n\nDefinitely put your shoe back on now.\n\n*‚ÄúI can sense you want to run. Please, leave your house, and tell me where you go. Do you turn left out of your door, or right?‚Äù* I actually cannot explain this one. Maybe it‚Äôs because people prefer to pick the first option provided, or maybe we‚Äôre hardwired to always pick left, but over 80% of people will answer left here. Weird, huh? *‚ÄúWhat was that? I saw a flash of light and then nothing else! Elizabeth, what was that? No. She‚Äôs gone again. Tell me <player>, that flash, what colour was it?‚Äù* The final chance here, you can only hope they say Red. Oddly, about 65% of people do, thankfully. If this is wrong, however, you can play it off later as Elizabeth sending a message to ***Madame Kostana***, rather than a direct description of the event.\n\n*‚ÄúA <colour they named> flash, you say? That could only be‚Ä¶‚Äù* she fades off, and quickly hurries out of the room. The party can hear her rummaging around, and she comes back in holding a large tome. She places it down on the table, and explains to the party that the entity they are dealing with is an extra dimensional being that feeds on fear, and delights in bloodshed. As she rummages through the pages, the party will not be able to decipher any information in the book, it all being in a language they are unfamiliar with. She will find a page containing a table of sorts, and she will look at it, suddenly going wide eyed.¬†\n\n*‚ÄúHe* ***will*** *attack again tonight. There may already have been a death, but if you are quick, you might be able to prevent a second.‚Äù* She will pour over a map, drawing three circles over the areas of the past victims homes, and suddenly draw a fourth. This one in a different area of the town, but clearly forming a fourth point in what might be a pentagram. She will give them directions to the area, and tell them to keep their eyes open whilst there.\n\n*If you really want to have a higher chance of getting hits on the two colour questions, then I would recommend using a red candle for the seance section, as well as possibly using some red items as decor around the room. Keep it subtle though, if it‚Äôs obvious, they will actually avoid picking it.*\n\n***The Scene of the Crime***\n\nWhen the party approaches the street described, it will be quite obvious which house they should investigate. The quiet row of houses will be shrouded by the darkness of the night, mostly with lights/fires dimmed for the evening. One house will still have all of its lights on, and will have its door hanging open. As the party gets closer, they will notice a spray of blood coming from inside, onto the pavement at their feet.\n\nThe door, opened inwards (the same colour as the flash of light they mentioned earlier), is covered in blood, with what appear to be human entrails hanging over the top, in a crude mimicry of bunting. The stench of death will come from inside, as well as rotting flesh and fresh blood. The lights inside are dim, and from where they are, the party will not be able to see anything inside besides more blood.\n\nBefore they get a chance to enter, they will hear a scream from behind them (maybe actually scream when you say that? Depends on whether or not you want to go for a jumpscare here - I personally wouldn‚Äôt, but I prefer psychological horror over jumpscares). They will see a young woman running towards the house, with tears streaming down her face. She will notice the party, and quickly stop running, going pale as she does so. She will see the party as being responsible for the murders, but can be convinced otherwise if the party catches up to her (she will run away immediately, have them make a Strength (athletics) check, DC 14, to catch her up), and explain the situation to her. To do so, they will need to make a Charisma (persuasion) check, DC 15, which can be made at advantage if they roleplay well.\n\nEither way, she will refuse to enter the house, and will allow the party to continue their investigation. When they enter, they will notice the body of a man, dead, on the floor. The corpse will be laid out on the floor, completely out-stretched, with a gaping hole in its stomach. A number of organs and other internal structures will be laid out around it carelessly, and some will have tiny maggot-like creatures crawling inside them (rot grubs). As the players investigate, they will notice the tongue has been ripped from his throat, and is hanging over the fireplace, almost like a Christmas stocking. If they choose to investigate inside the mouth, they will find a small colony of spiders crawling out of his throat, and covering his face.\n\nAfter they finish investigating the body, they will be interrupted by a voice inside their heads, talking to them telepathically. *‚ÄúWell. You‚Äôre not who I was hoping for.‚Äù* it will begin, speaking in a guttural and low voice. *‚ÄúYou spoiled all of my fun. Not that it matters. Your screams will be just as delightful while my babies eat you from the inside out.‚Äù* As the party hear this last bit, the corpse‚Äôs mouth will open up, and a large stream of maggots, rot grubs, spiders and other insects pour out, piling on the ground in front of the party. Slowly rising up, and making the figure of a large man (roughly 8 ft. tall), shrouded by a long coat, and a wide brimmed hat. No features are visible beyond these, but the flesh underneath the coat seems to be writhing.\n\n*‚ÄúThis is the part where I suggest you run.‚Äù*\n\nIf the party attempts to attack or damage the creature in front of them, the creature in front of them will simply move its body around the attacks. If they attempt to slash at it, the blade will just pass through the body, with the creatures making it‚Äôs bulk up parting around it. Any damaged creatures will simply grow back, and multiply from the remaining grubs.\n\nIf the party continues to attempt to fight the creature, it will melt into a puddle of its constituent creatures, which will regain any autonomy they normally have, either crawling, flying or scuttling away from the party. The voice will return; *‚ÄúYou are more interesting than I thought. Maybe I should meet you myself!‚Äù*.\n\nIf the party decide to run, have the creature follow them, but describe how unnaturally it moves, leaving a trail of maggots and other creatures behind it with every step. Have it taunt them, *‚ÄúThis is brilliant!‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh, I wouldn‚Äôt have gone this way‚Ä¶ Such a shame‚Ä¶‚Äù,* and other things like that.\n\nRegardless of whether they run or stay, the next thing they will all see is a flash of red light, engulfing them.\n\n***The New Place***\n\nWhen the light fades, the party will find themselves in another unfamiliar location. All around them will be tall brick walls, covered in rotting materials and flesh, that seem to stretch up as far as the eyes can see, leading up to a black, starless sky. The entire area is in dim light, and if the players investigate the walls, they will notice that some of the bricks are actually squirming masses of maggots and rot grubs.\n\nThe room they will find themselves in will be square, with only one exit to the north. Laying on the floor in front of them is the decaying, rotting corpse of a young woman. The body will be face down, with her dress torn and partially rotted in places, a wisdom (perception) check, DC 12, will reveal a small amount of squirming underneath her skin. If a player gets too close, a swarm of rot grubs living inside her body will emerge and attempt to attack any living thing nearby.\n\n***The Map***\n\nThis is where you can finally use a map for the ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù pocket dimension that the players are currently in. The map, as follows, is quite small, and only consists of a few rooms and corridors. The main idea of this adventure, however, is not to be a large dungeon crawl, or a slog-fest battle heavy game.\n\n***H1: Elizabeth‚Äôs Final Rest***\n\nThe players will begin in this area, having been transported from wherever they were before. In front of where they start, the corpse of Elizabeth will be lying on the ground (as described above). Lying on the ground next to her, just centimeters from her outstretched hand, is a torn page from some kind of notebook. Should the party read it, they will find ***Elizabeth‚Äôs Letter*** (below).¬†\n\nThe room itself is relatively unremarkable, unless the party looks closely. There is only one way into/out of it, to the north, which seems to lead down a dark, seemingly pulsating corridor. If the party examines the walls of the chamber, they will find the bricks to be made out of living matter. Each brick is made of lightly pulsing flesh, filled with rot grubs, maggots and more, with a faint heartbeat being able to be felt throughout the entire dungeon.\n\nThe exit to the north of this chamber leads the party to a fork, with the northern path leading to ***H2***, and the eastern path leading to ***H3***. The walls of the corridor are made of the same material as the first area, still pulsating, and as the players pass through it, the sound of the heartbeat will grow louder.\n\n***H2: Web Pit***\n\nLooking into ***H2***, the party will see a stairway leading down 5 feet, and seemingly meeting with a floor made up of nothing but web. To the eastern side of the chamber, another, identical stairway leads back up and out of the room. Inside this room, the pulsating walls are still visible, albeit behind a veil of webbing coating all surfaces available. Any creature that comes into contact with the webbing must succeed a DC 12 Strength save, or become restrained (as per the ***Giant Spider*** (basic rules - p136) web rules).\n\nAny creature that touches the webbing on the floor of this room will fall straight through it, falling 10 ft. into a pit below. The pit is 10 ft. below the level that both stairways end, and sheer on all sides. To climb up, a creature must spend one whole turn climbing, and succeed a DC 14 dexterity (acrobatics) check. A player attempting to jump from one set of stairs to the other will need to first pass a DC 15 acrobatics check, or also fall into the pit.\n\nInside the pit are 3 ***Giant Spiders*** and 4 ***Swarms of Spiders*** (basic rules - p391). Any creature (other than a spider) entering the pit will become the target of the spiders inside, which will attempt to first restrain the party, and then quickly kill and eat them.¬†\n\nThere are two exits to this room, one to the east, and one to the south. Each of them are only accessible by climbing out of the pit (as described above), and each leads to a corridor. The eastern passage leads the party to a fork, to both ***H3*** and ***H4***, whilst the southern exit leads back to the turning to ***H1*** and ***H3***.\n\n***H3: Sea of Grubs***\n\nAs the players get closer to the chamber, they will notice that the floor itself seems to be alive. A wisdom (perception) check (DC 11) will reveal that the floor is covered with maggots and rot grubs. No matter how well they roll, they won‚Äôt be able to tell how deep the layer of grubs are. If they roll perception, any roll above a 16 will reveal the presence of something large moving around underneath the layer of grubs.\n\nThis room contains a 3 ft. deep pool of rot grubs/maggots, and 3 ***Giant Rot Grubs***. Any player wading in the ‚Äúpool‚Äù will have to make a DC 13 Constitution save upon first entering (and at the end of any turns they spend inside), or be subjected to the effects of a ***Bites*** attack from the ***Swarm of Rot Grubs*** statblock. Wading through this pool is considered difficult terrain, and as such, reduces player movement by half. Any creature that enters the pool, except a ***rot grub***, will become the target of the ***Giant Rot Grubs***, which will attempt to kill the intruders to provide food for the swarms..\n\nNo matter how much damage is dealt to the pool, the rot grubs and maggots seem to keep coming from somewhere below, as they continually multiply to fill in any gaps created through magical (or other) means.\n\nThis area has two separate exits; one to the west, and one to the north. The western exit leads the players back to the fork, and to ***H1*** and ***H2***. The Northern pathway leads them to another T junction, where turning left will take them to ***H2***, and turning right will lead them to ***H4***. The walls down both corridors are still pulsing with signs of life, and as the party heads down them, the heartbeats seem to be becoming louder/more frequent.\n\n***H4: Mouther Den***\n\nInside the next chamber, the party will see 3 hulking mounds of what appear to be liquid flesh. Coming from each of these creatures, they will be able to hear an incoherent babbling sound, that only gets louder as they approach. These three ***Gibbering Mouthers*** (basic rules - p314) will only attack creatures that attempt to move through their room towards ***H5***. After beginning to attack a creature, however, the ***Mouther*** will not relent, and will continue to attack it, even to the point of pursuing it out of the room.\n\nThis room has to exits, one to the north, and the other to the south. The northern exit leads the party back to ***H2*** and ***H3***, whilst the southern exit leads to the ***Azan‚Äôeth‚Äôs Lair (H5)***. The walls leading to the south become more slick with blood and viscera, and the pulsing becomes uneven (with there seemingly being multiple pulses in the walls, each at a different pace).\n\n***H5: Anaz‚Äôeth‚Äôs Lair***\n\nAfter a long passageway, the party will find themselves in a large, open room. On the floor, in the centre of the room, the party will see a small cluster of maggots. As they enter the room, the cluster will seemingly grow, bubbling up from a small crack in the floor below. The shape will eventually form the figure from before (complete with coat and hat). The figure will laugh at the party, and congratulate them on making it to him. It will tell them how much it enjoyed watching them struggle against <whatever they fought>. After quickly talking, it was tell them it has had it‚Äôs fun, and is now hungry, and will attack.\n\n***Lair Actions:*** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Azan‚Äôeth takes a lair action, using its control over its domain to cause one of the following effects; the Azan‚Äôeth can‚Äôt use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n* ***Summon Swarms:*** 4 swarms of CR ¬Ω or lower (rats, spiders, rot grubs, etc.) seep through small cracks that form in the walls/floor in any available space (including that of another creature) and each roll their own initiative.\n* ***Revolting Healing:*** The Azan‚Äôeth calls any number of swarms in the room with it towards it, and absorbs them, adding their health to its own as temporary hit-points.\n* ***Dissonant Voice:*** A mouth opens up on a brick in the wall, and calls out. Each player must make a Wisdom save (DC 14) or believe it to be the voice of a loved one crying out for help. Any creature that fails this save becomes distracted until the end of their next turn, and must make all attacks at disadvantage.\n\nAfter the party finally emerges victorious, the ***Azan‚Äôeth*** will melt into the floor, dissolving into nothing but a pile of maggots, grubs, and spiders. All around them, the walls of the room they are in will begin to dissolve in a similar manner, bubbling and melting around them, and begin to steam. When the air clears, the party will find themselves standing in the same place they were in before they were teleported away, surrounded by the bodies of 3 women, half rotted and covered in grubs.\n\n***Epilogue***\n\nThe party can return to Hellena and tell her of the overall fate of her daughter. If they provide her with ***Elizabeth‚Äôs Letter***, she will thank them, and offer them payment (of your choice). There are so many horror clich√©s you could play on at this point.\n\nShould they want to return to the scene of their return, you could have one of the bodies be missing, with nothing but a trail of damp footprints and dead grubs heading out of the town. Imagine their worries when they discover there could be a sequel! (they‚Äôre usually terrible, after all.)\n\nDo you want to leave them with lingering worries? Why not have all of the food in their packs become rotten, and infested with maggots and other grubs? Describe the scent of rancid rood, and let them discover the lasting effects of their journey. Do these grubs have any connection to the ***Azan‚Äôeth***? Probably not. But it‚Äôll be a fun ending.\n\nHave fun, and play with this in whatever way you want, and I REALLY hope you get something out of this‚Ä¶ interesting‚Ä¶ adventure.\n\n***Elizabeth‚Äôs Letter***\n\n*‚ÄúAs I ran down the street, the rain pouring down on me, something moved out of the corner of my eye. Normally a cat or dog (for I know not which it was) would not capture my interest, but for some reason, the way it moved seemed almost unnatural. I took it as an ill omen, and returned on my way home, hoping I wasn‚Äôt too late. When I reached our door, however, I knew I was.*¬†\n\n*The white door, now stained red, hung open like a beast's maw, daring me to enter. Knowing full well what I would find when I entered, but unable to pull myself away, I took a step into the dark building. The sights were familiar, and yet I took them in anew. The stairs up to our bedrooms no longer seemed inviting, the coats on the racks silhouetted against the wall like strangers, and the hallway into the rest of the house loomed ahead of me, taunting me, goading me to walk on. As I walked further into the house, each step taking me closer to the inevitable, my heart pounded. I stood in the doorway, looking down upon Richard's body. It didn‚Äôt seem real at the time. I kept telling myself it had to be some kind of sick joke. That he would simply stand up and laugh at my naivety. Even telling myself that, however, I knew that the scene before me was real.*\n\n*I don‚Äôt know what I had intended to do when I reached him, but I felt the compulsion to approach his lifeless body. As I grew nearer, I became aware of another presence in the room with me. The first sign was his breath down my neck. The second was the immediate scent of smoke that filled my lungs. As I turned to run past him, I could only make out the barest of features. The way he towered over me, bathed in darkness, the way his hat came out to cover and shadow his whole face, and the way that his long coat draped down to the floor, without even the barest piece of flesh visible. I‚Äôm certain that I heard him laugh as he saw the fear in my eyes.*\n\n*I ran out of the house, turning left down the street as I ran, I could hear footsteps following. There was a flash of light behind me, the entire world seemingly bathed in red light, as the sky turned dark.*\n\n*I know not where I now am, and I fear that I will not survive here long, but I write this in the hopes that someone reads my words, and helps put an end to this horrible cycle. Please, dear reader, find Him. Find Him, and end this. There is only one piece of advice I can offer. As he has chased me through these walls, the only thing I have seen to cause him to retreat has been light. I am nearly out of fire lighting supplies, and there seems to be no natural light in this place, so I can only hope this helps you more than it has me.*\n\n*I fear I have only been delaying the inevitable. I hope Richard and I can be together in the next life.*\n\n*Elizabeth‚Äù*",

    "body": " In every little slice of suburbia, quietly tucked away in those ‚Äúcute neighborhoods‚Äù referenced in the real estate pamphlets, there is always THAT house. You know the one. The ‚Äúshit show.‚Äù\n\nWelcome to Saddle Downs. At one time the best neighborhood in town, but now amongst the perfectly manicured lawns and driveways with nary a spot of oil leakage, an unholy abomination that looks like an episode of Hoarders made sweet love to Fred Sanford‚Äôs bread and butter elicits sighs and dramatic eye rolling from all who reside here. They wonder out loud ‚Äúhow someone who can afford to buy here could live in that kind of mess. *Of all the damned nerve!‚Äù*\n\nStanding in the driveway--garden hose in hand and meticulously rinsing my yard tools, I surveyed my crab grass outbreak with disdain and BOILED under the surface about what he‚Äôs done to this once beautiful collection of domiciles. I know the property values here have completely gone to shit. How could they not? And it‚Äôs ME who has to live DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET from him.\n\nThe trash. The junk. The 1989 Geo Metro with no hood. The kiddie pool full of slime and frogs. FFS, he has *three VCR‚Äôs* stacked beside the mailbox. Yes‚Ä¶I said VCR‚Äôs\n\nAnd is it so damned hard to cut your grass on Tuesdays like the rest of us?? I want to try the new edger I picked up during a July 4th sale (40 volt, top of the line), but as of right now I haven‚Äôt even seen the point. My yard will look like shit no matter what, because of HIM.\n\nThe neighborhood association won‚Äôt help. If it‚Äôs anything other than potholes or barbeques, they have a ‚Äúhands off‚Äù approach to governance. I plan to run for president in the spring.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶I could feel my blood pressure going through the roof that night, and the plant-based diet I switched to wasn‚Äôt doing shit to help bring it down. Something HAD to be done about him‚Ä¶\n\nLadies and gentlemen, meet Allen.\n\nMid 50‚Äôs, twice married and twice divorced, he works as an I.T. contractor for the state. Being stuck at home because of Covid, I hadn‚Äôt seen him outside in months. Who needs to go outside when you have GrubHub and your lawn mower is lying next to the house in 100 pieces? He had made a perfect hermit‚Äôs life, intrinsically safe from those of us who only asked for a little bit of respect for the neighborhood. \n\nSo, imagine my surprise when at 6pm last Friday evening, he suddenly stumbles out the front door, down the steps, and begins cleaning up his yard. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing. I was so stunned that I forgot the hose was still on until it soaked my favorite pair of Duluth Trading khakis. \n\nI blinked a few times to confirm what I was seeing. Allen was actually cleaning!\n\nI quickly gathered my tools and hung them in their outlined spots on the pegboard my wife, Karen, got me for Father‚Äôs Day. Her essential oils business has really taken off lately and she‚Äôs starting to spoil me. It‚Äôs amazing what people will do for some of her concoctions. She‚Äôs got proven ***anecdotal evidence*** of the efficacy of her blends. She‚Äôs healed everything from spider bites to yeast infections with those little bottles of miracle juice. \n\nI practically sprinted into the house to let her know what Allen was up to. Making sure to sit by the window the rest of the evening, I continued to peek out at my new favorite neighbor during commercial breaks in the Sean Hannity show. I wanted so very badly to go talk to him about it, but I was terrified that interrupting his task would jinx my good fortune.\n\nWhen I went to bed around 9:30, Allen was still hard at it and showed no signs of slowing. \n\nThe next morning at 6:15 I heard the familiar beeps that signal a large vehicle moving in reverse. I nearly fell over trying to slip into my Crocs to get to the porch and have a look. A massive flatbed truck was dropping a 30 foot long dumpster in the yard. Allen was really getting serious!\n\nI couldn‚Äôt take it any longer. I had planned to spend the day applying epoxy to my garage floor, but it was Allen‚Äôs project I was truly excited about now. \n\nI *had* to go over there. \n\nQuickly putting on some work quality clothes, I calmly made my way down the driveway and across the street. The yard was already looking better, but it really did have a long way to go. Allen was working like a madman. \n\nHe‚Äôs about 5‚Äô6 and half as wide as he is tall. What remained of his light brown hair was shaggy and unkempt, and he always wore the same outfit; dark gray suit pants, worn out loafers, and one of those silky, short sleeve dress shirts with vertical stripes that were popular in the early 1980‚Äôs. \n\nDespite the less than ideal attire for the task at hand, Allen was working his ass off‚Ä¶and so would I. It was clear that absolutely nothing in the yard would escape the dumpster‚Äôs insatiable appetite, so without a word I fell in beside him and set to work. \n\nIt was a beautiful free-for-all and I was having the time of my life. I practically pranced around the yard, grabbing up anything I felt capable of getting over the side of the giant trash receptacle. Toys, scrap metal, fast food trash, some ugly ass yard ornaments Allen‚Äôs ex-wife had set out back in the late 90‚Äôs. Plastic frogs and flamingoes, bleached and dried brittle by 20 plus years of sun and weather cycles.\n\nIt was the most fun I‚Äôve since the free resort weekend I scored just for attending a time share seminar and buying a share of a sweet villa in Branson, Missouri. \n\nOddly enough though, after a solid half hour of work Allen hadn‚Äôt said a word, or even acknowledged my presence for that matter. I finally broke the ice.\n\n‚ÄúHey buddy! Just thought I‚Äôd come out here and give you some help. You‚Äôve got a BIG job on your hands here, but it‚Äôll be totally worth the effort. I even have a perfect grass seed blend for you. I came up with it myself after a long battle with clover. You won‚Äôt believe how good it‚Äôll look in a few weeks!‚Äù\n\nAllen never acknowledged my presence. He just continued, pushing himself harder and harder. His hair was all over the place and sweat had soaked through his clothes from head to toe. \n\nA thought suddenly hit me. \n\nI lightly grabbed him by the upper arm and said ‚ÄúHey Allen. Did you ever stop last night?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\n\nI pressed further ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt come in at all? You‚Äôve just been out here nonstop?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù\n\nIt was killing me. I risked ruining everything, but I had to ask.\n\n‚ÄúHey man‚Ä¶Why are you suddenly cleaning up after 20 years of neglecting your yard and ignoring everyone who has ever asked you to do something about it?‚Äù\n\nUnder labored breath, still without slowing even a step or glancing my direction, he said \n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming.‚Äù\n\nI inquired further. \n\n‚ÄúWho‚Äôs coming? You having a family get together? Pampered Chef party? Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses stopping by to check on your soul?‚Äù\n\nAllen suddenly snapped up, lunged at me and screamed directly in my face.\n\n‚ÄúNO‚Ä¶NO NO NO!!‚Äù\n\nHe abruptly turned and went right back to picking up a large chunk of a broken toilet covered in wet leaves, heaving it into the dumpster and waddling to the other side of the driveway to begin unearthing an old riding mower covered in the remnants of a splintered water bed frame.  \n\nI was a bit caught off guard by the aggression. Regardless, I was so happy to see Allen‚Äôs grass for the first time since April 22nd, 2001 that I was willing to overlook his anger. Still, though, at that point I felt it best to just go on back home. \n\nI went ahead and started on my garage floor project. I backed my RAV-4 out into the driveway. I didn‚Äôt have to deal with Karen‚Äôs Volvo because she had an early appointment at the hair salon, then planned to return some things at a department store she felt were dishonestly presented by the salesperson‚Ä¶I think she planned on giving that manager a piece of her mind.\n\nAfter a few more days of cleaning outside, inside, and having a huge fence built around the yard, Allen‚Äôs place was looking great. I decided I would go shake the hands of whatever visitors he was having that had motivated him to take on this glorious project.\n\nAs it turned out, I was given the opportunity to do so sooner than expected. Allen‚Äôs guests arrived the very next day. \n\nIt was an interesting looking bunch that piled out of a few of those monster passenger vans. Upon closer inspection I saw the side of them said ‚ÄúZIP-LIFE HOLISTICS.‚Äù Everyone looked to be under 40 or so, and some of them couldn‚Äôt have been much past their high school years. Athletic wear‚Äîmore specifically, track suits‚Äîwas the prevailing choice in attire for every single one of them. Each of them wore a different color, though, and when they got out of the vans it was like someone dumped a bag of skittles onto the driveway.\n\nTheir energy was boundless. Running, jumping, and shouting loudly with the same enthusiasm I feel when my grass finally reaches the 4.5 inch mark and I get to fire up the Cub Cadet. God I love that mower. \n\nEveryone congregated in the front yard, surrounding Allen and giving him endless handshakes and pats on the back. Allen looked exhausted, but he had put on his best smile for the greeting. \n\nBehind that big smile though, terror filled his eyes.\n\nThe next morning at 7:00 *on the dot,* the cheers began.\n\n*‚ÄúWHO-LIVES-THEIR-LIFE WITH ZIP AND PRIDE??‚Äù*\n\n‚ÄúWE DO! WE DO!‚Äù\n\n*‚ÄúWHO FLOWS WITH JOY THEY CAN-NOT HIDE??‚Äù*\n\n‚ÄúWE DO! WE DO!‚Äù\n\nThey did this OVER and OVER and OVER for a solid 15 minutes, stopping only to cheer and clap. \n\nFinally, they shut it down and bounded off to the van where a woman was handing out leaflets of some sort. They began to sprint off throughout the neighborhood, so after all of them were gone I sauntered over to talk to Allen. He was alone in the yard, dressed in a lime green track suit and doing jumping jacks. \n\nI feigned enthusiasm.\n\n‚ÄúHey buddy. How‚Äôs it going with the visitors? They‚Äôre sure an energetic bunch!‚Äù\n\nHis attitude had turned a complete 180 degrees. ‚ÄúOh, hey Brad! Yeah, they‚Äôre stupendous! What a great bunch of people. They‚Äôre gonna change the life of everyone in this neighborhood. Just you wait and see!‚Äù\n\nDespite Allen‚Äôs zeal, I was skeptical and still a touch unnerved by the arrival of these health ambassadors. I mean‚Ä¶maybe they *could* help the neighborhood get back on track. Quarantine had really taken its toll on the midsection and hind quarters of just about everyone in Saddle Downs. Working from home was awesome, but the cafeteria choices were endless now. Eating had become a sport for me by that point. \n\nI figured I could try and get on board. It was just a bunch of over-zealous kids, right?\n\n‚ÄúWell Allen, I suppose all of us could use some guidance right now‚Ä¶and maybe they‚Äôve got some techniques to help us avoid Covid, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, *most definitely* brad. Most definitely. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù\n\nThat was enough for me for the moment. As I started back to my own yard, I turned back and asked Allen how he got involved with these people. \n\n‚ÄúI met them on the Internet playing an ORPG game called Second Life!‚Äù\n\nI had no idea what that was, but the answer was good enough for me. \n\nI cruised back over to the house, figuring Karen had my kale shake ready to go, along with a little avocado and falafel on toast that would likely NOT hit the spot. \n\nAs the day wore on, I kept an eye on things out on the streets of Saddle Downs. \n\nThe Lifers, as I‚Äôll refer to them, were going door-to-door with their flyers. Some successfully gained entry to make what I presumed was their sales pitch, while others maintained that huge smile and boundless enthusiasm after being turned away at the door. They did, however, leave a small yellow sticker on the mailbox on the way out. \n\nAllen continued to exercise, with one of the Zip-Life zealots cheering him on.\n\nEventually a couple of them were on my doorstep. Ugh. It was the first time I had seen any of them up close, and the only way I can describe them accurately is to say‚Ä¶\n\nThey *dazzled.* \n\nThe startlingly attractive young man and woman before me had perfectly straight, shockingly white teeth. Their aroma was fantastic, like some perfect blend of sugar cookies and Tide Pods. Clean, and sweet. It was intoxicating.\n\nTheir eyes were big, bright and full of life, reminding me of those things that endlessly swirl and put you into a daze while the hypnotist snatches your wallet. The whites were white enough to make me squint, and their irises were vivid in color and matched their track suits. The young man‚Äôs orange irises didn‚Äôt have that fake look you see with color contacts, either. I think they were legit, which for a split second sent a chill down my spine. \n\nAs the young man began his pitch, perfectly straight, blindingly white teeth opened to a mouth that said ‚ÄúHello sir! I‚Äôm Tanner and this is Kylee. We‚Äôre friends of your neighbor, Allen Randall, and are representatives of the world‚Äôs number one door-to-door health and wellness company, Zip-Life Holistics!‚Äù\n\nI have no idea what he said after that. All I remember is smiling dreamily, looking back and forth between their mesmerizing eyes, skin that appeared to have disco balls embedded in its pores, and feeling compelled to only breathe through my nose. I found my feet shifting below me as I pushed open the storm door and welcomed them into my home. Floating in sheer ecstasy, I led them to the couch, where they sat down and produced a flyer for me to read. \n\nAt that moment, all I could think of was how much I wanted to please these strangers. How I would do absolutely *anything* for Taylor and Kylee. \n\n*Yes, I‚Äôll sign those forms. Yes, I‚Äôll be ready at 10pm on Friday. Sure, I‚Äôll be eating nothing but raw, organic foods until then. I‚Äôll do everything just as you wish. I just want to be well, for YOU. Thank you for saving me.‚Äù*\n\nThank God for Karen. She had been in the Kitchen, live streaming one of her ‚ÄúSuper Coupon‚Äù videos (she has 152 subscribers‚Ä¶not too shabby, right?) and hadn‚Äôt noticed Tanner and Kylee‚Äôs entrance until the smell hit her. \n\n‚ÄúWho‚Äôs here? That‚Äôs not Gain. That‚Äôs Tide. That shit is expensive! Someone needs a coupon lesson!‚Äù\n\nShe stopped dead in her tracks when she saw me starting to sign papers. \n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you sign anything Brad! They‚Äôre probably gonna hit your credit card for a hundred bucks a month or something.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou kids skedaddle. Didn‚Äôt you see the magnet on my car? I blend **ESSENTIAL OILS**. Do you know what that means? It means get the heck out of my house with your worthless pills, or whatever other malarkey you‚Äôre peddling. It ain‚Äôt happenin‚Äô! Not on my watch!‚Äù\n\nThe two beautiful, amazing smelling Lifers smiled, thanked me for my time, and gave Karen a little death stare as they made for the door. Karen followed them into the yard, yelling the whole way. \n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you make a face at me! I‚Äôve got your leaflet in the house and don‚Äôt you think for a second that I won‚Äôt call your manager about these shady tactics you‚Äôre using!‚Äù\n\nI exhaled sharply and ran my hands across my face to wake up a bit. When I looked back up they were gone‚Ä¶and one of those little yellow stickers adorned our mailbox.\n\nKaren gave me a bit of a scolding after she came back inside, but I *did* deserve it. It didn‚Äôt last too long, though, because she had to get to work on a big batch of potato salad to take to a party at my office. Those people *love* her recipe. \n\nThe rest of the Lifers eventually congregated back at Allen‚Äôs house. It looked like they were camping in the back yard, which is probably why Allen had that absurdly high fence installed. \n\nAround 7pm, things got‚Ä¶***weird***. \n\nFirstly, there was more cheering. \n\nAfter the noise subsided I could hear a lot of grunting and groaning, and eventually curiosity got the best of me. I grabbed a ladder and made my way up to the roof. Our houses are more diagonally lined up, so with a bit of height I got a pretty clear view of Allen‚Äôs back yard.\n\nIt looked like they were performing feats of strength.\n\nSome of them began picking up landscaping rocks the size of watermelons, followed by each taking a turn throwing theirs across the yard as far as possible. The best throw was about 15 feet, which was REALLY far for a rock that I would guess weighs around 200lbs. \n\nThe winner? Kylee, all 5‚Äô2 and 120lbs of her.\n\nAfter that, some of the men locked arms and legs, building upon each other for some kind of creation. Bodies twisted and contorted, eventually taking the shape of a wheel‚Ä¶complete with human spokes.\n\nOne of the women gave them a push, and off they went, rolling across the yard. It was an impressive feat of strength and flexibility‚Ä¶and just a touch unsettling. The wheel made it back around the yard, and several more of the men stood on others‚Äô shoulders on both sides of the ‚Äúwheel,‚Äù eventually revealing themselves to be posts. The entire contraption together became a freaky Ferris wheel. Someone gave it a push, and off it went, slowly rotating on an axis made of the backs of their brethren. \n\nThat was both mesmerizing AND freaky, but a big group of the women, however, *really* pushed the envelope. The men began to chant.\n\nDO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!\n\nIt took a few minutes for it all to come together, but after everyone was in position I was looking at all 20 of the women bent into *impossible* positions and exercising body control that would require the strength of a herd of elephants. Arms bent backward, shoulders dislocated and twisted in ways that would paralyze any normal person. I felt bile rise in my throat, even viewing it from over 100 feet away.\n\nAll the disgusting contortions came together, and suddenly I was looking at a 10 foot tall spider with the entire body and 8 legs made of people who should have been dead from their positioning alone. \n\n*And it wasn‚Äôt unstable*. It wasn‚Äôt about to collapse like one of those shitty popsicle stick houses we made in kindergarten. Had it not been so terrifying, it would have been nothing short of magnificent.\n\nAnd then that spider WALKED‚Ä¶\n\nAnd then it RAN‚Ä¶ \n\nTheir bodies were in perfect harmony as ‚Äúit‚Äù ran across the back yard. \n\nMore chanting.\n\n‚ÄúSPI-DER! SPI-DER! SPI-DER! SPI-DER!‚Äù\n\nContinuing to run with absolute accuracy, they began to emit a clicking sound that I can only describe as ‚Äúhow a spider sounds in a movie.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTICK-A TICK-A TICK-A TICK-A!\n\nTICK-A TICK-A TICK-A TICK-A‚Äù\n\nMy skin was crawling at this point. \n\nThen, as if the situation couldn‚Äôt get any more bizarre and terrifying, I watched as that human spider crawled right up the back wall of Allen‚Äôs three story house and onto the roof. And when it stopped I realized that before it crawled up the house, several of the men had jumped on and stacked themselves close on the front of the spider body. Their heads were packed tightly together, and their eyes became the spider‚Äôs eyes. \n\nAnd they blinked in unison.\n\nThen it shifted a bit. The legs, the body, and those eyes, rotating around while a few dozen mouths emitted that ‚Äútick-a tick-a tick-a‚Äù sound. In a side profile stance, facing off in the distance it stood. \n\nIt felt as if everything around me had gone silent. This wasn‚Äôt just funny, or creepy anymore. It was downright scary. And as I soaked it all in and began to wonder what the hell I was really witnessing, I watched, horrified as every Lifer on that hideous creation turned their head toward me.\n\nAnd they smiled‚Ä¶ \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI slept like absolute shit that night. After the spider spent a few minutes twitching around on the roof and looking at me, it/they crawled back down to the yard and disassembled. Eventually everyone settled down and I didn‚Äôt hear anything else until early morning when the daily cheering began again. \n\nI must admit, the spider really scared me. When I said those girls got into impossible positions I was NOT exaggerating. I was looking at fully dislocated shoulders and hips, spines twisted up like paper clips, and heads that twisted completely around. These were not normal people.\n\nThis routine continued for the rest of the week. \n\n\\-Wake up and cheer\n\n\\-Work the neighborhood \n\n\\-Cheer some more\n\n\\-Do weird shit in the back yard until dark, including but not limited to\n\n\\-Relay races (on their hands)\n\n\\-Professional-style wrestling (without padding)\n\n\\-Duck, Duck, Goose and Red Rover (with tackling)\n\n\\-Forming a human snake 50 feet long and slithering around the house for 45 straight minutes, with everyone making a ‚Äússsssssssssssssssssssss‚Äù sound and flicking their tongues. Then every few minutes coiling up and striking at imaginary things.\n\nThey did try to make their pitch to us once each day, becoming more persistent as the week progressed, but Karen always shooed them off. On their Friday afternoon visit she even sprayed them with lavender oil. Tanner looked PISSED about it, too. As the days wore on, though, I noticed the little yellow stickers eventually being removed, and figured my weak minded neighbors were finally giving in and agreeing to the presentation. Not Karen, though. She‚Äôs hardcore about this kind of thing. \n\nFour days into this adventure, I noticed something. I had never seen them eating, drinking, or going into the house to use the bathroom. I did see twice a day they were given a shot glass worth of some kind of liquid, which I presumed was whatever product they must be selling\n\nDespite it all, the neighborhood was still running normally. People came and went, cars were washed, and dogs were walked. Mrs. Bush down the street was in her front yard, drunk and arguing with her adult son, who was also drunk, about his chronic unemployment and wasting his government money on ‚Äúcheap women.‚Äù\n\nFriday night, Karen and I were sipping some of our favorite craft beer on the porch when we noticed an abnormally large number of people heading down the street. I recognized some of the faces and others were foreign to me, but they all turned in to Allen‚Äôs driveway and formed a line that extended a ways down the street. I suddenly recalled something on Tanner and Kylee‚Äôs pamphlet about ‚Äúbeing there‚Äù on Friday at 10pm. A quick check of my watch confirmed that it was, in-fact, 10pm. Now I was REALLY interested to see what was going down.  \n\nI moved from the porch to the living room to watch one of these quarantine MLB games, which was almost as weird as watching the Lifers do their thing. I kept a constant eye on the goings-on at Allen‚Äôs though and as the evening wore on the traffic really picked up. For hours I sat there watching neighbors get in line, looking completely happy and relaxed‚Äîno doubt enjoying the Scent of sugar cookies and eye candy the Lifers provided‚Äîwaiting their turn to go behind the gate. Several of the Lifers looked to almost be standing guard there, with more standing along the street in front of the house.\n\nAll night long, the cycle was the same. \n\n\\-Person goes through the gate on one side of the house, followed by a few minutes of silence.\n\n\\-Horrific screaming, followed by the Lifers clapping and cheering.\n\n\\-Then the person shuffled out of the gate on the other side of the house, and very slowly shuffled home. \n\nBy 2am, I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore. I had to get a look behind that house again, even if it WAS a shitty angle. \n\nI was headed for the roof again.\n\nI grabbed my ladder and began my ascent. As I reached the top rung and my head cleared the roof line, I heard a voice coming from below‚Äîaccompanied by the very faint smell of sugar cookies. \n\nIt was Tanner. \n\n‚ÄúHey Brad! Whatcha doin‚Äô up there?‚Äù He gave the ladder a little shake. \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe to be up on the roof this late. Why don‚Äôt you come on down and go back in the house? Kylee said Karen looks pretty lonely in the bed.‚Äù\n\nThey were watching Karen sleep??\n\nNow I was angry. I felt a surge of adrenaline, and it was finally time to tell this asshole what I really thought of him and his stupid Lifer friends. \n\n‚ÄúTanner, why don‚Äôt YOU get the FUCK out of my yard and go back to your weird-ass cult across the street before I call the cops!‚Äù\n\nTanner chuckled and said ‚ÄúBraaaaaaad. YOUR NEIGHBOR, the chief of police is in line at Allen‚Äôs right this minute. You know that.‚Äù\n\nAnd then he literally jumped straight up the 30 feet to my roof.\n\nTanner crouched directly in front of me, grabbed my ladder and tipped me a foot back from the edge, literally holding my life in his right hand.\n\nHis orange eyes glowed like two big fireflies in the darkness. \n\n‚ÄúBrad. Everything is fine over there. It would REALLY be in your best interest to climb back down this VERY unstable ladder and get ‚Äúthe FUCK‚Äù back in your house.‚Äù\n\nI nodded, scared shitless. My adrenaline surged again as I gripped that ladder with every ounce of strength I had. There was no exit plan here if he let me go, and I am not ashamed to admit that I wet my pants.\n\n‚ÄúOk, Tanner. I‚Äôll go back inside. Please, PLEASE move my ladder back and let me climb down.‚Äù\n\nAnd just like that, he returned the ladder to a safe angle, got in a high-dive position and did a gainer off the roof, landing perfectly on his feet.\n\nWhen I stepped off, he was directly in my face. He did NOT smell like cookies and Tide now. He smelled musty, like an old museum. The glimmer in his skin came and went like static on a TV, and his eyes no longer dazzled. He looked tired, as if he‚Äôd used up every ounce of his normally boundless energy.\n\nThat‚Äôs the last thing I remember.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI woke up on the couch around 7:00. My drool-covered shirt was turned halfway around my torso and one of my socks was missing in action. I felt absolutely awful. Every muscle ached to some degree and my feet felt like they were made of lead.  I was completely exhausted, and my back felt like it was on fire. I made it to the kitchen and tried to get my head together. Out of nowhere, I was suddenly ready to MURDER someone for some bacon‚Ä¶or sausage‚Ä¶or a bagel with Lox‚Ä¶or some Lay‚Äôs potato chips‚Ä¶or a big glass of sea water. I threw my middle finger in the air and turned in a circle to let ALL the components of Karen‚Äôs stupid plant-based diet know what I thought of them. Dr. Ornish could eat a dick‚Ä¶actually I guess he wouldn‚Äôt, though. \n\nI practically DRAGGED myself to the window to see what the Lifers were up to.\n\nThey were gone.\n\nI was startled as Karen emerged from the hallway, tripped, and fell flat on her face, sending half a dozen essential oil vials flying across the room. I was too tired to even try to help her up.\n\nGroaning, she pushed herself up on her elbows.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the hell happened last night, Brad? The last thing I remember is that Kylee girl standing beside my bed speaking in another language. There were bits of English mixed in there. She said something like ‚Äòwe are ancient‚Ä¶older than death himself‚Ä¶‚Äô and then something about cows and pigs no longer being sufficient?‚Äù \n\nI looked at her like she had three eyes. Not only was I in tremendous pain‚Ä¶I was feeling a little combative.\n\n‚ÄúWhat? Are you drunk? Did you put too much lemongrass and ylang-ylang in your tea again last night??‚Äù\n\nWhen Karen is pissed, her voice gets really nasal and her A‚Äôs are literally enough to bust eardrums. After my smartass comment, I really had it coming, though.\n\n‚ÄúNOOOOOOO BRAAAAD! She said it! She said that shit, and the last thing of it I recall is her rolling me over onto my stomach and saying ‚ÄúThanks bitch. I‚Äôll fill you back up with Marjoram.‚Äù\n\nShe had managed to stand again, but doubled over in pain and hit the floor once more. \n\n‚ÄúUghhhhhh‚Ä¶Damn-it Brad, why does my back hurt SOOOOO BAAAAD???‚Äù \n\nI looked down at her exposed back. It was swollen and red, and she had a tiny hole or needle mark just above each kidney. I had the same. What the heck was up there?\n\nTrying to look at my own back, I began turning in circles like a dog trying to sniff its own butt. \n\n‚ÄúKaren, look at these holes in my back. What‚Äôs in that spot?‚Äù\n\nShe had spent a few years in nursing school back in the day before quitting to sell door-to-door cosmetics, and god only knows what other flavor of the week MLMs that came about.\n\nShe thought about it for a moment. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs the adrenal gland. What the‚Ä¶did they steal our adrenaline???!!!\n\nI helped Karen to her feet, we plopped ourselves down at the kitchen table, and I blacked out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThree hours later I woke up, my cheek smashed down on the table. Surrounding me was remnants of a bag of beef jerky, a jar of pickles with no juice, and my mouth was caked in what tasted like feta cheese. Karen was on the floor, blocking the doorway threshold and mumbling something in her sleep about not needing a receipt. Peeking out from under the edge of her robe was what was left of the block of feta.\n\nI shuffled my way to the bathroom, stripped off my disheveled and urine stained clothes, and let a hot shower take me away to paradise. God I was thirsty. Karen says the chlorine and fluoride in city water is bad for me, but I didn‚Äôt care. I drank it right out of the faucet. \n\nAfter getting cleaned up, I stepped out on the patio for some fresh air. Many of my neighbors were out and about, moving like they were 100 years old but trying to do the normal stuff--taking walks, washing cars, etc. I gingerly made my way next door to speak with my buddy Mike. He had been out of town most of the week, but I saw him in line last night. I caught up to him as he was checking his mail.\n\n‚ÄúYo Mike. How‚Äôs it going?‚Äù\n\nHe looked terrible. ‚ÄúHey Brad. Man I feel like complete shit. I don‚Äôt know what the hell happened to me last night. I haven‚Äôt felt this bad since I got completely plastered at your Super bowl party.‚Äù\n\nI vividly remember that event. Mike, the 50 year old accountant, attempted a backflip on a dare and landed on his face.\n\nI looked at him quizzically. ‚ÄúYou mean you don‚Äôt remember being at Allen‚Äôs? Going behind the fence for the Zip-Life product demonstration?‚Äù\n\nHe closed the mailbox and looked back up at me. \n\n‚ÄúThe what? Zip Who? I haven‚Äôt spoken with Allen in months. I‚Äôd like to kiss him right on the mouth though, for finally cleaning up his property. I wish I had been here to see it. Damn, dude. My back is killing me!‚Äù\n\nHe turned and raised his shirt, and sure enough‚Ä¶ the same swelling and holes in his back.\n\nI told him what I suspected had happened to us, but he had absolutely no recollection of the Lifers ever having set foot in Saddle Downs. I was too tired to press the issue, and Mike didn‚Äôt seem to care about the holes in his back. It‚Äôs like his memory and even his sense of self-preservation was just‚Ä¶absent.\n\nI ended the conversation and made my way a couple houses down, intercepting a lady named Sandra as she VERY slowly made her way through the morning walk she‚Äôs taken every single day for 23 years. We had the same conversation. She had the same marks, and like Mike, had no memory of the night before. \n\nI tried several others and got more of the same. Finally I headed for Allen‚Äôs house, banging HARD on the door. When he answered, it was clear that I had woken him up. He was wearing nothing but a pair of old, very undersized boxers.\n\n‚ÄúUhhh‚Ä¶hey Brad. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAllen, I‚Äôve had enough of this shit. What the hell did those people do to everyone last night??‚Äù\n\nHe looked completely confused. ‚ÄúWhat? What are you talking about? Who?‚Äù\n\nI roared with every ounce of strength I had left. \n\n‚ÄúTHE ZIP-LIFE PEOPLE, ALLEN! THEY JACKED EVERYONE UP! WE ALL HAVE HOLES ABOVE OUR KIDNEYS AND NO ONE KNOWS WHY! I‚ÄôM THE ONLY ONE THAT EVEN REMEMBERS THEM BEING HERE!‚Äù\n\nAll of a sudden it was like the light bulb went off. Allen‚Äôs eyes nearly popped out of his skull. I exhaled sharply, relieved that SOMEONE could finally shed some light on all of this. \n\nAllen jumped through the door, darting back and forth across the porch, giving evil stares to everyone he could see.\n\nAs he flew by me for the third time I caught a look at his shirtless back‚Ä¶\n\nThere was nothing. \n\nNo holes. No swelling. Just a nice, plump back with enough hair on it to sculpt a mowhawk.\n\nAnd as he ran out into the street with murder in his eyes, naked aside from the underwear hanging halfway down his ass, I knew the story had ended. I wasn‚Äôt going to get my answer, because I knew what the next words out of his mouth would be.\n\nWild-eyed, and practically foaming at the mouth with rage, he said‚Ä¶\n\n***‚ÄúWHICH ONE OF YOU ASSHOLES CLEANED UP MY YARD!‚Äù***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My favorite neighbor](https://www.reddit.com/r/hgtv_neighbor/)",

    "body": "# A lot of people from this subreddit have been asking this question and i got this article together to answer that question. I hope it helps. Cheers.\n\nI honestly have found great help when i started taking Omega 3 in a daily basis, Vitamin B1 B6 B12, enough zinc, magnesium and Vitamin D.\n\nPS : for those who also want to increase their testosterone, improving your mood and lowering Cortisol greatly helps.\n\n# Stress Reduction\n\nOur bodies release cortisol when stressed. **Cortisol decreases serotonin levels in the body**, by increasing serotonin reuptake. Too much cortisol can increase your risk of developing mental health disorders. That is why **reducing mental stress can help balance cortisol levels and increase serotonin**\n\nMany of the lifestyle changes below can be used to decrease stress.\n\n# Mood Improvement\n\nSerotonin impacts our mood, but mood also affects serotonin production. Studies using brain imaging (PET), showed that **brains of people who are happy produce more serotonin** than brains of people who are sad\n\nTherefore, engaging in activities and doing things that make you happier can help boost serotonin production.\n\nIn addition, studies show that social interactions also influence serotonin levels. Spend more time with people who make you feel good in general\n\n# Exercise\n\nFatigue, as a result of exercise, increases the amount of tryptophan that can cross the blood-brain barrier (by decreasing BCAA levels) and thereby boosts serotonin production. Psychological benefits of physical exercise can be more readily achieved with consistent aerobic exercise training\n\nMice that ran on treadmills had higher levels of serotonin compared to mice that remained inactive. Brain tryptophan remained high even after exercise\n\n# Getting More Sun\n\nIt has been long known that bright light helps treat seasonal depression. But several studies suggest that light is also an effective treatment for other forms of depression\n\n**People have higher serotonin levels in the summer compared to winter**\n\nIn fact, our modern way of life, in which we spend a lot of time indoors, may be depleting our serotonin levels, thereby making us more vulnerable to mood disorders\n\nPioneer studies suggest that **our skin may produce serotonin when exposed to sunlight**\n\nIn addition, **you need vitamin D to produce serotonin**, and sun to produce vitamin D\n\nTherefore, going outside and spending more time in the sun on a regular basis is a great way to boost your serotonin levels.\n\n# Yoga and Meditation\n\nA review of over 200 peer-reviewed RCTs, clinical trials, and meta-analyses studying complementary and alternative medicine suggest that **yoga and meditation may help uplift mood and improve symptoms of mild, moderate, and treatment-resistant depression**\n\nIn fact, meditation activates many parts of the brain important for understanding the self, emotions, problem-solving, adaptability, and increasing awareness. Serotonin plays a role in wakefulness, along with other **neurotransmitters, which are all raised in meditators**\n\nThirty minutes of yoga and breathing exercises improved mood in a study of 71 healthy adults\n\n# Psychotherapy\n\nPsychotherapy or counseling may change brain chemistry and even increase serotonin activity (by increasing serotonin receptors). In a (DB-RCT) study of 23 patients with depression who participated in psychotherapy for 4 months, **therapy significantly increased serotonin activity and improved symptoms of depression**\n\n# Eat to Increase Serotonin\n\nTryptophan is the amino acid building block for serotonin. Tryptophan is not produced by the body, so it must be taken in through diet.\n\nCurrent research shows that unlike purified tryptophan, **consuming tryptophan-rich foods does not necessarily increase brain serotonin**. That‚Äôs because tryptophan-rich foods, such as meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, also contain many other amino acids. Tryptophan has to compete with these other amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier\n\nOn the other hand, lack of dietary tryptophan (compared to other amino acids) may lead to lower blood and brain tryptophan levels, decreasing serotonin production. **Increased BCAAs also lower tryptophan and serotonin**, as well as dopamine in the brain. This may be especially problematic for people who take protein powders to enhance exercise performance\n\n# Carbs\n\n**Consuming carbs increases serotonin levels** by increasing the transport of tryptophan into the brain\n\nHowever, you should use other methods to boost your serotonin, as increasing carbs in your diet can have a plethora of negative effects.\n\n# which Supplements can Increase Serotonin?\n\n# L-Tryptophan and 5-HTP\n\nIn the body, L-tryptophan is used to make 5-HTP from which serotonin is made. Taking L-tryptophan may raise plasma serotonin, improving cognitive, motor, or gut issues in those who are deficient\n\nA protein called **alpha-Lactalbumin** from milk contains more tryptophan than many other proteins. In a (DB-RCT) study of 18 inpiduals, 12 grams of alpha-Lactalbumin increased the amount of tryptophan in blood plasma by 16% after 90 minutes\n\nIn another (DB-RCT) study, 12.32 grams of tryptophan increased blood tryptophan by 43% after 1.5 hours and improved memory in 23 subjects vulnerable to high stress\n\nIn a pilot study of 13 female patients experiencing premenstrual syndrome (PMS), 6 grams of L-tryptophan taken daily for 14 days improved mood, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and carbohydrate craving\n\nTryptophan can be purchased in the form of L-tryptophan supplements. 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) supplements are also available. It is important to note that 5-HTP is not the same as 5-HT, which is the chemical name for serotonin. 5-HTP freely crosses the blood-brain barrier (serotonin itself does not) to be converted into serotonin\n\n# Probiotics\n\nIn the digestive tract, **probiotics restore the gut microbiome** and influence the gut-brain axis. Gut bacteria are important because they can produce tryptophan, from which serotonin is made. Many mental health disorders, such as Parkinson‚Äôs disease, are linked to less perse or fewer gut bacteria\n\nIn a study (DB-RTC), an 8-week probiotic regimen (2.0 x 109 CFU/g of *Lactobacillus helveticus* and 2.0 x 109 CFU/g of *Bifidobacterium longum*) increased tryptophan levels in 110 inpiduals with depression. Increased tryptophan can increase serotonin production\n\nA probiotic (*Bifidobacteria infantis*) given to rats for 14 days raised levels of blood tryptophan\n\n# Vitamin D\n\n**Vitamin D helps the body make, release, and use serotonin in the brain**. Vitamin D activates an enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin. If vitamin D levels are low, our brains make less serotonin. Thus, increasing vitamin D intake increases serotonin levels, reducing the risk of mental health disorders\n\nA cohort study of over 9K subjects demonstrated that taking vitamin D supplements during the first year of life was correlated with a 77% reduced risk of schizophrenia. In other words, **preventing low vitamin D levels early in life may reduce the chance of having schizophrenia later in life**\n\n# Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n\nWhile vitamin D helps neurons make serotonin, the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), **help neurons release serotonin** and improve its activity (increasing serotonin receptor sensitivity). Fish, such as salmon or trout, are high in omega-3 fatty acids. The omega 3 fatty acid supplements are also sold as fish oil capsules\n\nInadequate omega-3 fatty acids intake may increase susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses, including depression\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study of 49 patients that repeatedly self-harm themselves, 1.2 grams of EPA and 0.9 grams of DHA capsules daily for 12 weeks reduced suicidal thinking by 45% and depression by 30%\n\nAn observational study of 256,118 Japanese participants, discovered that people who ate fish daily had lower rates of suicidal thoughts compared to people who did not eat fish daily. In another observational study of 1,767 Finnish subjects, consuming fish less than twice a week was associated with a higher risk of depression and suicidal thinking\n\nIn rats, low levels of omega-3 fatty acids (specifically alpha linoleic acid) are associated with lower serotonin activity, while DHA deficiency reduces brain serotonin in piglets\n\n**Reduced intake of both EPA and DHA** by pregnant rats resulted in less production, storage, release, and activity (receptor function) of serotonin in the brains of their offspring. Serotonin was not only reduced in the mothers‚Äô brains but also its availability and production were reduced by (65% and 29%, respectively) in the brains of newborn rats\n\n# St. John‚Äôs Wort\n\nSt. John‚Äôs Wort is a popular medicinal plant (*Hypericum perforatum*) used as an antidepressant for mild depression.\n\nThe plant **increases serotonin in animals, similar to typical antidepressants**, but with fewer side effects\n\nIn a review (of 35 studies) of 6,993 patients with depression, St. John‚Äôs Wort standalone therapy improved mild to moderate symptoms as well as antidepressants and better than placebo. The typical dose is 300 mg of the extract 3 times per day for at least 4 weeks\n\n# S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAMe)\n\nSAMe is needed to produce serotonin\n\nIt is a naturally occurring compound that plays a role in methylation, energy breakdown and may help patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are not responding to conventional, synthetic antidepressants\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study involving 73 MDD inpiduals unresponsive to drug therapy, **800 mg twice a day improved symptoms of depression** compared to the placebo\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study of 144 inpiduals with MDD, **1,600 ‚Äì 3,200 mg of SAMe daily** for 12 weeks significantly improved mood\n\nA review of 132 studies (115 CT and 17 preclinical) concluded **that SAMe can be useful not just for depression**, but for an array of mental health disorders, such as substance abuse and psychosis\n\n# Vitamin B\n\nLack of vitamin B may be associated with the onset of mental health disorders. The body needs Vitamin B6 to make neurotransmitters like serotonin from 5-HTP (Vitamin B acts as enzyme cofactor)\n\nVitamin B12 and folate (vitamin B9) are necessary for the folate cycle, which helps convert tryptophan into serotonin (by producing and recycling essential co-factors)\n\nIn a cohort study of 549 community-dwelling seniors, those with low vitamin B12 and B9 blood levels were more likely to have irreversible problems with cognition (memory, attention, and thought)\n\nIn Rhesus monkeys, a single dose of vitamin B6 increased serotonin production in the brain\n\nIn addition, treatment of healthy adult rats with a vitamin B mixture raised serotonin levels in the brain\n\n# Vitamin C\n\nVitamin C supplements over a period of 6 weeks increased brain serotonin levels in rats with drug-induced dementia\n\n# Vitamin E\n\nVitamin E supplementation for 8 weeks increased serotonin in rats suffering from spinal cord injury\n\n# Zinc\n\nZinc can target and activate serotonin receptors\n\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 observational studies, **blood zinc levels were lower in depressed inpiduals** compared to non-depressed inpiduals\n\nIn a study (DB-RCT), 25 mg of elemental zinc supplements daily for 12 weeks reduced depressive symptoms in a study of 37 patients with major depressive disorder\n\nZinc can be increased through diet in foods such as red meat, oysters, and whole grains\n\n# Magnesium\n\nMagnesium supplements increase serotonin levels by increasing its availability (reducing reuptake) in the brain. In a (DB-RCT) study, 500 mg of magnesium per day for 8 weeks significantly improved symptoms in 60 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate depression\n\nMagnesium is found in green leafy vegetables, nuts, and legumes\n\n# Inositol\n\nInositol increases the sensitivity of serotonin receptors\n\nIn one study of 30 women with a PMS mood disorder, myo-inositol reduced symptoms and improved mood given over 6 menstrual cycles\n\nInositol decreases depression in rats by binding serotonin receptors\n\n# Turmeric\n\nCurcumin is the active component of turmeric. In stressed rats, **curcumin extended the length of time serotonin stays active in the brain** (by blocking the reuptake of serotonin). It also improved cognition and reduced serum corticosterone, a cortisol equivalent, in rats\n\nIn mice, a single dose of curcumin (10 ‚Äì 80 mg/kg) increased serotonin levels\n\n# Velvet Bean\n\n*Mucuna* *pruriens*, known as the velvet bean, combats Parkinson‚Äôs disease better than the standard treatment (levodopa) in rats. In addition to being a source of dopamine, the long-term use of the powder form of *Mucuna pruriens* also **restored serotonin levels in rat brains**\n\n# L-Theanine\n\nL-theanine, an amino acid found in tea leaves (e.g. green, black, or oolong tea) and Bay Bolete mushrooms, has relaxing effects on the mind. **Green tea has the highest concentration of L-theanine**\n\nIn a cohort study of over 42K Japanese inpiduals, those who consumed at least 5 cups of green tea a day experiences less psychological distress that is often associated with reduced serotonin\n\nIn rat studies, L-theanine raised serotonin levels in the brain\n\n# Rhodiola\n\n*Rhodiola rosea* is a flowering plant that may help improve anxiety and depression. In a (DB-RCT) clinical trial of 89 patients with mild to moderate depression and low serotonin, *Rhodiola rosea* extracts (340 mg/day and 680 mg/day) for 42 days i**mproved overall depression, including** **insomnia and emotional instability**\n\nIn 70 depressive rats suffering from chronic mild stress and serotonin deficiency, Rhodiola extract (1.5, 3, or 6g/kg) for 3 weeks **restored normal levels of serotonin**\n\n# Saffron\n\n**Safranal, one of the main active components of saffron** (*Crocus sativus*), increases serotonin availability in the brain (by blocking reuptake)\n\nA meta-analysis (5 RCTs) of 177 participants concluded that **30 mg per day of saffron capsules** can improve symptoms of depression in adults with major depressive disorder within 6 to 8 weeks\n\n# Psychedelics\n\nPsychedelics are hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms. **Psychedelics can stimulate serotonin activity** (by directly binding to serotonergic receptors and also increasing their number), raise serotonin levels, and reduce its breakdown\n\nIn a recent pilot study (DB-RCT) of 12 patients with anxiety, 200 Œºg of LSD significantly reduced self-reported anxiety. LSD was given in a **safe psychotherapeutic environment with medical supervision** to avoid side effects\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study of 17 healthy inpiduals, psilocybin (215 micrograms/kg) enhanced mood, increased goal-directed behavior and decreased recognition of negative facial expressions\n\nThough psychedelics can activate serotonin signaling, unsupervised use may lead to serious psychological consequences. Certain plant hallucinogens, as well as synthetic hallucinogens, can be especially toxic. Using this substance should be under professional supervision.\n\n# Magnolia Tree\n\nThe bark and seed cones of the Magnolia tree (*Magnolia officinalis*) appear to have anti-stress, anti-anxiety, and antidepressant effects\n\n20 and 40 mg/kg of honokiol and magnolol, the main components of *Magnolia officinalis*, **restored low levels of serotonin** in rats with chronic mild stress\n\nMagnolia bark and ginger rhizome are commonly used to treat mental disorders in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). 30 mg/kg of a **magnolia bark and ginger rhizome mixture increased serotonin in the brains** of depressed mice\n\n# Essential Oils\n\nEssential oils are commonly used to reduce anxiety, stress, low mood, and other mental health disorders. Smelling the essential oils (inhalation) can **activate pathways in the brain to boost serotonin and dopamine production**\n\nIn a study of aromatherapy in 60 elderly patients with depression (RCT), **5 ml of essential oil mixture** (containing lavender, sweet orange, bergamot, and almond oil) increased serotonin levels after application two times a week for 8 weeks\n\n**Ylang-ylang** essential oils increased serotonin levels in mice brains (hippocampus)\n\n**Bitter orange** is an essential oil that reduced anxiety and improved mood by boosting serotonin activity in mice after 14 days of use\n\n**Lavender oil** blocked the breakdown/reuptake of serotonin in cell studies\n\n# Valerian\n\nThe root of the Valerian plant **increases serotonin levels and activity** (by decreasing its turnover)\n\nValerian may help with irritable bowel syndrome. In a rat study, components of the Valeriani root balanced overactive serotonin in the gut (colon) and serum\n\n*Valeriana officinalis* root extract **prevented the breakdown of serotonin** in mice exposed to stress\n\n# Apigenin\n\n**Apigenin is a nutrient in citrus fruits** that may improve cognition and behavior as well as symptoms of depression and stress\n\nIn mouse models, 20-day treatment with apigenin (10 and 20 mg/kg) **increased serotonin levels, and decreased anxious behavior**\n\nApigenin was able to **reduce the impact of chronic mild stress in rats by increasing serotonin** availability and reducing its breakdown\n\n# Berberine\n\nBerberine is a salt derived from plants in the *Berberis* family (the roots, rhizomes, stems, and barks), including **barberry, tree turmeric, Oregon-grape**, and others. It blocks the enzyme MAO-A, which breaks down serotonin, thereby **raising serotonin levels**\n\nA single berberine dose increased levels of serotonin by 47% in the brains of depressed mice. Long-term treatment with berberine (5 mg/kg for 15 days) increased serotonin by 19%\n\nMice given berberine in a different study had increased serotonin levels in regions of the brain (hippocampus and frontal cortex) important for memory and mood\n\n# Acetyl-L-Carnitine\n\n**Carnitine may increase serotonin** in the cerebral cortex, a region of the brain involved in **cognition and memory**\n\nAcetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is a modified form of carnitine, a common dietary supplement sold in health food stores. ALCAR protects the brain and may help with depression. In mice, it increased levels of serotonin in the brain when given daily for 25 days\n\n# Lithium\n\nLithium has long been used in the treatment of mental disorders such as bipolar disorder. It works by increasing serotonin activity in the brain\n\n# Physical Treatments that Increase Serotonin\n\n# Neurofeedback\n\nNeurofeedback allows inpiduals to consciously **change their brain activity** (EEG waves) and therefore modify their behavior and cognition. Some of its clinical uses are for migraines, ADHD, and PTSD\n\nIn a study (RCT), neurofeedback (30 minutes, 5 sessions weekly, 4 weeks) was applied to 40 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS patients have lower serotonin and widespread pain in their muscles and bones. After 2 weeks, patients experienced less pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression\n\n# Massage\n\n**Massage therapy decreased cortisol and raised serotonin** and dopamine in a broad population with stress-related health problems in 3 studies\n\nIn one (RCT) study, 24 adults with low back pain were either given two 30 minute massages per week or subjected to standard relaxation procedures over the span of 5 weeks. Urine **serotonin levels were higher in inpiduals who received massage therapy**\n\n# Acupuncture\n\nIn a randomized clinical trial, 75 women with fibromyalgia, acupuncture increased levels of serotonin in the serum, compared to placebo\n\nIn rats, acupuncture-like stimulation increased serotonin activity in certain regions of the brain\n\n# Light Therapy\n\nWhen sun exposure is not possible, bright light therapy can help increase serotonin levels\n\nBright light therapy (photobiomodulation) shows promising results for depression based on clinical trials\n\nIn a study of 10 women with chronic headaches (observational), 34 seconds daily use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) significantly **increased serotonin levels after just 3 days**\n\nIn a study of 25 drug-free hospitalized veterans with depression or bipolar disorder, **bright white light improved depressive symptoms**. However, further testing needs to be done on the negative consequences of long-term light treatment\n\n# Vagus Nerve Stimulation\n\nLong-term vagus nerve stimulation (14 days) **increased serotonin levels** in rat brains\n\nIn rats, sustained vagus nerve stimulation for 14 days also **increased the action of serotonin**\n\n# Testing Serotonin\n\nSerotonin that gets released into the blood gets rapidly broken down in the liver and lungs, to inactive metabolites (such as 5-HIAA) that are excreted in urine . That is why normally, blood and urine contain very small amounts of serotonin. Larger quantities of serotonin in the blood/urine can be found in people with serotonin-producing tumors (carcinoid tumors).\n\n**Beware of the use of urine serotonin levels to check for ‚Äúneurotransmitter imbalances‚Äù.** While the companies providing these tests state that the levels in urine correspond to brain neurotransmitter levels, science has repeatedly shown that this is not the case\n\nSerotonin doesn‚Äôt cross the blood-brain barrier. Even if it did, it is released intermittently and influenced by many different stimuli. Furthermore, levels differ within different parts of the brain. And finally, values differ for the same person from one day to another\n\n**In addition, companies have been known to intentionally use extremely narrow ranges, without any scientific support whatsoever, in order to sell supplements to their clients**\n\nIf you do have neurotransmitter imbalances in the brain, more reliable tests of serotonin levels are cerebrospinal fluid tests or measurements of serotonin in blood platelets\n\nA PET scan is the only direct way to detect changes of serotonin production in specific areas of the brain\n\nSerotonin Risks and Safety\n\nExcess serotonin may result in **serotonin syndrome**, which can be fatal. Usually, though, serotonin syndrome is a result of drug interactions. No cases have been observed just from safe, natural approaches\n\n**MDMA, LSD, and other synthetic drugs** may cause serotonin syndrome, and should not be taken without medical supervision or outside a psychotherapeutic environment\n\nMost of the studies mentioned above were performed on adults. More research involving children is needed in order to determine safety.\n\nAbnormally heightened levels of serotonin (hyperserotonemia) is a consistent finding in inpiduals with autism. Pregnant women with hyperserotonemia are more likely to give birth to children with autism\n\n# Drug Interactions\n\nThe use of **St. John‚Äôs Wort, SAMe, or lithium** simultaneously with serotonergic drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I), and triptans, can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening and potentially fatal condition\n\n# Limitations and Caveats\n\nSome of these studies **have fairly small sample sizes**. Additionally, many of these natural methods of increasing serotonin in the body **have only been tested in animals** and need further research in humans through clinical trials.\n\nIn addition to the concentration of serotonin, both the number of serotonin receptors and their sensitivity may also play an integral role in determining serotonin activity.\n\nThough serotonin is mostly made, stored, and released in the gut, serotonin acts as an important neurotransmitter in the brain. Some of these natural remedies and supplements need further testing to determine if they are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Long-term application of these remedies should also be further studied.",

It lasts through workouts, stress wet, you name it. No aluminum, no fragrance, goes on sheer, lasts 48ish hours, lasts through workouts, and washes off without leaving any residue. It ships from  Amsterdam, and I believe they have a money back guarantee if you don‚Äôt end up liking it. If you decided to try it, I highly recommend spending the extra few dollars to add their reusable ‚Äúmagic cap‚Äù to your order. It makes applying the cream so much easier. \n\nOn the days that I don‚Äôt use Nuud, I spritz my pits with **Glycolic Acid by The Ordinary.** This one holds up through workouts and in a pinch, it can remove odor that has already formed. Check the ingredients though because there‚Äôs a sugar derivative in it that might be an issue for you if you have problem with yeast buildup. \n\nCleansing my armpits with **Panoxyl Acne Foaming Wash** has been another game changer. It‚Äôs great at killing bacteria and completely removing odor. The 5% version works fine for me, but they have a 4% for sensitive skin. Massage it into your pits, leave it on while you wash the rest of your body, and rinse off. The benzoyl peroxide in it can bleach fabrics though, so wash your hands after touching it.",

    "body": "Hi sisters, I am new to this community but thank you so much for all the support and inspiration you share here. You are AMAZING!\n\nI am 49 years old and experiencing menopause symptoms for the last 2 years. It has been a wild ride with really really bad and also much better days. Here are some of the things that helped me to get through the hard days and trying to get more of the good ones:  \n\n\n1. **Progress, not perfection.** I put this as the first point for a reason. More often than not we know what's good for ourselves but still end up doing the wrong thing. In these situations, I find it suuper helpful to remind myself - we are all human. Whenever I have crazy mood swings or I end up binge eating junk food - i remind myself - it's okay, i will try to get 1% better, but I won't turn against myself in emotional terror for every mistake I make. Progress, not perfection.\n2. **Nutrition**. Here i stick to \"keep it simple, stupid\" mantra. I try to eat balanced meals and avoid a lot of sugar or too much alcohol. I found that increasing protein-rich foods really helps me to avoid feeling hungry. Also, eating a lot of carbs usually makes me feel sluggish, so whenever I know I will need to be energetic and get things done, I try to avoid having big bowl of pasta for lunch and replace it with more proteins (meat, eggs, tofu or lentils) and fats. If you ever share the same feelings as me - try this out on yourself and see if it helps. For many years i didn't pay too much attention to what I eat, but as i get older, i see how big impact it can leave on my mental and physical state - so don't neglect it. \n3. **Exercise**. The first thing I noticed when doing my research on how to deal with my menopause better, was recommendation to do more exercise. Honestly, I have never been too much into intense exercising in my life. I always somehow managed to keep my weight in check (although I gained few unwanted pounds in last few years :( ). Therefore, I knew I needed something light and easy - otherwise i would give up. I tried to change my lifestyle with small, easy adjustments to increase how much exercise I do. First, I bought myself a low-budget step tracker. I set a goal to have at least 7000 steps per day. Lo and behold, once I started keeping eye on this, I started walking more. I didn't get too obsessed around it, but by simply starting to measure the daily steps, i felt more motivated to walk more. Here are some ideas how to add these extra steps in your daily life: the first tip is a bit silly but it worked for me - get very comfortable walking shoes and outfit. You are much more likely go for a walk if you feel like rockstar while doing it. Another tip - 10-15 minute walk around the neighbourhood before or after work - you will barely notice it! Third, use more stairs - super easy way how to add extra steps without going anywhere you are not supposed to go. \n4. **Sleep**. When I was younger, I didn't care about my sleep schedule at all. I could afford it as my body tolerated a lot more. As i entered menopause, I had to make it my top priority to have a good night sleep. It might sound selfish, but when you think about it - everyone else in your life will be much happier if you feel energetic and refreshed. First, try to stick to a very strict sleeping schedule - go to sleep and wake up the same time every day (+/- 30minutes). It allowed me to fall asleep faster and generally stay asleep during the night more often than when I went to bed whenever I could. Second, what helped me a lot is to have my own bedtime ritual. I don't mean anything esoteric. It simply makes your mind and body associate your sleep with some triggers. Here is an example of my bedtime ritual - I make myself a chamomile tea, turn on a humidifier with lavender oil and read for at least 10-15 minutes. That's it. It gives plenty of signals to my mind that \"oh yes, i see what you're doing - it's bedtime!\". Third, avoid blue screens like plague at least for 1 hour before you start your bedtime ritual. Makes a huge difference.\n5. **Always remember - you are not alone**. Going through all the negative symptoms of menopause like hot flushes, mood swings, and generally feeling like crap can be really hard. However, always remember that you are not alone and there are women all around the world going through the same challenges. Find someone to talk to. The internet has enabled all of us to connect in communities like this where you can find support of like-minded women. It's a real gift that we have this opportunity - don't take it for granted.   \n\n\nHope you find at least something helpful! Remember - progress, not perfection! Stay amazing!\n\nTracy",

Especially at 15 years old when you have yet to accept yourself and discover yourself it‚Äôs really difficult to accept an illness. Once you accept your disease life gets so much easier! \n\nTell yourself that you and only you know your limitations. Just because your neighbor or someone‚Äôs co worker can handle something similar doesn‚Äôt make you weak or less of a person. \n\nYou deserve EVERYTHING everyone else hopes for in life. Tell yourself that every time you drag yourself into the bathroom and hold your stomach crying. Flares can make you feel like so much less of a human. \n\nYou can work? Awesome! You can‚Äôt work? It‚Äôs ok! You‚Äôre still a deserving person and you have purpose. \n\nStop comparing yourself to others and putting yourself down. \n\nRectal medicated enemas are no fun! Before you give it to yourself take the bottle and put it under your arm or behind your leg. Watch a YouTube video to pass time. It will warm up to your body temp. Then tap the bottle and squeeze out the air. Warmer fluid with no air helps you avoid cramping up. \n\nHaving UC is a very humbling experience. Now I can laugh at the job interviews I went to wearing depends. I can laugh at all the times I crapped myself in public - most of all the time everyone heard it and I was wearing a bright red beret hat as to signal ‚Äúhere she is the woman that shit her pants !!‚Äù I lost count of stories of horror. \n\nI currently work from home now and although it‚Äôs not a dream job I have my own bathroom. So I turned my bathroom into a mini jungle. Monstera plants, ferns, exotic flowers. \n\nLose the friends and relationships that don‚Äôt matter. Believe me no one gets through life without some hardship. So if they can‚Äôt bother to be your friend or think you‚Äôd make a bad romantic partner then God help them when shit hits the fan in their life. Pun intended. \n\nEveryone craps. Everyone will crap themselves at some point in their life. The woman with the $100 leggings in the stall next to me sucking her teeth and letting out signs of disgust while listening to my stomach- she will one day know the humbling experience. Think Taco Bell. Let‚Äôs hope she‚Äôs on a date. Better yet let‚Äôs hope she has on those leggings. \n\nSelf care really helps. Wax melts, candles, lavender oil. Nice warm showers. Reminding yourself this is your journey. \n\nAfter I was diagnosed I had to get home schooled from high school sophomore year. I lost all my friends but signed up to write pen pals. All my closest friends live all over the world and we still write and communicate through social media. No worries about restaurants or bars or moments where I‚Äôm not near a bathroom. \n\nHumor is key. Laughter really helps. Obviously when you‚Äôre ready to reflect back. \n\nBeing scared is ok! Hell there are days where I‚Äôm scared still. \n\nHugs to everyone here :) Hold your head up",

    "body": "I‚Äôm the one who posted my ‚ÄúCPTSD Victory‚Äù about reaching two years of no suicidal attempts or ideation since 5/17/17   üéâ \nHere are some of the things that continue to help me maintain progress:\n\n\n[EDIT- Apologies for incomplete sentences, formatting, spelling errors, grammar, etc, especially since I‚Äôve copy/pasted some of this text. I have spent hours on this, so I don‚Äôt feel like proofreading too much. Most of this is from a comment I made in a thread in the aforementioned post, but I‚Äôve added some things to address my panic attacks, intense self-harm urges (I still get them), and hopelessness.]\n\n\n##Keeping A strict routine. \n\nI mean, waking up, working, Netflix-ing, lazy time-ing around the same times of day or same days each week. Including eating the exact same thing the same day of the week. Exercising the same time and days each week. Eventually my metabolism and digestive system got really predictable. \n\nIt‚Äôs a HUGE feeling of relief and self-management that at least *this* part of my existence is steady and predictable. Controllable.\n\n\nI‚Äôve had to learn what kinds of meals and what size of meals work best for ME and sticking to it. \n\n\nAnd by ‚Äúworking for me‚Äù I *do\n not* mean foods that give me a sense of relief or comfort, because I don‚Äôt want to create (or continue) an unhealthy relationship with food. \n\n\nI have to stay conscious about where I am getting my oxytocin / serotonin / dopamine supply, so eating is extremely intentional. Things that take a long time for me to digest, like gluten, heavy casseroles, most dairy, it interrupts my serotonin production in my gut, causing a deficit that leads to suicidal ideation. (This took me *years* to figure out. I don‚Äôt have a gluten or dairy allergy, I have a sensitivity.)  \n\n\nIt‚Äôs effort not to give in to my guilt when someone offers me something I know is going to fuck me up (office birthday cake, potlucks, etc). But I have just gone thru too many cycles of wanting to slit my wrists because of Debbie‚Äôs birthday sheet cake at work two days prior that I‚Äôm actually kind of afraid of certain foods now. Literally poison that could kill me slowly. \n\n\nRecently I got braver about this when I‚Äôm out in restaurants. One of my symptoms of CPTSD is I don‚Äôt get hungry, really. I can go three whole days without actually feeling hungry and getting a craving for something. So instead of pressuring myself to eat lavish, celebratory meals when I have to go out for dinner with friends, I practice checking in with my body and mental state to see what kind of sustenance I *actually* need in the moment. For example, if I go to a steakhouse, And I see they have baked potatoes for sides, I‚Äôll ask for a single baked potato. Or if it‚Äôs a brunch spot, one single egg. I know by now what works best for my mind and body. Every time I‚Äôve tried to do the three-meals-a-day thing it has exacerbated my anxiety, my digestive issues and is a trigger for when my meals were weighed out for me, or I was forced to eat. Maybe someone will think I‚Äôm fussy, but I just can‚Äôt care because........\n\n\n##I have stopped admonishing myself for having a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù attitude. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs that I do not have the capability to care about about certain things to a certain degree anymore, because it‚Äôs detrimental to my mental health. \n\nI have to be choosy about where I direct my attention. *Friend: Did you hear about all those protests downtown? Me: Yeah, I did. And it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not concerned, I just can‚Äôt care about that right now. I‚Äôm in survival mode.*\n\n\n\n##Dealing with Self-harm urges: \n\nIce water. In the throws of a panic attack, ice cold water to the face and hands redirects the brains attention. When we submerge our face and hands in ice-cold water (like in a kitchen sink) our brain thinks we‚Äôre drowning and an automatic survival mode starts up.\n\n\nHmm ... Isn‚Äôt that interesting. That the physical body wants to survive, even when our emotions tell us otherwise. Is it possible to live inside those split-second moments? \n\nLet‚Äôs see. \n\nI‚Äôm having a panic attack, but there‚Äôs no actual threat. I just know I want to hurt myself, or knock myself out. *Plunk* into the water. Thoughts slow down. Suddenly my body responds to what it perceives *is* an actual threat. And its response is to *survive.* \n\n\nThis is the strength they talk about in superhero origin stories. When all is lost, and something inside kicks in. It‚Äôs power. It‚Äôs courage. IT‚ÄôS YOU. ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nSometimes I yell and scream into the water, at everyone and everything who programmed me to flinch in this way. \n\n[PERSONAL NOTE: I‚Äôm allowed to be angry at them, forever. I‚Äôm allowed to never, ever forgive the monsters in my life. Denying them my forgiveness has no bearing on my value, importance or worthiness as a person. *Nor does it impede my ability to love others empathetically and sincerely.* I can hate my abusers and still be a good person. My hate for them is not going to rot me.]\n\n\n##Dealing with Panic attacks: \n\n\nGrounding myself. From where I‚Äôm sitting, I try to name five things I can hear, four things I can smell, three things I can touch, etc. I change this up. Or sometimes, if I‚Äôm having a hard time switching from sense to sense in my panic, I‚Äôll just count as many things as I can hear with my eyes closed. I say them out loud, to hear my voice outside of my skull for a change. My therapist and I made a self-soothe kit for me. It has something for each sense: a swatch of supersoft faux fur, a bottle of lavender oil, gin-gin ginger chews, a little music box thing, and a few really pretty clear blue marbles. I‚Äôll go through each one mindfully. Remember holding marbles up to your eye as a kid? Neither did I until I tried it again. What would be in your Self-Soothe kit?\n\n\n\n##Exercise. \n\nI got an elliptical machine on Craigslist for cheap. I don‚Äôt have to leave my house or deal with people when I need to burn off energy. 20 minutes of cardio helps me sleep through the night. And as I‚Äôve posted in here before, I look and feel 15 years younger due to trauma and memory loss, so perhaps that‚Äôs the universe giving me a do-over! I want my physical health to keep up with how young I feel emotionally. My cat is my trainer.\n\nEdit: My routine is more important to me than trying to top each workout with the next one. The other day I got on my elliptical machine for eleven minutes. Like, 0.3 miles. And I practiced being okay with that. I even made a point to post a victory post on IG about it with my ‚Äòstats.‚Äô 11 min / 0.3 mi / 170 cal. It‚Äôs important to me that I count these smaller steps as victories and progress, not just the big strides. It makes it easier to appreciate the tiny bits of progress in all other areas of my life. \n\n\n##Scaling down my social circle. \n\nI used to work in theatre and performing arts, and was constantly trying to fit every party, every event and play, every coffee date, every vacation, every road trip, every camping weekend into every spare second of my life. I was a workaholic, topping out at about 80 hours a week sometimes. After my last suicidal attempt, I wasn‚Äôt well enough to meet up with anyone, or work more than 30 hours a week. 99% of my friends and family faded away, sometimes out of resentment towards me for being ‚Äúflaky‚Äù or not reciprocating their friendship in a way I wish I could. Now that it‚Äôs been two years, I‚Äôm realizing that maybe I‚Äôve gotten better *because* I shouldn‚Äôt be working more than that. I feel a sense of stability *because* I don‚Äôt socialize nearly as much as I used to. I have self-forgiveness for not being well enough or having the right programming to sustain many close friendships. SELF FORGIVENESS. The ones that stuck around are my fucking *family* now. And it feels so good to understand what Family is *supposed* to be, and that I have some. I‚Äôve *had some all along.* I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the flowers, if I hadn‚Äôt gotten rid of all the weeds. \n\n\n##my timeline is unconventional. \n\nAt my age I‚Äôm obviously not going to have the traditional college-marriage-kids-career plan that so many of my peers do. Or ANY plan, for that matter. I‚Äôve had to remove myself from friends, or social circles that cause me to have negative conversations with myself about this. *This includes social media accounts.* It‚Äôs not that they are bad people. I just need to feel represented within my environment, and I realized that I get to choose that environment. Sure, I‚Äôve had people not understand why I‚Äôm fading out of their group, but I *can‚Äôt* care about what they think about me. It‚Äôs a slippery slope for me. (My truest friends have understood this, and do not write me off when I feel strong enough to hang out again. Unconditional love, yo.)\n\n\n##Dealing with feeling suicidal: \n\nWhen I‚Äôm in the throes of it, I have to force myself into the reality of what is *really* going on: \n\n*I have an illness that causes me to see and feel things that aren‚Äôt real, INCLUDING MY ASSESSMENT OF MYSELF.*\n\nI am emotionally hallucinating. \n\n\nI repeat this silently to myself. I‚Äôll write it on something permanent, in Sharpie. I admit I‚Äôve tagged bathroom stalls with this statement. \n\nI think of people who are having a difficult night with their cancer, or lupus, or MS, or fibromyalgia: *god damn it- this fucking illness wants me dead. Fuck this illness. It‚Äôs the illness not me that wants me dead.* This thought oscillates with *I fucking wish I was dead* but the point is that it keeps oscillating. I fucking wish I was dead- no wait- it‚Äôs this illness that wants me dead and that should piss me off. \n\nIf I can move the feeling of deep shame into anger towards the things that‚Äôs making me feel the deep shame, I‚Äôve leveled up. I‚Äôve accepted it, but I‚Äôve stepped just outside of it. \n\n\n[PERSONAL NOTES] In moments when I‚Äôm violently suicidal, like, pretty much psychosis, I keep screens in front of me. Again, I know this is unconventional advice, lol. But I‚Äôm remembering back to when my ex husband first discarded me and how I literally couldn‚Äôt come out from under my bed for a week. I had my iPad playing twitch streams on one side of me, and reruns of Girls playing on my phone on the other side, at all times, for a week.  \n\nI must have texted someone to come help me, but I had no recollection of it until a friend of a friend who I barely knew showed up at my house with a small bag of groceries. I couldn‚Äôt eat, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. If I tore my eyes away from tv for a second, the darkest most painful thoughts and images would creep in. I‚Äôd made this little fort under my loft bed that made it look like my room was empty, if anyone were to come in. I literally needed to disappear into a different space. \n\nBefore this last time, I would feel suicidal, but not to the point of being so physically drained.   Before I could run to the bathroom and grab a box of pills, or get a box cutter and ‚Äî before my suicidal moments had had energy. This last time, I felt like I had been in an MMA fight. I physically couldn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt even make pee, I didn‚Äôt need to use the bathroom for days. I physically lost the ability to care for myself. \n\nLike a baby. I had made myself a crib, complete with a mobile. \n\nI needed to love myself like a baby. And you know what? THAT‚ÄôS OKAY. It kept me alive. This was my first foray into self-forgiveness. \n\nBecause I got thru that, I knew it was very  possible that it could happen again, and that if it did, I might not be as lucky. I‚Äôm only getting better and better at trying to die. \n\n*I need treat my urge to hurt or kill myself like it‚Äôs an addiction.* \n\nThis is why I sometimes say I‚Äôve ‚Äúbeen in recovery for two years.‚Äù The urges come up daily, and I have to acknowledge them without indulging them. It‚Äôs a conscious, step-by-step, one-day-at-a-time thing that is my priority. *Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,* etc etc etc. That prayer applies here too. \n\n\n##Prepare for those dark times.\n\n\nPut things you‚Äôd genuinely want to do if you weren‚Äôt feeling so low on your calendar. Write them in when you think of them when you‚Äôre feeling well, so they‚Äôre there when you‚Äôre too dissociated or sad-sick to brainstorm ideas. Treat Yo‚Äôself! When I was fresh out of the hospital, one of the things my therapist suggested is planning fun things for myself and literally write them on a physical calendar, where I‚Äôd have to see it all the time. This was in May 2017, so I remember getting online and looking up what bands were touring in my area. I bought a single Thundercat ticket, a single Bonobo ticket, a single tickets to see some stand up comedy, etc. The shows were all in September/October, so whenever I had really dark moments I‚Äôd inevitably think to myself ‚ÄúOk well you can‚Äôt die because then you‚Äôll miss Thundercat.‚Äù And it doesn‚Äôt have to be things that cost money. I‚Äôve written ‚Äúbring lunch to the park‚Äù on a calendar, and somehow the anticipation makes it feel like a real outing when that day arrives. \n\n\n##Netflix\n\n‚Äî Did you know you can still add dvds-in-the-mail like old school style? After the hospital and after I got into my new apartment, it was one of the first things I did for myself. Everyone loves getting mail. What better mail than a movie you‚Äôve been wanting to see? And it‚Äôs automatic plans with yourself, a distraction if needed. The app that is used to queue the movies I want is now a detailed list of films, subjects, creative styles that I like. (More on the necessity of lists below.)  I have to say, it‚Äôs a great feeling to see that red envelope sticking out of my mailbox. It‚Äôs like having instant plans, with no pressure, no additional people needed. \n\n\n##Taking baths \n\n-or a long hot shower at least once a day. Psychologically it feels like being hugged. Then you realize that this is a way you can hug yourself, and it‚Äôs kind of lonely and sad, but it‚Äôs also gratifying and self-sufficient. Remembering to shower seems like a given, but there are days when I don‚Äôt even have enough oxytocin to do that. \n\n\nOn that same note, making myself a cup of hot chocolate or tea with intention (like, drag the chair to the window, find the softest blanket, *then* get the tea and bundle up with only the window to watch - oh what a good time for a grounding exercise. How many things can you hear? See?) If you had the perfectest mom or grandma, what would she do for you when you‚Äôre feeling small and sad? Do that for yourself. I am my own parent. I mean, I‚Äôve been my own parent my whole life, I‚Äôm just not always mad about it anymore. Sometimes I‚Äôm grateful.\n\n\n##Making lists of things I like. \n\nJust lists. Shows I‚Äôm currently into. Fashions. Books I should read. Movies I should watch. It helps so, so much when I‚Äôm dissociated.  I just wander around my apartment, reading all my lists. My dissociation can often be so dense that I can‚Äôt remember any details about my own personality. I can‚Äôt remember favorite *anythings* so  my lists help bring me back to earth. \n\nMaking a permanent list of my favorite foods and keeping it on the fridge. Have you ever had to go grocery shopping while dissociated? Yeah. Super useful. Also great for when someone wants to help you out and shop for you.\n\n##Spotify. \n\nMaking different playlists for myself. For different moods or occasions or exercise, etc. I spent 20 years of my life having no idea what music I liked. I‚Äôd forget what bands or songs were my favorite. What was that album I played on repeat last month because I couldn‚Äôt get enough of it? Fuck if I know. Like with foods, I don‚Äôt retain this kind of self-knowledge about music. And I‚Äôm a musician. SELF-FORGIVENESS. I can‚Äôt care that my brain doesn‚Äôt hold this stuff. That‚Äôs what post-it‚Äôs are for.\n\n\n##Accepting my depression. \n\nI have friends who legit suffer from deep depression, some who have ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô from it. At 42, I have accepted that I‚Äôm not going to recover from the kind I have. Mine is tangled in with CPTSD. So instead of beating myself up because my deep sadness is never really 100% gone, I just keep adding fun and happy things to my plate. I no longer spend so much energy trying to escape being sad. I just add more happy. \n\n\n##Accepting my depression in the moment. \n\nIf I‚Äôm sad, I let myself feel sad. I tell my work that I‚Äôm ‚Äúsick‚Äù and call in, because I AM. If I had an autoimmune disease, I‚Äôd have to take extra measures to prevent getting a cold, because my cold could last weeks longer than an average person‚Äôs. So:\n\n##I have an autoimmune disease of the emotional mind. Therefore, I am prone to emotional illnesses more often than others,  they can last longer than they do for others, and they can become lethal if not managed.\n\nExplaining it this way to myself and to others has helped redefine my mental illness. I treat myself differently than I used to when my depression gets bad. I‚Äôm *kinder* to myself, like when I have the flu. Trying to push through like normal is a definite trigger for shame becoming suicidal ideation for me. If I was in remission from a cancer that almost killed me, no one would judge me for not wanting to run a half-marathon. \n\n\n##SELF ACCEPTANCE. \n\n##I understand that i have a condition that literally keeps me from seeing all of myself accurately. So when someone tells me I‚Äôm amazing, I kind of have to believe them, even when I am in the depths of despair. \n\nThat feeling of worthlessness? Dispair? Self-hate? Wanting to fucking die?\n\nI try to work on moving from feeling worthless to *being pissed off that i have a disease that makes me feel worthless.* First I say it out loud, even if I don‚Äôt believe it yet. Then I think it internally, word for word. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm angry at this disease. I‚Äôm angry at my abusers for injuring me in this way. I‚Äôm angry.‚Äù That‚Äôs what *working on it* means to me. \n\nShame has lethargy, but anger has *energy.* Gets the blood pumping. I‚Äôll go for a walk, clean my house, workout, or write a bunch, or take a sandwich to the park. I‚Äôll go to a $5 movie alone. Or the library. I‚Äôll work an extra work shift. Something that uses physical energy. I use that energy in a positive way because that‚Äôs the ultimate revenge on my past abuse and subsequent illnesses. This might not be conventional advice, but the people who write the books of CPTSD usually don‚Äôt have it, so I‚Äôm dedicated to coming up with methods on my own.\n\nProgress is not a straight line. Often, it‚Äôs not even a line, it‚Äôs a loopy-loop chutes-n-ladders path, and all my pieces are from candyland. But if I count one space at a time, and accept the setbacks as part of the journey, I know I‚Äôll be okay.\n\n\nFor those with access to therapy, or similar I recommend DBT (dialectal behavioral therapy) courses to help sort out emotional reactions to past, present and future conditions. Originally designed for Borderline Personality Disorder, it has really helped me slow down my emotional ‚Äúflinching,‚Äù and helped me prioritize my actual needs vs. my emotional needs. My reasonable reactions from my emotional reactions. \nFor those who don‚Äôt, I started with free therapy programs thru the graduate programs at my local college. I discovered free trauma counseling through calling crisis lines as well, and I joined a few depression/anxiety groups on the MeetUp app. I also recommend the Mood Tracker app for self-observance and a great support system, and the Breathe Player app for focused breathing. \n\n\n##I will continue to add more to this as time goes by.\n\nPlease feel free to spread this around as needed. These are all things I wish I had started doing for myself decades ago.\n\nI just add things to it as I come up with them, and I must be doing something right because at 42, I finally feel like I‚Äôm moving forward, I‚Äôm not stuck. \n\n\nKind of like.... I finally invented a bike that I can ride after having both legs blown off in a war. I‚Äôll never be able to pretend I have legs, I‚Äôll always look down and be reminded of my pain and trauma‚Äî if I decide to look down. The point is I‚Äôm moving forward, so I have to focus on that. And also, *i made the bike* so I‚Äôm entitled to quietly feel like I‚Äôm a better at being a person than others who didn‚Äôt have to invent their own bikes. If that makes sense!\n\n\nI hope this helps some of you find some love inside yourselves. This community has really given me a safe place to land, and I appreciate you guys so, so much. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è\n\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold!!!! Seeing no ads does make a difference to sensitive souls like us. I‚Äôm very grateful!!!",

    "body": "Something is wrong with my roommate. Like, something REALLY wrong. I don‚Äôt want to even go back to our dorm, but I don‚Äôt want to leave her alone either. I‚Äôm worried she had, or will have, a breakdown or something.\n\nOk so some background would help, I guess:\n\n\nMy roommate. She‚Äôs a quiet, shy physical therapy major. She‚Äôs a bit of a nerd, Dean‚Äôs list every semester and all, and I think it‚Äôs because she needs the scholarships so bad. She gets SUPER anxious around finals week each semester, and I hate myself a bit for loving that so much. Because that sweet mousy little thing has a mouth like a fucking sailor, ESPECIALLY when she‚Äôs nervous about something. Our first semester together, I was terrified of, I don‚Äôt know, breaking her or something. I wouldn‚Äôt even bring my friends around because I was worried they‚Äôd be too loud and make her cry. Then a week before the semester ends, I come into our dorm to this:\n\n‚ÄúYou donkey-fucking piece of SHIT!! Why the fucking Christ would you decide to break now, you cunt! (she was addressing our printer) Fucking hell, and what shithead twat of a professor assigns a research paper over 3 motherfucking days??!! I swear to god, I SWEAR to GOD if I see that pompous shithead anywhere outside of campus later I‚Äôm going to rip out his tongue and shove it up his own asshole. Then I‚Äôll skullfuck his WIFE with a fucking dildo MADE out of this goddamn paper and MAKE HIM WATCH!!‚Äù\n\n\nSo yeah, she has a bit of a mouth on her. It‚Äôs hilarious. And adorable.\n\nI think she‚Äôs lonely too. She never talks about her family. Besides me, I don‚Äôt think she has any real friends. Lord knows she never dates. I think she likes the solitude. She loves to hike and read and watch trashy reality shows, and I guess that‚Äôs enough for her. I‚Äôve tried to get her out of her shell a little, take her to parties and all, but I can just tell she‚Äôs miserable. Whatever, sometimes it‚Äôs fun, just her and me hanging out in the quiet.\n\nShe‚Äôs also serious. I can‚Äôt make that girl laugh for anything. You know that one episode of Scrubs, where JD dates that girl who keeps saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so funny!‚Äù but not actually laughing? She‚Äôs like that, only she‚Äôll say it with a TOTALLY straight face. It took me a while to realize that she was serious, and not being a sarcastic little bitch, when she said it. \n\n\nI...I‚Äôm kind of hesitant to write this part, because if feels like, I don‚Äôt know, invading her privacy? But I think it‚Äôs important. I think something really bad happened to her when she was a kid. She NEVER talks about it or anything, but sometimes she just looks so, I guess, haunted? She has nightmares to sometimes, terrible ones. She doesn‚Äôt even scream, that‚Äôs the worst part, she just cries in her sleep and whimpers. When I wake her up, I think I do it for my sake as much as hers; I can‚Äôt stand to see her like that. And...she has scars. I‚Äôve seen them on her back when she was changing after a shower. I‚Äôve asked, but she literally BEGS me not to talk about it, and I just can‚Äôt make it worse for her. When she wants to talk, she knows I‚Äôm here.\n\nAnyway, that‚Äôs the roommate I left last week to visit my aunt. She was worried and pale (poor thing kept losing her stuff) but she was HER. I came back this afternoon and‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt fucking know what to think. I was raised methodist, but I‚Äôve never really believed in angels and demons and all that shit before, you know? Until now at least.\n\nSo I get to our dorm room, and she‚Äôs just STANDING there in the dark. I thought, whatever, I just caught her waking up from a nap or something, and she was still a little out of it. So I went in to hug her (she‚Äôs not a SUPER touchy-feely person, but fuck it, I‚Äôm a hugger, and I thought she was starting to get used to it) and she fucking backs up so fast she hit the wall. Like, her head audibly CRACKED against it, but she didn‚Äôt even wince. She said in this dead voice ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me‚Äù, like she was pissed or something, but the thing is, she was smiling the whole time. \n\nI thought maybe she wsas having a shitty day or something, so I thought I would just let it go. I started to unpack my bag and put my stuff away, and I was talking the whole time, just to make it less awkward, about my trip. She was still just standing against the wall, doing nothing. Fucking weird. \n\nSo I‚Äôm talking about my plane ride, and I guess I said ‚Äúfuck‚Äù or something (if you couldn‚Äôt tell, I swear sometimes) and all of the sudden she‚Äôs crossing the room to my side, CRAZY fast, and shouts ‚ÄúDO NOT SWEAR!!‚Äù. I have never heard this girl raise her voice in the 2 and a half years I knew her. I fucking stammer out this apology, but she‚Äôs already walking back to her side of the room. She CROUCHES on her bed, not sits, crouches like an animal or something, and her face goes slack. Except for that goddamn smile. And then, she may has well have been a mannequin. I try to talk to her, I call her name like six goddamn times. I know she hears me, but she just stays in that position, staring off into space. I couldn‚Äôt stand it. I couldn‚Äôt just be in the room with her like that and pretend things were normal. I say I‚Äôm going to a study group and grab my purse and leave. I don‚Äôt know if she heard me or not. I think...I think her smile got just a bit wider.\n\nSo that was about 4 this afternoon. Now it‚Äôs 1:30. I‚Äôm in the library, and I‚Äôm scared to go back. What if she‚Äôs still there, in that exact same position? What the FUCK do I do? Does anyone have any experience with shit like this?? I‚Äôm DESPERATE; how do I help her?\n\n**********************************************************\nEdit: Fucking Hell. Someone linked me to a post that shares a creepy amount of details with what I'm going through.  I don't want to believe in this shit, but the posts mention Erica and I BY NAME!! And the second post, I just....I can't fucking handle this tonight. I can't go back to our dorm room, not knowing what I know now; I'm crashing my boyfriend's place tonight. I'm going to get to the goddamn bottom of this tomorrow. I just hope Erica will be ok tonight\n\n. \n\n***********************************************************\n**Edit (2):** Ok, I got a lot of really helpful comments; thank you guys so much. A lot of people said she was possessed. I don't know, if someone tried to tell me that a week ago, I'd have laughed my fucking ass off. But know, I just don't know. Erica isn't in our room; she must be in class. I'm so scared for her. I'm scared OF her. But I'm not going to give up on her\n\n*\n\nso, I kept getting links to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2okzzj/i_lost_my_keys_last_week_and_im_going_to_die/?sort=new) post and to it's follow up. I read them both (even though the second one made my fucking skin crawl) and I learned a lot I never knew about my roommate. Jesus Christ, no WONDER she never talks about her childhood. So here's what we know:\n\n- she was raised in some kind of cult led by a fuckwit named Daniel\n- she has some kind of retroactive anmesia or some shit about the cult\n- she and her mom escaped when she was 12\n- something changed in her mom when she was 14\n- she was feeling like shit for about a week before all this, and I didn't fucking notice\n- 2 nights ago, something happened to her\n- Erica NEVER uses \"text talk\" or emoticons, so that second entry is seriously FUCKED.\n\n*\n\nOK, not a lot to go on, but it's a start. I started doing some research and HOLY FUCK look what I found!\n\n*\n\n[Daniel Wilburn Layne](http://www.culteducation.com/group/970-church-of-god-restoration.html) founded this Church of God Restoration. LOOK at all this shit. Child abuse? Kids fucking DYING?? What the fuck did this monster do to Erica? Here are some of the beliefs of his 'church':\n\n- corporal punishment of children\n- seperation from the world through actions\n- faith healing\n- **unification of the children of God in one body**\n\nDo you think this is the guy was the one Erica was talking about? Here's the thing though: people are thinking he took over Erica's mom when she was a kid. But he didn't die until 2011, when Erica's mom \"changed\" in 2010. Do you think he can take more than one body at a time?\n\n*\n\nFucking shit. I wonder where Erica is. Jesus, please don't let him hurt her anymore.\n\n***************\n**Edit:** : I'm back at the dorm, no sign of Erica. She's answering her phone. Should I go out and try to find her?\n\n***************\n\n*\n\nEDIT: Sorry, everyone! I know it's been a while. I've been busy. I couldn't find a priest willing to perform an exorcism, but I got all the supplies I think I'll need. I'm ending this tonight. I finally [heard back from Erica](http://imgur.com/2L5h9Zg),  over Reddit (of all things).\n\n*\n\nI'm not letting this FUCKING THING have her. This is ending as soon as she comes home.\n\n*****************\n\nEDIT: C/P from comments:\n\n\n\nThis is my last post for tonight. Erica is in the dorm. The problem is, I have no idea how she got here. In fact, it‚Äôs physically impossible for her to be here, but she is.\nI came back to the dorm around 7:30 tonight, after going around to various religious and spiritual friends and visiting a Catholic church to get the items for the exorcism. Since then, the door has been locked. I can see it from my bed, where I‚Äôve been the whole evening. It‚Äôs a small fucking room, I would have heard the door open. Our bathroom is right next to the entrance door. I‚Äôve gone to the bathroom twice this evening. Not that you care about my bathroom habits, but it‚Äôs important. Because I just went to go to the bathroom and I saw this.\n\n*\n\n[Image](http://i.imgur.com/7YFsXqh.jpg)\n\n\nShe won‚Äôt look up. She won‚Äôt answer me.\n\n\nI know there are those of you who think all this is bullshit; that Erica is just schizophrenic or otherwise disturbed and that I should call her a doctor. I‚Äôll admit, I thought that was a possibility. But there is literally no explanation for this. There is no way, NO FUCKING WAY she could been in that bathroom!! She was not here when I came back and she never walked through the DAMN DOOR!!\n\n*\n\nI‚Äôm done posting for the night; I‚Äôm done fucking around. I‚Äôm going to do the exorcism, and this is going to fucking END!! I‚Äôll update you on the situation tomorrow.\n\n\n*************\n\n**Final Edit:** I just realized I haven't been dating this. To clarify, the events in this post began Monday afternoon when I came back from vacation. I spent Monday night at the library and my boyfriend's dorm, and came back yesterday (Tuesday) morning, to find Erica gone. She was missing the entirety of Tuesday until I found her in the bathroom last night around nine pm. Except for the text message she sent and the Reddit conversation we had, I have no idea where she was or what she was doing.\n\n*\n\nIn the time Erica was missing, I did as much research as I could from the limited information I had from both her personally, and from her earlier posts. I know enough about her past to know she was hurt badly, she escaped, and something was following her. I never found her mother. If she's alive, I hope she's free. If not, I sincerely hope that she's dead. I've seen up close what this thing does to you when it's inside you; what it does to your mind. I can't imagine a worse HELL.\n\n*\n\nSo, the exorcism. I didn't see until too late that the sage I got was all wrong, but oh well, I thought I'd do the best with what I had. Since Erica wouldn't move, I went into the bathroom to do the ritual there. I started with burning the white candles and saying some of the prayers you guys recommended. It laughed at me. Erica's face was still down and covered by her hair, but it was laughing quietly just the same. For the first time since this fucking NIGHTMARE began, I was more angry than scared or worried. How dare it?? How DARE it take my Erica and destroy her like this??! Worst, I thought, and maybe it was my imagination, that I could here HER underneath the laugh. Not screaming, like I would have thought, but fucking sobbing. She sounded just like she used to sound when she had nightmares.\n\nI was livid at this point, so I took the hoy water, and fucking THREW it as hard at that thing in the tub. The glass shattered, and holy water dripped all over Erica's body. It stopped laughing then. It stopped laughing fast.\n\n*\n\nWhat happened next was so fast that I can barely remember exactly what happened. It screeched, it crossed the room, and it slammed me against the wall. My feet were actually off the ground. Erica is a tiny bit of a thing and I'm way bigger, so this should have been impossible. But at this point I stopped expecting things to be possible. She started to choke me. She, IT, looked at me, and I thought \"this is it. I'm going to go insane right now, and no one can save Erica then.\" When it looked me in the eyes, I saw madness and hilarity and hatred and animal rabidness, all at once. And it was STILL. FUCKING. SMILING. How did Erica live with something like that for FOUR years, and stay sane?? Hell, maybe she didn't.\n\nSo it's got me by the throat, and my vision is going out. I thought I was going to die by the hands of my sweet roommate who stepped around ants on the the sidewalk and apologized to spiders she found in our room and had to take outside.\n\nI don't know if it was luck or God that saved me, that saved US. At this point, it was probably God, and if so I'll spend the rest of my life praying in gratitude. The rosary beads were still wrapped around my wrist. When I punched Erica with it in my fist (oh GOD Erica, I'm so so sorry), it let me go and was thrown back. Erica's nose was bleeding now, whether from her anemia or something else, and it was woozy and unsettled and glaring at me hatefully. With the prayers, as well as the rest of the holy water, some lavender oil, the candles, the bible, and the (probably useless) sage, I completed the ritual for the exorcism. I really think I did it right. When Erica looked at me again, her eyes were brown again, and she was crying. Not smiling, thank god, not fucking smiling. She let me touch her again. She let me take her hand, and lead her to bed. I didn't ask any questions and niether did she, but she did whisper \"thank you.\" And that was enough.\n\n*\n\nShe's asleep now. I don't think it hurt her while it was inside her, she doesn't have any marks or bruises beyond the one I had to give her. I don't know when she'll wake up, but I hope her sleep is dreamless. I don't know what had her: if it was Daniel, or her mother, or something else. I don't know WHAT it's goal was in taking some random girl who never hurt anyone and making her life hell. But then, I don't know why Daniel did the same thing to all those people in his cult. Power, maybe, or sadism. Who knows? I'm just glad it's finally over\n\n-----Catherine :)\n",

In fact, it‚Äôs physically impossible for her to be here, but she is.\n\nI came back to the dorm around 7:30 tonight, after going around to various religious and spiritual friends and visiting a Catholic church to get the items for the exorcism. Since then, the door has been locked. I can see it from my bed, where I‚Äôve been the whole evening. It‚Äôs a small fucking room, I would have heard the door open. Our bathroom is right next to the entrance door. I‚Äôve gone to the bathroom twice this evening. Not that you care about my bathroom habits, but it‚Äôs important. Because I just went to go to the bathroom and I saw this.\n\n[Image](http://i.imgur.com/7YFsXqh.jpg)\n\nShe won‚Äôt look up. She won‚Äôt answer me.\n\nI know there are those of you who think all this is bullshit; that Erica is just schizophrenic or otherwise disturbed and that I should call her a doctor. I‚Äôll admit, I thought that was a possibility. But there is literally no explanation for this. There is no way, NO FUCKING WAY she could been in that bathroom!! She was not here when I came back and she never walked through the DAMN DOOR!!\n\nI‚Äôm done posting for the night; I‚Äôm done fucking around.

Double score, but I knew it would happen sooner or later.\n\nIt‚Äôs 930pm Friday, I‚Äôm in my part of the house, half naked, pretty stoned and trying to relax with an incoming migraine. Then I hear the front door. She tried to open it, and it was locked. For some reason she tried again, let out a huge audible sigh that I heard from downstairs, and rang the door bell impatiently... but she had her keys in her hand? Thia Toula let her in, and I put on a smile like it‚Äôs showtime to go and greet her. After some shockingly pleasant small talk, she catches on to me having a wicked headache. She immediately starts on the essential oils and guilt trips, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid to ask if you‚Äôd want to put lavender oil on your forehead because I know you hate it and don‚Äôt Believe In Them‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. But I‚Äôm only trying to heeeeelp!‚Äù. At this point I hadn‚Äôt said anything even remotely sassy or even in a tone. I said ‚Äúno but thank you for offering‚Äù in the most sickeningly sweet tone and she huffed up the stairs. Cool, exchange finished I can retreat and take off these pants again.\n\n\nThen 730 this morning happened. She was in the bathroom, door opened and turned on the loudest blow dryer known to mankind. It‚Äôs high pitch swooshing made all the dogs in the block howl in grief and some say there was noise pollution out on the countryside because of this dryer. Then she starts singing to herself, again, 730, door opened, Saturday morning, everyone asleep. \n\nI try my best to ignore, because as much as I hate it, I know it‚Äôs not ‚Äúdirected‚Äù at anyone. She‚Äôs just that loud and inconsiderate. \n\nNow it‚Äôs 9am, she‚Äôs already started and yelled/whined/given heavy sass in Greek to my Thia, turned on the TV, and had the kitchen sink running for dishes for 30 mins now. She‚Äôs stomping around because she can only hobble from being so inactive, she‚Äôs turned up the tv to hear over the running water, and she speaks louder than the tv to discuss what‚Äôs in Tv with Thia. \n\nNothing directed at me, yet I‚Äôm still the one pissed of and with a headache, without sleep and super tired. \n\nSERENITY NOW!\n\nOmg there‚Äôs an update already, it‚Äôs only been 15 minutes;\n\nMIL was REARRANGING FURNITURE. DH ran upstairs with a whisper yell ‚Äúyo! Wtf are you doing? She‚Äôs sleeping! Do this later on, what‚Äôs your problem?!‚Äù.... I know he reacted that way cause he‚Äôs half asleep, but I just messaged him saying thank you\n\n\n2nd update; DH is out and I won‚Äôt see him until tomorrow. My brain is still very angry and I‚Äôm sleep deprived. Both MIL and Thia(Aunt in law) are in the phone, a floor and a floor and a half away. Doors closed.

Because it was useful to me doesn‚Äôt mean it will be useful to you\n\nI have been anxious since the eight grade. It was mostly depression but it was all psychological and never physical until 4 months ago it became physical and it scarred me. I still experience it some time to time. For some it could be an upset stomach for others it could be being light headed, feeling numb, tightness on the chest, not able to be breathe, trembling, shaking. For me it is chest ache which is among the worst scenario because i always thought i was going to die so i went to a cardiologist and I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with anything but he did prescribe me antidepressants and told me to get some pain killers. Pain killers obviously didn‚Äôt work since it was all in my head and I couldn‚Äôt control it so the painkiller didn‚Äôt have any job to do because itself couldn‚Äôt detect what was hurting. Trust me i have tried everything! Breathing techniques, the 5 game, focusing on something else. Not one worked or it worked for a little amount of time. By the way i have scoliosis so i was so sure that it was something medical. After i was diagnosed with intense trauma and chronic stress I thought ‚Äòokay you know what they say if you can feel it you can control it‚Äô but I couldn‚Äôt. I literally tried to trick my brain to not to think about it and it made everything much worse.\n\n1) Think ‚Äòthis is normal. Everyone is having difficulties so why is it only happening to me?‚Äô It isn‚Äôt. I am sure there are lots of millions other people who experience the same thing like i do right this second. Some people had it for years and years and have to deal with it every day. Instead do this. Relax your entire body and stop your thoughts. Let it flow. You can be like you were before. You really can. One day you will wake up and never feel the physical symptoms anymore.\n\n2) if you can‚Äôt control it what can you do? You can minimize the damage. You are aware that it‚Äôs going to last for a couple of hours so don‚Äôt really think about it\n\n3) drink tea. Especially herbal tea\n\n4) sniff or put lavender oil on the hurting area it will relax you\n\n5) dont search for ‚Äòhow to stop anxiety‚Äô. I did this a lot and caused myself more worry. Treat is as it will be gone soon\n\n6) reduce the amount of cigarettes and alcohol/caffeine. Cigarettes only work because you take deep breaths\n\n7) even if you don‚Äôt feel like it go out. I am very antisocial and like to spend most of my time inside but it‚Äôs not always good. Go out for a day and then don‚Äôt as long as you don‚Äôt want but at least go out\n\n8) fresh air is important. Try to stand near a window everytime you have anxiety and observe what you see\n\n9) don‚Äôt procrastinate. Ngl i still do but it‚Äôs not good\n\n10) clean the house. It really distracts you.\n\nI will post more after i try other things that work but for now just know that you are not alone and everyone feels that sometimes. We just tend to face it differently.\n\nPART 2 IS OUT IF IT HELPS",

    "body": "I dined at Kadeau for their Preservation Season menu the night after Jordn√¶r. This was the second of a three-night dining frenzy I had planned and after Jordn√¶r, I really wondered how any place would top it. Regardless, it was only right that I went in with an open mind and made sure I showed up prepared (aka famished) having racked up the steps the entire day by exploring every possible corner of the city I could on foot.\n\nWhen making the reservation here, there really wasn‚Äôt much to go by online about the restaurant. I had seen the odd comment on CPH threads on here about folks who had eaten here touting it as a must-try fine dining option in the city, which piqued my interest. The concept of their Preservation Season also seemed intriguing. I also wanted to see what distinguished the 2\\*s in the city from the 3\\*. The choice paid off because I was amazed by the mastery of ingredients here and I consider this an utterly unique menu. No other restaurant to me has conveyed a stronger sense of place than Kadeau.\n\n  \n**The Space:**\n\n  \nUpon ringing the bell at the front door, one of the head chefs greeted me and led me to my table that has unofficially been designated as the table for solo diners. This truly is a beautiful dining room ‚Äì spacious, dimly lit, and intimate with large windows on one side overlooking a courtyard. From my table, I had a great view of the massive open kitchen. (Pic #2)\n\n  \n**The Food:**\n\n  \nMost, if not all, of the ingredients at Kadeau come from the island of Bornholm, the home of Kadeau (also has the original 1\\* restaurant there) and a quick flight or a half-day ferry ride away from Copenhagen. Everything that grows in Bornholm during the summer is used for the menu during the Growing season and a good chunk of it is preserved away to highlight the Preservation Season menu. This place exemplifies hyper local cooking and is the consummate representation of the produce on the island. While Jordn√¶r showers you with extravagance ‚Äì mounds of caviar, black truffle, langoustine, etc. ‚Äì I so admire the intentional handicap that the chefs at Kadeau are working with ‚Äì we cook with whatever grows on the island and little else.\n\nKadeau feels unique in their mastery. It‚Äôs unlike any menu I‚Äôve had before with such intelligent use of ingredients, pretty much every dish here making me ponder ‚Äì ‚Äúhow do they think of this?‚Äù. At the end of it all, the meal felt surprisingly light (relative to most tasting menus) but also did not leave me feeling like I needed more food. While I‚Äôve provided pictures of all dishes and each one was excellent, some of my favorites are below:  \n\n\n1) *Last summer‚Äôs tomatoes (Pic #3)* ‚Äì first bite of the meal. Now, I know tomatoes can be a controversial ingredient but I f-ing love them. This was as perfect a start to a tasting as I‚Äôve had anywhere. Intensely sweet, preserved tomatoes packed in tiny parcels with pickled elements and a refreshingly sweet and tart sauce. I loved every single bite of this.\n\n2) *Scallop and squid toast* *(Pic #5)* ‚Äì a tartlet with a mosaic of raw scallop and squid. This also had a secret ingredient underneath ‚Äì ants. While the idea may feel uneasy for some, they added a nice salinity and almost citrus flavor to the sweetness of the raw seafood. Really beautiful bite.\n\n3) *Oysters with havgus cheese (Pic #7)* ‚Äì this was probably the richest single bite on the menu. Oysters served swimming in a meuniere style sauce topped with a melty Danish cheese. A really creamy and intensely satisfying bite, one of my favorites of the night.\n\n4) *Dried vegetables, ham and rhubarb root (Pic #9)* ‚Äì another little tartlet, this beauty was also one of my favorites combining vegetables like carrot and beetroot on top with ham and rhubarb root underneath. Sweet, salty, earthy ‚Äì really enjoyable bite.\n\n5) *Hot and cold smoked salmon with lavender* *(Pics #11, 12, 13)* ‚Äì the highlight of the menu for me and I believe something of a signature for the restaurant. They first present an entire filet of salmon that has been smoked for days on end and served two different ways. The first, uses the belly of the salmon that lies beneath the skin, which does not receive the brunt of the smoke and thus has a more delicate smoked flavor. The second, a tiny sliver of the top layer of the belly that is in more direct contact with the smoke, served alongside three different pickled fruit. A seemingly simple serving of food but one that has been prepared with incredible effort and patience. In the first dish, creamy, fatty, gently smoky salmon with a slice of grilled onion on top and a lavender oil ‚Äì the addition of that onion, with its sweetness but slight astringency, made this dish. The second bite hits you with more aggressive smoke flavor but balanced nicely with the pickles. Overall, this was an intelligent dish with incredible restraint ‚Äì every ingredient served its purpose perfectly to complement the fish.\n\n6) *Wild grey duck with preserves (Pic #15 and #16)* ‚Äì I just want to shout out this dish because they serve duck **that they shot themselves!** Perfectly cooked duck with a delightful piece of duck heart, and a morsel of duck leg. This was served with an array of preserves on the side that provided jolts of freshness in between bites. Tasty and hearty dish with the perfect refreshing accompaniment.\n\n7) *Desserts and petit four* *(Pic #17 - #20)*‚Äì the desserts started with an exhibition of different berries (elder, sloe and mulberry soup) of varying textures and temperatures. Leaning heavily into the power of fruit, a hearty yet refreshing dessert. I personally found the mulberry soup to be a tad too sweet for my liking, but I do think it served as a perfect precursor to the dessert that followed.\n\nMussel ice cream (what?!) with plums and conifers. A much more delicate dessert than the first palate cleanser, almost savory because of the mussels but balanced by the plums and slightly herbaceous. When digging into this at first, the ice cream texture felt more frozen, almost solid, relative to typical creaminess of ice creams one would expect. It instantaneously melts into a rich creaminess when you take a bite, which I‚Äôm guessing was intentional. Thoroughly enjoyable and again, prepared with a lot of restraint, which seems to be a consistent theme here.\n\nThe petit four is a walnut pie served with a whipped cr√®me fraiche. Quite simply, it is the best piece of pie I‚Äôve ever had.\n\n  \n**Pairings:**\n\nI went with the non-alcoholic pairing, and it was phenomenal. Every drink seemed to be prepared with as much respect as the food using ingredients combined in incredibly creative ways. I‚Äôm a huge fan of NA pairings in general because of the added challenge to concoct drinks from scratch as opposed to pairing with wines that are already the finished produce. I can comfortably say that this is the most creative collection of NA drinks I have come across and all delicately balanced to perfectly complement the food. Highly recommend!\n\n  \n**Service:**\n\nIncredibly friendly service here. The chef walked around at periodic intervals making conversation with all the tables that did not feel intrusive but relaxed. The somms were engaging, patient to answer questions about the food and drink, offering insight into their philosophy and overall, just really nice and likeable people. At the end, I hung around to chat with one of the somms who was very generous with her time, providing recommendations about the city, chatting about her background and providing an insight into the Bornholm location. She also gave me a handwritten list of recommendations around the city to try. While I did not have the time to try them out, I now have a ready-made and vetted list for my next trip. I also appreciate the effortless flow the restaurant moved with ‚Äì the pacing felt just right, communication among the service staff is seemingly smooth, and everyone moving around elegantly with intention and without panic. Like Jordn√¶r the previous night, I felt relaxed, well taken care of and importantly, as a solo diner, like I wasn‚Äôt dining alone because the staff was so engaging. The roughly 4 hours I spent here flew by joyfully.\n\nThe somms here also convinced me to make the trip to Bornholm next time. They spoke of a much more informal atmosphere where folks can walk up to the kitchen, share a drink with the crew, laze around by the water in between courses. They described Bornholm as the more care-free, fun loving older sibling to Copenhagen‚Äôs more responsible and intentional younger one. They spoke of the place with a certain romanticism and joy that felt genuine. Those of you considering the trip, please report back on what you think!\n\n**Summary:**\n\nTo me, this was a 3\\* experience. The restaurant‚Äôs message is cohesive, the food and beverage excellently executed, and their hospitality is incredibly friendly yet professional. I have a soft spot for Kadeau the same way I have one for Valhalla in Chicago ‚Äì they might not be the first names in the city that spring to mind, but they are so unique and true to their philosophy, and excellently executed that they are personal favorites. However, I do not expect that everyone might like Kadeau. People expecting to see rich sauces and decadent cuts of meat might leave disappointed. The Preservation Season specifically leans into their strength in fermentation ‚Äì a lot of preserves and pickles heavily featured ‚Äì which may not be up to everyone‚Äôs speed. If I had to think of a US equivalent to Kadeau, Smyth in Chicago might be a decent comparison in that Smyth feels more experimental in nature relative to its peers ‚Äì heavily uses fermentation techniques, people either love it or feel indifferent about it and even within the menu, Smyth can have hits and misses. I do think Kadeau is more consistent in their execution and overall, significantly more enjoyable with no misses (IMO) on their menu. Those looking for something different from the general richness or extravagance of Western fine dining, this is absolutely a must-try!",

    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

The piercing itself is still kinda sore & itchy sometimes, and also still bleeds sometimes. As for aftercare I‚Äôve just been using saline, and lavender oil as told by my piercer(s) to help with the bump (they told me this about a month ago, it has helped shrink the bump a little bit, I specifically use the dr teals oil). In general it keeps growing & shrinking every so offen, and sometimes when I take out the jewelry it will leak clear fluid & blood.\n\nOverall I‚Äôm at the point where I just want to take it out, but my gut tells me there‚Äôs other things I can do & that taking it out won‚Äôt help me in the long run üò≠üôè Any advice on what else I could do ?",

Some will, but mine i fought with for probably 6 months at least and then it finally went away. If I were in your shoes I would first make sure I have either internally threaded or Threadless flat back jewelry in it, directly from a piercer (preferably an APP piercer), I would stop putting lavender or anything else except saline spray with 0.9% sodium, basically just the premade Neilmed or similar, don't remove the jewelry and only clean in the shower by letting the water run over it not using a q tip or anything that could get stuck on it, and as soon as you see you have some length in your bar on the piercing go back for them to put a shorter post in. This may mean going back 3-4 times, and that's OK! If you think it's enough space go to the shop or text them a photo so they can tell you if you can shorten it!

Two drops of an essential oil (which are being massively diluted) are not going peel her skin off, or age it overnight. \n\nOf course, there are people who do get irritated by essential oils (my own skin hates tea tree), but only Kendall would know that about her skin right? I guess I am not okay with these blanket statements and 'rules' that people like Hyram are teaching.\n\nSkincare is very subjective. Please don't blindly follow people, or judge those who don't do the same thing as you. \n\nIf that video does get better, let me know. I'll finish watching it.",

I tend to focus only on the educational bits and giving props were due - he and others played a huge role in getting me interested in skin care education. The way i see it - if the stink he creates about fragrance etc causes some brands to atleast make a nonfragranced alternative - thats a win for the whole community. Personally Im also okay with him not being a dermatologist because i know he puts a decent amount of research into his work which frankly is a good reference point for me. Im old enough to not be a blind follower of anything and I still also refer  to dr. Sam bunting, dr dray, dr alexis but also really enjoy hyram / james welsh for the entertainment.",

I want you to notice that you are lacking a shit load of self-love right now and we need to balance it out a bit. I know it won't get rid of all of the pain completely but lets give it a damn good go. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Make your bed everyday and make sure you have fresh bedsheets at least once a month \n2. Warm beverages on the regular - cups of tea, coffee, hot chocolate \n3. Good fitting comfortable clothes \n4. Groom yourself: Brush your hair, teeth, wash your face, keep your beard good (fellas), cut your nails, wear clean clothes \n5. Journal your emotions out \n6. Eat at least one good meal a day with equal amounts of protein, good fat and carbohydrates \n7. Listen or watch something uplifting regularly: Eckhart Tolle is good, Stand up comedy, nature documentaries \n8. Self-massage (No, not what your thinking ;), just your body) \n9. Try and get in bed at the same time everyday and minimise the amount of blue light. Buying lavender oil is really good for relaxation \n10. Care for yourself like you are someone WORTH caring for \n\nTake it easy guys",

The last two (Mary Kay and Arbonne) didn't affect too much but our wallets, but DoTerra?? She has denied me actual medicine and anti-depressants and shoved in essential oils in their place. I'm 18 now so I don't need her permission to get actual medications thank goodness. Whenever I was sick I remember this horrible ritual where I would be forced to drink water with Oregano oil in it. It was so bad I didn't drink it but wouldn't be given anything else, and when you're sick fluids are important. I recently learned YOU'RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO CONSUME THEM INTERNALLY!! I tried telling her that for fear of my younger siblings but then she went on this rant about the food we eat needing frequency?? And how she doesn't eat meat anymore because it doesn't have any frequency?? And how essential oils are fine because THEY HAVE FREQUENCY??? I think I've lost her entirely. I'm so glad I found this subreddit because I had to tell somebody. I can't turn to my family because they agree with her. At least now I'm in a place where I can actually get painkillers when I need them. Imagine feeling like you're getting eviscerated due to period pains and your mom is like \"Here sweetie have some lavender oil,\" Or your depression is getting really bad and your mom's only response is giving you a calming \"blend\". No mom I need therapy and drugs the chemicals in my brain are fucked up, giving me an oil that gives me a headache from how strong it smells is literally going to solve nothing\n\n*Edit* It's worsened. I've been having intense pain that I or my doctor can't seem to find a cause of and my mom offered to take me to a doctor. \"Are they a doctor?\" I texted. \"Practitioner/doctor\" she responded. She sent me a link to her website (already a red flag to me) and low and behold, it's all the bs I expected and more. She is in fact *not* a doctor but a 'holistic healer' which offers services like teaching yoga for your specific dosha(?). I guess nobody is taking me or my pain seriously not even my mom",

He was 6 months seizure free when she decided to drop the meds (cold turkey) in favor of diffusing some oil blend. The poor kid went into a massive seizure and although our amazing EMTs got him here fast, the kid was braindead by the end of the night.

The infundibulum within the **hair** follicle (400-600 Œºm deep \\[.4 mm to .6 mm\\]) is lined with a particularly dense network of dendridic cells making it the most immunologically active region, therefore this was specifically targeted for delivery. As they had previously demonstrated that particles of different sizes penetrate **follicles** to different depths, the vaccine carriers were of **1 mm** diameter to target the infundibulum. They showed that their **1 mm** silicon dioxide microparticles efficiently penetrated the **hair** **follicles** to deliver vaccine constituents to dendridic cells in the infundibulum within 1 hour of topical application. They also showed that particles remained as a depot within the **follicle** for up to 10 days contrasting with particles on the stratum corneum \\[most outward layer of skin\\] that were rapidly removed after about 1 day. Follicular delivery of vaccine carried on microparticles provides another potential approach to target the body‚Äôs largest immune organ.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6637104/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6637104/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used a .5 mm **dermaroller** for over a year.

A significant increase in level of **collagen** type I, III, and VII, newly synthesized **collagen** and tropoelastin from baseline was observed after 6 **microneedling** sessions at 2-week intervals. This percutaneous **collagen** induction leads to an overall youthful appearance of the skin by reducing fine lines and wrinkles, reducing pore size, more suppleness, and elasticity.\n\nThe needles also breakdown the old hardened scar strands and allow it to revascularize. Neovascularization and neo**collagen**esis is initiated by migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and laying down of intercellular matrix. A fibronectin matrix forms after 5 days of injury that determines the deposition of **collagen** resulting in skin tightening persisting for 5‚Äì7 years in the form of **collagen** III. The depth of neo**collagen**esis has been found to be 5‚Äì600 ¬µm \\[.5‚Äì.6 mm\\] with a **1.5 mm** length needle. Histological examination of the skin treated with 4 **microneedling** sessions 1 month apart shows upto 400% increase in **collagen** and elastin deposition at 6 months postoperatively, with a thickened stratum spinosum and normal rete ridges at 1 year postoperatively. **Collagen** fibre bundles appear to have a normal lattice pattern rather than parallel bundles as in scar tissue.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976400/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976400/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Low-Level Laser Therapy [LLLT]\n\n2013: **LLLT** was discovered serendipitously in the 1960s when mice irradiated with a low fluence red laser grew **hair**. Animal and human data have slowly accumulated supporting **LLLT** for **hair** growth. **LLLT** appears to improve a variety of non-scarring alopecias‚ÄîAGA \\[Androgenetic Alopecia\\], AA \\[Alopecia Areata\\], and chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Based on the studies demonstrating **LLLT**'s effects on promoting graft survival, it may be further suggested to have a potential to be used during the immediate period of post-**hair** transplant surgery to facilitate the healing process and enhance viability and earlier growth of the grafts. While mechanisms are still emerging, **LLLT** may increase **anagen hairs** through release of NO \\[Nitric Oxide\\] from CCO \\[cytochrome c oxidase\\] by photodissociation and **LLLT** may reduce inflammation in AA. Most studies investigating effects of **LLLT** on **hair** growth have used wavelengths that range from **635 nm** to **650 nm**, but as of today no study has compared the effect of near-infrared wavelengths such as **810 nm**, which have deeper penetrating capacities, to red light.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2013: **LLLT** aids skin rejuvenation through increasing **collagen** production and decreasing **collagen** degradation. LED which is a novel light source for non-thermal, non-ablative skin rejuvenation has been shown to be effective for improving wrinkles and skin laxity. It is not a new phenomenon since the first reports of **LLLT** effects on increased **collagen** go back to 1987. Studies by Abergel et al. and Yu et al. reported an increase in production of pro-**collagen**, **collagen**, basic fibroblast **growth factors** (bFGF) and proliferation of fibroblasts after exposure to low-energy laser irradiation in vitro and in vivo animal models. Furthermore, **LLLT** was already known to increase microcirculation, vascular perfusion in the skin, alter platelet-derived **growth factor** (PDGF), transforming **growth factor** (TGF-Œ≤1) and inhibit apoptosis.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126803/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126803/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LLLT Use**\n\nMy LLLT wand/stick is to be used once every two days.

Treatment of such photodamaged skin with all-trans **retinoic acid** increases type I pro**collagen** expression. The mechanism of this increase is not known, however, it may involve increased expression or activation of TGF-Œ≤. In addition, treatment of skin with all-trans **retinoic acid** before UV exposure inhibits **collagen** breakdown by matrix metalloproteinases and protects against UV-induced reduction of pro**collagen** expression, as demonstrated in this study. Therefore, all-trans **retinoic acid** and its metabolic precursor all-trans **retinol** (**vitamin A**) should have the capacity to both repair existing photodamage and retard accumulation of new photodamage.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381286/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381286/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tretinoin Prescription**\n\nTo get **tretinoin** you need to have a doctor‚Äôs prescription‚Äìin USA. A way to do this is to say that it is for Actinic Keratosis.\n\n2011: Actinic keratosis is the third most common skin complaint treated by dermatologists in the US and, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, 60% of predisposed individuals over the age of 40 years have at least one lesion. They occur most frequently on sun-exposed skin of the face, scalp, arms, and hands. Important risk factors include fair skin, cumulative sun exposure, and immunosuppression, including further ultraviolet light exposure. Actinic keratosis is now considered to be the beginning of a biologic continuum that leads to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, thus treatment is medically necessary.\n\nSource:[ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132090/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132090/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActinic keratoses describes lesions caused by too much exposure to the ultraviolet rays of sunlight. They are the beginnings of skin cancer, most often appearing after age 40. In some areas where climate is mild year-round, these lesions appear in much younger people. People with fair skin, blond or red hair, and blue or green eyes are most at risk of developing these rough, scaly patches, or keratoses.\n\nSource: [https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-actinic-keratosis-basics](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-actinic-keratosis-basics)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tretinoin Use**\n\nI am supposed to use my **tretinoin** every evening‚Äìso I assume all are to be used daily‚Äìbut the study used **.01%**, I was given **.1%**. The skin cell cycle is 28 days, if I don't use my **tretinoin** for even half that, 2 days after the first application I am peeling all over; it looks terrible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Retinoids**\n\nTopical **retinoids** are still considered the gold standard for clinically effective topical antiaging products . **Retinoids** are a family of compounds composed of **vitamin A**, its derivatives, and synthetic molecules acting through the same pathway. Besides all-trans **retinoic acid** (**RA**), the major bioactive form, the term ‚Äú**retinoids**‚Äù includes retinaldehyde, retinol, and various retinyl esters. They act through **retinoic acid** receptors (RARs) and **retinoid** X receptors (RXRs), increasing the amount of type I procollagens and decreasing the amount of MMPs. **RA** increases the amount of type I, III, and VII **collagens** in the **dermis**, and can reorganize the dermal **collagen** into new woven bundles. In addition, **RA** stimulates normalization of the elastic tissue organization and GAG deposition in the **dermis**. In clinical trials, topical **retinoids** are clinically effective for the treatment of dermal aging, including wrinkles, roughness, and laxity. However, they can be irritating to a significant percentage of the population, and further development of ways to reduce their irritation potential is needed. Retinol, which metabolizes to retinaldehyde and **retinoic acid**, has been found to be less irritating than **retinoic acid** and is widely used as an ingredient for antiaging cosmeceuticals.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540032/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540032/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Vitamin C\n\nNote: **Vitamin C**‚Äôs purest form is  **L-ascorbic acid**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017: The following information is available as a result of research into the role of **vitamin C** in skin health:\n\n* Skin fibroblasts have an absolute dependence on **vitamin C** for the synthesis of **collagen**, and for the regulation of the **collagen**/elastin balance in the dermis. There is ample in vitro data with cultured cells demonstrating this dependency. In addition, **vitamin C** supplementation of animals has shown improved **collagen** synthesis in vivo.\n* Skin keratinocytes have the capacity to accumulate high concentrations of **vitamin C**, and this in association with vitamin E affords protection against UV irradiation. This information is available from in vitro studies with cultured cells, with supportive information from animal and human studies.\n* Analysis of keratinocytes in culture has shown that **vitamin C** influences gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, the organisation and accumulation of phospholipids, and promotes the formation of the stratum corneum \\[most outward layer of skin\\] and the differentiation of the epithelium in general.\n* Signs of aging in human skin can be ameliorated through the provision of **vitamin C**. A number of studies support this, although measurement of skin changes is difficult. Some studies include objective measures of **collagen** deposition and wrinkle depth.\n* The provision of **vitamin C** to the skin greatly assists wound healing and minimises raised scar formation. This has been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies in humans and animals.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2012: **L-ascorbic acid** can be used orally and topically for skin benefits. **Vitamin C** is a cofactor for lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase, which stabilize the triple helical structure of **collagen**. It also plays a role in cholesterol synthesis, iron absorption and increases the bioavailability of selenium. The most commonly described cutaneous manifestations accompanying **vitamin C** deficiency are attributed to the impaired **collagen** synthesis.\n\nFurthermore, oral administration of an antioxidant mixture containing **vitamin C**, vitamin E, pycnogenol and evening primrose oil significantly inhibited wrinkle formation caused by chronic UVB irradiation through significant inhibition of UVB-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity accompanied by enhancement of **collagen** synthesis on hairless mouse skin.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vitamin C Use**\n\n2001: L-ascorbic acid must be formulated at pH levels less than 3.5 to enter the skin. Maximal concentration for optimal percutaneous absorption was 20%. Tissue levels were saturated after three daily applications; the half-life of tissue disappearance was about 4 days. Derivatives of ascorbic acid including magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl-6-palmitate, and dehydroascorbic acid did not increase skin levels of L-ascorbic acid.\n\nSource: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207686/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207686/)\n\nThe above says that **vitamin C**‚Äôs low pH may irritate your skin. So only use it a few days before a **dermarolling** session, it only takes 3 daily applications of 20% **vitamin C** to saturate the skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hyaluronic Acid [HA]\n\nNotes: **HA** can be bought as a lotion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFindings \\[from 1999\\] indicated that suppression of transcriptional activity of type VI **collagen** is associated with the reduction of cartilage matrix tissue, and that **HA** is associated with the suppression of the effect of IL-1Œ≤.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat sentence is hard to understand. It says that **HA** suppresses the effect of IL-1Œ≤, which is good because IL-1Œ≤ suppresses transcriptional activity of type VI **collagen**, which in effect reduces the cartilage matrix tissue.\n\n2011: A major component of the extracellular matrix is \\[**HA**\\] or **hyaluronan**. **HA** is a naturally occurring anionic **polysaccharide** most abundantly present in mammalian skin where it is localized not only in the **dermis** (‚âà0.5mg/g wet tissue), but also in the **epidermis** (‚âà0.1mg/g wet tissue). Due to its considerable capacity to bind water, **HA has greater skin hydration properties than other** **polysaccharides**. Topical application of **HA** increases hydration of the \\[stratum corneum‚Å†‚Äîmost outward layer of skin\\] largely through a humectant effect.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050617/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050617/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2018: \\[**HA**\\] is a naturally occurring biopolymer in bacteria and vertebras. **HA** is a highly hydrophilic molecule with the ability to bind water up to a 1000 times its own weight.\n\nThe turnover rate of **HA** in vivo depends on where the **HA** is located. The half time of **HA** in the circulation system is approximaty 2-5 minutes while the half time in more rigid tissue, such as cartilage, is 1-3 weeks.

My two young girls have been smiling so much that they might have crows feet when we get home and the wife and I have felt warmth in our hearts from watching the kids have so much fun! It was amazing fun for us too!\n\nThe only negative is the smells immediately outside the park. You cannot walk down a sidewalk for more than 20 feet without smelling raw sewage. It is around the entire park perimeter. We walked down Disneyland dr and Katella Ave every day and had to bring lavender oil to smell for most of the walk. You are literally walking into raw sewage smell the entire way from Westin to Downtown Disney. The walk itself isn‚Äôt bad and is in fact quite beautiful. But for the rest of my life, whenever I smell raw sewage, it will remind me of our first trip to Disneyland. It is a terrible problem. \n\nIs this a year round problem? Is this a temporary issue that the city/park is having? Has this always been the case?",

    "body": "Did you know that a panic attack should only last around 3 minutes? \n\n\"No way! When I get a panic attack it's for hours and the only thing that helps me is squeezing ice cubes/sniffing lavender oil/5-4-3-2-1/calming music/[insert literally any other \"cure]!\"\n\nYes. Because you're FIGHTING a bear when there's no bear to fight. \n\nThis is my \"cure\" to panic attacks (I didn't come up with this! All my knowledge comes from podcasts Disordered, The Anxious Truth, The Panic Pod and DARE because I'm too lazy to read books lol). I had a *seemingly* 3h long panic attack on New Years. Now I can have a 5 minute panic attack at the gym and keep going with my workout and have a normal rest of the day.\n\nFirst of all, a \"panic attack\" is just your body dumping a bunch of adrenaline, because your nervous system has become sensitized and has perceived something innocuous as a threat. I say this not to minimize how f*king AWFUL it feels, but to help you realize that you're not in danger. Your SNS activates. Your stomach is in knots, you feel hyper alert, heart beating, maybe trembling, feeling the need to get up and get out, etc. Right? \n\nIf there was a real threat, like a bear, you would not notice any of these things. You would just act! You would use that energy to run, heart pounding and pushing blood to your legs so you can move fast, rational thoughts out the window. That's how I know you're not in danger. You're not doing any of that. But are you?\n\nThis is where the trouble starts. It has become very widespread to use STRESS reduction to control your AUTONOMIC nervous system. It's in the name, you can't control it! So all of a sudden, your body activates the SNS even though there's no bear, and you grab all of your cures, your \"weapons\" to \"fight\" the \"panic attack\". And how does that work out for you? Does your anxiety calm down immediately? Or does it slowly let go as you stop thinking about it (which it does without the help of those \"cures\" all the time...)?\n\nWhat happens when you have a panic attack outside, without all of your supplies? Or do you limit your life based on your anxiety? \n\nPlease. As someone who's finally feeling hope about fixing my relationship with anxiety. Try having a panic attack without \"fixing\" it. \n\nWhen you start feeling it come on, face it head on. Objectively name your bodily sensations (not \"*feels like* I'm gonna throw up\". Instead \"my throat feels tight, I feel a bit nauseous\"), take a *few* mindful breaths so you're not just hyperventilating and making yourself feel dizzier than needed, relax your shoulders and hands and just delay your compulsive behavior. Tell yourself you can have the gum in 10 seconds. Maybe then push it back a little bit more. \n\nThe crest of anxiety will come quicker, but it will also subside quicker. When you stop being afraid of panic attacks, it really does feel like a wave of cold water washing over you. It's really unpleasant, but it will pass! It's biologically impossible to be stuck in a panic attack.\n\nThis is really wordy, I'm sorry, some day I'll make a much more detailed post about my whole anxiety journey. While I'm still in the thick of it, I just wanted to post this thing, because I see so many comments that are leading people down the same path I went down. I'm getting better! I'm still anxious almost every day, but it's becoming less and less obstructive, less enemy more annoying companion. \n",

Ive always been a bit sensitive to it, would feel a bit of tingling, and then I would be fine.\n\nBut lately it is making my lips raw and painful, and even a bit puffy. The problem is that my favorite brand uses lavender oil to scent all of their products! I have 12 of their lipsticks, 12. And all of them are now super irritating to me, I cant use them anymore I am so sad. I used to use them as lipsticks, eyeshadow, and blush. And now I cant put them anywhere near my face, it honestly making me really mad.\n\nBut also, its a lesson. I dont need 12 of anything. Especially not super expensive indie brand witchy lipsticks. No matter how nice the colors or the packaging is. Also its good to have a bit of variety. Yes I love those lipsticks now, but for whatever reason I might not like them in the future. So really one or two is enough. Not 12.\n\nI am on a no buy, so I wont be replacing anything. I will stop using them a few months and see if I still react to them. For now my tinted balms and other lipsticks will have to do. If in January when my no buy is over I still cant stand lavender oil, I will choose one or two  colors I can purchase in another formula. But no more buying the whole collection for me. Its just dumb and unnecessary, and maybe detrimental to your health.\n\nEdit: Since people are asking, its Rituel de Fille lipsticks. I still love them, and highly recommend them if you aren't sensitive to lavender or strong fragrance. Im dropping all makeup for a few weeks until I feel better, and will slowly introduce other items back in. For now my lips cant even take chapstick so I will be using vaseline a while.",

Some essential oils are not safe for skin contact, but they still end up on an ingredient list for topical products. \n\nYou can use \"skin-safe\" essential oils, but they have to be heavily diluted.

    "body": "After a couple of infuriating hours trying to collect all the items from these dungeons, I thought I'd post some tips to lessen the grind I wish I had known before.  \n\nTL;DR: Plan for two trips through all \"Cave\" type key dungeons. Write down the correct door on intersection floors. On your subsequent run, take the correct doors last, allowing you to search each dead end for loot.  OR, for an even easier way follow the sage advice of /u/Piflik:  \n\n>During the first trip, go through the exits of a room counter-clockwise. During the second go clockwise (or vice versa). No need to keep track of the correct exit.\n\nAnother tip per /u/lewdasarus that potentially lets you always know which path is a dead end:  \n\n> If you CANNOT target the enemies in the room with a ranged weapon even if they are right next to the door, it is the room that will lock. If you CAN target them then it is an optional room that will not lock completely, you will aggro them from inside the hall and actually kill them in the hall using ranged attacks. The door will open again after they die.  \n\n**Tips:**  \n\n- First off, there are 2 types of Key Dungeons: Caves and Ruins.  \n- In each type of Key Dungeon there will be a couple of \"Intersection\" rooms, that have 4 doors in them.  \n- One of those doors is where you entered from, 2 of those doors lead to dead ends that sometimes contain very strong accessories, and the last door will let you continue on with the dungeon.  \n- In the \"Ruins\" type dungeons (Costlemark and Steyliff), the intersection rooms are easy to figure out. The two dead end doors lead to very short hallways with items at the end of them. So make sure you've explored both dead ends before proceeding downward.  \n- Also in the \"Ruins\" type dungeons, aside from the camps and intersection rooms, strong accessories can ALSO be found in normal, small rooms. So it's best not to skip any rooms by teleporting through the gate.\n- In the \"Cave\" type dungeons (All the other ones), it is a bit harder. There is no way to tell which door is a dead end the first time through, and if you choose the correct door that leads deeper into the dungeon, the door will lock behind you, preventing you from visiting the dead ends and collecting your loot.  \n- As such I would advise you plan to make at least 2 runs through the cave dungeons if you want to get everything.  \n- On your first run, make note of every intersection room, and which paths you've taken. The cave intersection rooms are always the same: A door to the bottom left (that you entered from), then doors at the far end left wall, at the right end of the back wall, and at the right end of the wall you came from. I just go clockwise around the room from where I entered and number the doors 1, 2, and 3. By keeping track of which numbered door is the \"correct\" one, on your second run through you can make sure to travel the paths you missed and pick up those accessories.  \n- So for example, the \"correct\" path through Glacial Grotto is Door 3 at the first intersection, Door 2 at the second intersection, and door 1 at the third intersection. Exploring all other doors before entering these will allow you to get everything.  \n\n**General Dungeon Tips:**  \n\n- A combo of Promto's Piercer, followed by Ignis' Overwhelm is OP as hell when it comes to single target DPS. If you eat a meal with the Technician perk, your Tech bar will fill up insanely fast, especially if paired with a good dagger. This will allow you to do around half an enemies health bar in damage, with you team invulnerable the entire time. Great for taxing fights like Master Tonberry, Elder Couerls, and the Quad Giant room in Costlemark. A side note: Ignis Overwhelm is unaffected by limit break for some reason, so don't feel pressured into buying it.  \n\n- For large groups of small enemies, instead consider Gladios' Impulse skill. This one definitely benefits from limit break, hitting all enemies on screen for 30K twice with the right setup.  \n\n- Unlike previous Final Fantasy games (and contrary to its tooltip), Ribbon now protects from instant death. It would be wise to have at least 3, for Noctis, Gladios, and Ignis, to help fight Coeurls, since their AoE lightning attack (Blaster) can inflict instant death. Safety Bit also works if you don't have enough Ribbons. Promto never seems to have trouble with instant death, he stays far back in most of my fights.  \n\n- While you cannot save mid-dungeon, Camping creates an auto-save. If you are re-visiting a dungeon just for the loot you missed, you can re-load from this auto save after choosing a wrong (correct) path, and take the other paths to get your loot without having to re-enter the dungeon.  \n\n- You also cannot simply walk out of key dungeons, as many doors lock behind you. If you need to give up, or simple want to leave after completing the dungeon, press \"Map\", then \"Return to entrance\".  \n\n- For the no-items (Costlemark) dungeon, you can effectively heal via the following: Field Medicine (Noctis heals himself when at half health - Daurell Cave Key Dungeon), Good/Grand Chamberlain (Ignis heals Noctis when at half health - Steyliff Grove/Fociaugh), First Aid Kit (Teammates heal themselves - Ascension Grid Ability), Crafting the strongest Healcast Level 99 spells you can - Each cast can heal Noctis for about 6,500+ Max HP, acting like an Elixer.  \n\n- Master Tonberries: Simply hold block the entire time, parry/counter with greatswords, and combo Piercer->Overwhelm for huge DPS.  \n- Invincible Flans: Use Propmto's Gravisphere, two casts should wipe the entire room without forcing you to deal with magic switching.  \n\n- Costlemark Bosses - Jormungand & Bilrost: Both of these bosses deal most of their damage through fire. Using the Flame-Proof suit (Lestallum, on a bench outside the EXOGEN reactor) you'll mitigate most of the damage in this fight.  \n\n**Some of the Loot to look out for:**  \n\n- Keycatrich - Dominator Great Sword, Hyper Magnum Handgun, Wizard Shield, Diamond Bracelet, Rune Earring, Circlet.  \n\n- Fociaugh - Thieves Way (Normal Dungeon), Enhancer Sword, Organyx Dagger, The Grand Chamberlain, Earth Pendant, Moon Pendant, Centurion Bangle, Diamond Bracelet, Lavender Oil.  \n \n- Greyshire Glacial Grotto - Vigilantes Daggers, Executioner Handgun, Black Belt, Safety Bit, Rainbow Pendant, Star Pendant.  \n\n- Daurel Caverns - Duel Code Greatsword, Precision Lance, Field Medicine, Moogle Charm, Golden Hourglass.  \n\n- Balouve Mines - Apocalype Greatsword, Death Penalty Handgun, Emperors Anklet, Oracle Earring.  \n\n- Steyliff Grove (100 Floor Ruin) - Balmung Sword, Flayer Lance, Aegis Shield, Robe of the Lord, Celestriad, Anklet of the Gods.  \n\n- Crestholm Channels - Target Scope, Auto-Changer (both in the normal dungeon), Gigas Bangle, Blue Diamond Bracelet, Mighty Guard, Tarot Card, Anklet of the Gods.  \n\n- Costlemark Tower (No Item Ruin) - Thieves Way II, The Good Chamberlain (Normal Dungeon) Soul of Thamasa, Dark Matter Bracelet, Applied Sorcery, Celestriad, Tarot Card, Hypno Crown, Black Choker, Onion Bangle. Gigas Bangle.\n",

And volunteering. \n\nAnd a million other things and emotions.\n\nAnd you know what?

The holden key is to represent hecate opening doors for me in my life. 2 pommagranets. 1 clove of garlic, 4 honey oat hazelnut biscuits, 1 raw egg. I placed a sage incense. The crystals are Labradorite, black Tourmaline, black moonstone and obsidian. All those offerings are on a silver circular tray to represent the moon. To the left is a mirror skeleton to represent the dead that follows her. And my piece of petition paper asking for what I'd like to gain in tonight's prayer. All this I placed the items on a black table cloth. Tonight's offering, meditation and prayer is dedicated to Hecate, to the dead and to my ancestors. ",

Religious in any way or not, what you do in private is for you or between you and you god(s); no one else has any right to question that, so I now tell them that they are welcome to pray for me in private, as their religion suggests, and that I will do what I feel is best in private as well. This is all under the pretense that they are advocating for prayer without admonishing proper treatment; admonishing treatment is always unacceptable.\n\nRelated to that, and for the alternative medicine folks, I still get pretty nasty with them, because they deserve to know that their beliefs are damaging and potentially fatal to impress upon those who are in a genuinely horrifying and difficult place, who may be more susceptible to such suggestions. It may seem harsh, but I'll question them directly on whether their \"expertise\" means that they feel comfortable with my blood on their hands when their methods fail. This is especially true when they push substances that have the possibility to make certain cancers worse, like marijuana, which some seem to love to tout as a miracle in order to justify their self-medicated dependence on (worth noting that I was 17 when first diagnosed, so I'd hear this rampantly from teens who truly believed that no one could tell how often they were stoned, and that they used marijuana as a crutch consistently).\n\nI've found that, generally, all these people mean well, but are self-righteous about their lifestyles and beliefs, and truly resent the idea that they could be (and in my understanding are) wrong. I treat those who are harmless like children who believe in Santa, and outwardly criticize those who push a narrative to justify their lifestyle without evidence.\n\nNothing too quippy, but hopefully another perspective helps you to figure out how you want to handle such situations.",

It's that time again when I feel like it's necessary to make a guide, but this time round, this guide is specifically aimed towards the newer players who are coming up to **post-game** as well as players who are already in **post-game** yet has no idea how to build their characters, as I've seen from numerous threads asking about builds etc. Characters builds are definitely situational in most cases, you get your typical builds that are used a lot, and builds which you'll rarely use yet useful when it truly comes down to it. On that note, let's get down to it!\n\n- *(Note: I take no credit to any of the videos that may be used in this comprehensive guide!)*\n- *(Note #2: I decided to add other information to this guide also, so builds will be at the bottom of the guide for those who don't need the extra information and only want to look at builds.)*\n- *(Note #3: All of the content in this thread is strictly for post-game. None of these will be included prior to POST-GAME.)*\n\n#12 Open World Collectibles!\n\nThere are **12 items** that spawns only during post-game, these will not be available prior to post-game. \n\n- Wizard Shield - +225 Attack, +34 Vitality, +99 Magic, +12% Bullet Resistance\n- Hyper Magnum *(Pistol)* - +388 Attack, +21 Spirit\n- Chobham Armor *(Accessory)* - +30% Bullet Resistance\n- Circlet *(Accessory)* - +150 Magic\n- Dragoon Lance *(Polearm)* - 246 Attack, +15% Fire Resistance, +14% Ice Resistance, +16% Lightning Resistance\n- Champion's Anklet *(Accessory)* - +100 Vitality\n- Diamond Bracelet *(Accessory)* - +70 Strength\n- Black Choker *(Accessory)* - Increase HP Recovery rate phenomenally. \n- Dominator *(2-Hand)* - 583 Attack, +298 HP.\n- Silver Bangle *(Accessory)* - +300 HP.\n- Iron Duke *(2-Hand)* - 581 Attack, +153 HP.\n- Organyx *(Daggers)* - 248 Attack, +10 MP, +25 Vitality, +23 Magic, +32 Spirit, +10% Fire/Ice/Lightning/Dark Resistance.\n\n*(Note: All these items can respawn upon pick-up, all you have to do is go to the closest Tipster of each respective item. Sleep in the caravan, head to the Tipster and select TALK upon prompt.

He will give you a chain of 5 quests, each requiring to kill a quest **boss**. They're all pretty simple, but you may struggle with the last boss. I'll get to that here in a moment.\n\n- Boss #1 - **Lv55 Bennu** - Iron Duke *(2-Hand)* - 581 Attack, +153 HP\n- Boss #2 - **Lv65 Malbodoom** - Dragoon Lance *(Polearm)* - 246 Attack, +15% Fire Resistance, +14% Ice Resistance, +16% Lightning Resistance\n- Boss #3 - **2x Lv75 Sir Tonberry** - Ziedrich Shield - 327 Attack, +50 Vitality, +14% Bullet Resistance\n- Boss #4 - **Lv85 Phalaris** - Soul Saber *(Sword)* - 343 Attack, +12 MP\n- Boss #5 - **Lv120 Nagalfar** - Zwill Crossblades *(Daggers)* - 345 Attack, +5 MP, +25 Magic\n\n- *(Note: This only important part to this chain quest is getting hold of the Zwill Crossblades. Why? Despite the lack of attributes it has to offer, Zwill Crossblades is by far the best DPS weapon by far in the vanilla status as of yet. How? The damage output is multiplied by a large percentage if you have full HP. In other words, you'll be doing a whole lot more damage with the more HP you have. Sitting at 9999 HP during a fight and not losing HP yet also hitting the target, you'll be dishing out high dps at all time.)*\n\n- -> [Randolph's Location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWmPny-k3zM) <-\n\n#Quest: Menace Beneath Lucis - Ezma in Meldacio Hunter HQ\n\nYou will need to complete all of the quest in the following dungeons to be able to get the **Key** to ever sealed doors within each respective dungeon from **Ezma**.\n\n- Costlemark Tower\n- Balouve Mines\n- Crestholm Channels\n- Daurell Caverns\n\n- *Protip: Watch the following video and follow it before you clear the Daurell Caverns dungeon to complete the quest.

Also, I highly recommend getting this.

It takes a lot of time farming, however, but it is all worth it if RNG is by your side, for the V2's, that is. **[HIGHLY RECOMMENDED]** \n- **Cerberus Rifle** *(Prompto can't use this, only for Noctis)* - [Location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7ljzreBqcM) - This is, or at least personally, useless. But hey, I got one due to being a completionist!\n- **Season Pass**: Booster Pack+ DLC - **Ragnarok**. By far the best weapon for warp-striking, 9999's for days. \n\n#Builds!

This build also works against Physical Immune mobs but I'd personally recommend simply sticking to Strength/DPS build and replace Ulric's Kukris with a spell, it's faster to use a spell than Ring of Lucii in situations against Physical Immune mobs.)*\n\n- *Main Weapon*: Ring of Lucii\n- *Equipped for Attributes*: Wizard Shield, Scepter of Pious, Sword of the Father\n- *Accessories*: All **+Magic**, of course, from **highest to lowest**\n- *Situational Accessories Options*: Ribbon\n- *Situational Costumes* - Royal Raiment *(+MP %)* **or** Royal Raiment (No Jacket) *(+Magic %)*\n\n**Ragnarok (Booster Pack+ DLC Weapon) Build** *(Very, very situational)* - *(Note: The only reason I'm putting up a build for this is because if you're fighting a boss, per se, a MA-X Angelus, for example - he has a lot of HP, so you'll be warp-striking a lot, thus needing more MP yet also warp-striking. This is very much the same as your default DPS/Strength build)*\n\n- *Main Weapon*: Ragnarok\n- *Equipped for Attributes*: Sword of the Father, Axe of the Conqueurer, Trident of the Oracle\n- *Accessories*: Magitek Suit V1, Magitek Suit V1, Magitek Suit V1 **-** Magitek Suit V2, Magitek Suit V2, Magitek Suit V2 **-** Magitek Suit V1/V2, Magitek Suit V1/V2, Black Hood **-** Dark Matter Bracelet, Dark Matter Bracelet, Dark Matter Bracelet\n- *Situational Accessories Options*: Ribbon\n- *Situational Costumes* - Royal Raiment *(+MP %)* *(For more Warp-strike Spam)* **or** Princes Fatigues (No Jacket) *(+Strength %)*\n\n#Gladio\n- *2-Hand Weapon*: Dominator or Apocalypse\n- *Shield*: Ziedrich\n- *Accessories*: Magitek Suit V1, Magitek Suit V1, Megaphone **-** Magitek Suit V2, Magitek Suit V2, Megaphone \n- *Situational Accessories Options*: Extra Magitek Suit V1/2 for third slot, Blackbelt, Friendship Band.\n- *Situational Costumes*: Crownsguard Fatigues (No Jacket) *(If you're using Critical Hit Rate Buff)* **-** Casual Outfit (No Jacket) *(If you're using +Strength Food Buff)*\n\n#Ignis\n- *Daggers*: Vigilantes\n- *Polearm*: Flayer\n- *Accessories*: Magitek Suit V1, Magitek Suit V1, Magitek Suit V1 **-** Magitek Suit V2, Magitek Suit V2, Magitek Suit V2 \n- *Situational Accessories Option*: Anklet of the Gods, Adamantite Bangle, Grand Chamberlain.\n- *Situational Costumes*: Kingsglaive Garb **or** Casual Outfit \n\n#Prompto\n- *Pistol*: Death Penalty\n- *Secondary*: Drillbreaker Plus\n- *Accessories*: Magitek Suit V1, Magitek Suit V1, Magitek Suit V1 **-** Magitek Suit V2, Magitek Suit V2, Magitek Suit V2 \n- *Situational Accessories Option*: None, because I highly recommend the **Magitek Suit V2**. \n- *Situational Costumes*: Crownsguard Fatigues (No Jacket) *(Strength DPS)*, Casual Outfit (No Jacket)*(Crit)* **or** Kingsglaive Garb (DEF)\n\nOnce again, I hope this will help the community, specifically the upcoming players who are about to reach post-game! All the builds are based off end-game, after doing everything. If you don't have the items used for the build(s), don't worry - take a look at it and readjust accordingly with your items. Yes, I also built the builds based off having unlocked **3x Accessory** slots.\n\nGood luck to you all!",

If yes then immediately see a general physician. If you're indian and/or is still in Delhi that is. Idk what they call it in other places.\n\nIf it's mainly just the itching then do go to dermatologist. But also take the aftercare your artist suggested.\n\nI'd switch to simple moisturizer tho. Using simple Nivea soft (the white one) works really well on tattoos.\n\nAlso you can lightly slap on the area the itch will soothe a bit. But if too itchy definitely go to Doctor. Even if it's not infected, you might be allergic to colours or the brand of ink they used. There might be lot of factorsm",

    "body": "Here are some of the soft maxxing tips I have been using lately. They are pretty random but I hope they're helpful! :)\n\n- Posture: always make sure to have good posture! This makes you look taller, slimmer, more confident, elegant, etc. Use your abs when sitting and walking and fix your forward head posture. Also, mewing lifts your hyoid while doing it so your jaw looks sooo much better.\n\n- Facial expressions: make sure your eyebrows and eyes are relaxed and your nostrils aren't flared. When you smile try to only lift the corners of your mouth (try not to use the muscles in the philtrum area), use your cheek muscles, and lift your lower eyelids. I've also been training the muscles that lift your ears lol as this lifts the tails of your eyebrows.\n\n- Lavender oil for feet: If you tend to get foot fungus like me (gross, ik lol) apply pure lavender oil in the morning before putting on socks and at night before bed. It's antifungal so it'll help.\n\n- Carrots: eat at least 1 carrot (or sweet potato, etc) per day for that beta carotene! Beta carotene can make your skin tone warmer and helps your skin protect itself from the sun üåû\n\n- Loungewear/pyjamas: make sure you have pretty/elegant loungewear! This is such an underrated stylemax. Toss those old tshirts and get yourself nice satin pyjama sets and a robe! Knitwear is nice for lounging too. Also opt for satin scrunchies rather than hair ties to prevent hair breakage.\n\n- Tubing mascara: I used to never wear mascara because my sunscreen would make it smudge, but tubing mascara isn't oil soluble so it won't smudge at all! It's also super easy to remove (with warm water, be very gentle) so you lose fewer lashes.\n\n- Coconut oil for lashes: coconut oil has been proven to be effective at preventing hair breakage. Personally I like to apply a little bit in the morning and night and after 30mins or so I'll remove the excess with a tissue.\n\n- Sulfate, fragrance, drying alcohol, silicone free shampoo and conditioner: following the curly girl method has made my hair much less frizzy! Use the subreddit's bot to check the ingredients of all your hair products to see if they contain these drying ingredients.\n\n- BHA: using BHA on my body acne and nose blackheads has made such a difference!\n\n- Shower everday: this has made such a difference for me! Even if you don't want to wash your hair every day (although I do), make sure to wash your body! Warm water is enough to dissolve the sweat off your body but make sure to use bodywash in your skinfolds, on your feet, and anywhere you've applied sunscreen that day.\n\nOf course there's a bunch of other obvious ones like using a satin pillowcase, water, sleep, sunscreen, etc but I hope this was helpful for some people üíñ",
