    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down\n\nThat's because silicones are not the devil that cg hair community paints them out to be... Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

I would love to use it morning *and* evening, but I'm concerned that it may be too occlusive to use under my chemical sunscreen (Biore Watery Essence). Thoughts? \n\nThe first two ingredients in the list make up 42% of the product, [according to the Banila Co website.](http://global.banilaco.com/Product/Detail/view/pid/2212/cid/540/spn/Miss-Flower-Mr.Honey-Cream)\n\n**Ingredients**: Honey extract, aureobasidium pullulans ferment, dipropylene glycol, dimethicone, cyclopentasilloxane, butylene glycol, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, PCA dimethicone, niacinamide, glycereth-26, petrolatum, trisiloxane, glyceryl stearate SE, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, chrysanthellum indicum extract, plukenetia volubilis seed oil, argania spinosa kernel oil, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, royal jelly extract, calendula officinalis flower extract, chamomilla recutita seed oil, pentylene glycol, dimethiconol, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, PEG-150 distearate, water, raffinose, caprylyl glycol, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, adenosine, arginine, caprylic/capric triglyceride, octyldodecanol, hydrogenated coco-glycerides, sodium starch octenylsuccinate, maltodextrin, calcium pantothenate, hydrogenated lecithin, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, tocopheryl acetate, pyridoxine HCI, silica, xanthan gum, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, fragrance, CI 19140\n\n**Edit: A random episode of The Beauty Brains podcast that I listened to in bed answered my question! They said occlusivity measures how well an ingredient keeps water from evaporating out of the skin (usually by being hydrophobic) but isn't really correlated with how well it prevents actives from penetrating into the skin as long as what you want to absorb is oil soluble. Alcohol is, and my sunscreen has a bunch of that, so I think I'm good!**",

I started using Apple Cider Vinegar and Fermented Rice Water. I later tried Lemon Juice and Fermented Rice Water, which cleaned better. I recently found out that Rye Flour also works for cleaning hair, but the two stores nearest do me don't have any, although there are two further away stores that I haven't been too yet.

I've been reading and researching about it but got even more confused so I thought I'd ask here lol.\n\nAbout three weeks ago I decided to get one and my hairdresser told me not to use anything containing salt (but said nothing about sulfates, or i might have missed it lol). So, I got the Loreal Eversleek shampoo because its advertised as specifically made and a safe shampoo for keratin treated hair. After I got home I started reading the ingredient list and to my surprise, sodium chloride is listed as an ingredient! So I guess what im asking is if its safe to use? Has anyone tried it? Will it strip off the treatment out of my hair? I dont really get the \\~science\\~ behind it and the differences between using sodium and salts and sulfates.   \nI also have been using a sodium free but not sulfate free shampoo, and I dont really like it so I wanna know if this is safe and worth giving a shot. \n\nHere's the ingredient list: AQUA / WATER / EAU  \nSODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE  \nLAURETH-5 CARBOXYLIC ACID  \n**SODIUM CHLORIDE**  \nCOCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE  \nGLYCERIN  \nPEG-150 DISTEARATE  \nPARFUM / FRAGRANCE  \nCOCONUT ACID  \nSODIUM BENZOATE  \nSODIUM LAUROYL GLUTAMATE  \nPOLYQUATERNIUM-10  \nSALICYLIC ACID  \nHEXYL CINNAMAL  \nLINALOOL  \nBENZYL SALICYLATE  \nBENZYL ALCOHOL  \nHELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED EXTRACT / SUNFLOWER SEED EXTRACT  \nLIMONENE  \nCITRONELLOL  \nSODIUM HYDROXIDE  \nLACTIC ACID FIL CODE D55635/1\n\nAlso I think is worth mentioning Im from a little country located in South America, so my access to hair products is very limited, and the ones that we have are super overpriced compared to the states.\n\nThank you so much in advance !",

        "body": "I've been getting keratin treatments (and color) for years. My stylist has always told me to use sulfate-free products and to avoid anything (including styling products)  that has sodium chloride in the ingredient list. IIRC it has something to do with sodium chloride effectively stripping the keratin out of your hair and being abrasive. She explained it to me like this (I'm paraphrasing): You know how when you go swimming in the ocean (or gulf or whatever salt-water body of choice) and your wet hair dries its a little bit crunchy and clumpy? That's from the salt. \n\nScience time: Sulfates are derived from sulfuric acid. They are in a wide range of products, but their primary application is as a lathering or cleansing agent. You know how shampoos that have sulfates lather really really well and sulfate-free ones don't? That's why. Sulfate's purpose in this universe is to clean things and its really good at it. For a person with non-damaged, non-chemically treated a shampoo with sulfates is probably fine. \n\nHowever, for anyone with a compromised cuticle (the outer part of the hair strand; this includes anyone with color or chemical treatment) sulfates are sketchy because they're *too*  good at their job. Most clarifying shampoos just have a lot of sulfates in them.\n\nBottom Line: Your hair isn't gonna fall out or melt off and using the shampoo won't completely strip your treatment out all at once. But sulfates and sodium chloride will decrease the longevity of your treatment. Probably by 25-50%, depending on how frequently you wash your hair.\n\nNB: someone please fact-check my science, chemistry was a reeeaaaaallllly long time ago.",

Slow healing Generally have some clogged pores/comedones plus a couple hormonal nodules every month. Usually some ongoing PIH+PIE (red-brown acne marks) from that.\n\nAllergic/reactive to strongly fragranced skincare, shea butter, MCI/MI (a relatively uncommon preservative). Mineral oil and lanolin suit my skin a lot better than plant oils.\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Climate:** Mumbai. Hot and humid summers.\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Current routine:**\n\n‚òÄÔ∏è AM: \n+ Acne Squad Kick-Start Cleanser\n+ DIY vitamin c serum ([details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/eIi64ptr8k)) with glycerin and green tea extract added in to make it hydrating\n+ Dermadew Aloe cream [(review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/QCyo55E2rI) with a pinch of Purenso Colloidal Oatmeal powder (I skip the powder if wearing sunscreen, otherwise it causes pilling)\n+ Vilvah Melt-in-Milk SPF30 ([review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/hIPvg9vFiC)) if facing windows indoors or stepping out briefly, Vilvah SPF50 if spending time outdoors. Skip if entirely indoors.\n\nüåô PM: \n+ DIY cleansing balm (if wearing makeup)\n+ Simple Refreshing Face Wash\n+ Minimalist AHA BHA 10% exfoliator OR Minimalist 3% Tranexamic Acid Face Serum (or a skip day if I feel my skin needs it)\n+ Dermadew Aloe cream with a pinch of Purenso Colloidal Oatmeal powder mixed in (also over the lips)\n+ 100% lanolin as an occlusive balm - dabbed on the lips, healing acne spots, and (if sleeping in AC or feeling like my skin is sensitised) a thin overall layer by rubbing between the palms and gently pressing all over the face.\n\nNote that I built up to this routine of actives by introducing them one at a time, over the course of several weeks.\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Age:** Early 30s\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Usage timeline:** just under a month, every morning.\n\nThe brand directs you to use it daily, AM/PM, which is a bit confusing - does that mean twice a day? ü§î\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏èIngredient list: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Sodium chloride, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Acrylates Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Coconut Acid, Fragrance, Terpineol, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-6, Citric Acid, Salicylic Acid, PEG-150 Distearate, Thymol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Butylhydroxytoluene, Sodium hydroxide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Saccharide Isomerate, Linalool.\n\nNotably, contains an unspecified percentage of salicylic acid (looks like 0.5% if we speculate that phenoxyethanol is 1% and the ingredients are in decreasing order) and what they call their \"patented Thymol T Essence‚Ñ¢\" which is a botanical extract that has antimicrobial properties.\n\nIs sulphate- and paraben-free, does contain fragrance, linalool, terpineol and thymol as potentially sensitising ingredients.\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Claims and expectations:**\n\n>A gentle, sulphate-free cleanser created with Thymol T Essence‚Ñ¢ & Salicylic Acid, clinically proven to reduce acne causing bacteria & soothe acne in 3 days. Restores moisture leaving skin hydrated with Pentavitin‚Ñ¢ molecules.\n\nThe \"soothing acne\" and whole Acne Squad approach with their stages of acne was what got me interested, because yeah, when you're acne-prone it's a cycle that is naturally always ongoing. That seemed realistic to me, I appreciate that. I had been using a 2% salicylic cleanser in the daytime (Zitcare foaming face wash) and was curious to see if a cleanser with less salicylic that had a different antimicrobial action would be more effective and maybe work better for my sensitive skin? \n\nThis proved to not be the case üôÉ\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Price:** MRP ‚Çπ325 for 100ml (always available at reduced price of under 300)\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏èTexture, consistency and fragrance\n\nThe texture is like most other foaming cleansers that come in a tube, but not super thick. It's a clear gel that makes a soft and fine foam when rubbed between damp hands. Does not lather a lot, but enough to satisfy those of us who need the foamy feeling üòÇ\n\nIt has a fresh, herby-spicy fragrance that is characteristically from thyme. Quite mild, doesn't linger at all and only lasts for a few seconds when massaged on a wet face and rinsed.\n\nThose who like the smell of tea tree, rosemary or similar green fragrances would like it. Maybe even people who like minty/menthol face washes. I personally really enjoy a herby fragrance, so I enjoyed using it every morning ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è Packaging - a very cute lilac tube. Looks and feels great, but at least initially, the products tends to run out and it dispenses too much just with gravity. It's better to open it with the cap upwards and then flip it down to dispense. A small detail, but mildly annoying at first.\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏èEffects\n\nFoams quickly and applies very smoothly on a qet face - no dragging at all. The foam only lasts a few seconds after application on the face, and quickly disappears.\n\nThe result is a nicely cleansed face that isn't too stripped of oils. Using a smaller amount gives a gentler cleanser, and using more gives a stronger cleanse. \n\nHere's my problem - after about two weeks of using it daily in the mornings, I started experiencing mild barrier damage and redness. Especially around the nose corners (a tell-tale sign for those with sensitive skin). My skin texture became slightly bumpy all over, and I saw a few pinrpick pustules. Initially I figured I'd just dial back the exfoliation, but that didn't make a difference and eventually I stopped using this cleanser. Within two days my skin was back to normal and drinking up glycolic acid like nobody's business üòÇ\n\nJust goes to show, even sensitive skin is sensitive TO very particular things. I also use acids in my routine, so that might have had some impact, but I personally find that my skin likes acids and is more likely to react badly to botanical extracts in general. Just confirms that ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI didn't find it affected my acne in any way, but considering my skin's reaction, that doesn't mean much.\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏èFinal thoughts, pros and cons\n\nI actually really liked using this cleanser, and am somewhat disappointed it didn't work for me. I think it's a nice product, something of a level up from menthol type acne face washes of the past. A nice gateway product for men who are stuck on the \"for men\" train to try normal skincare üòÇ\n\nI think it would probably work quite well for people of all sebum levels, oily, combo, even dry if used in small amounts. \n\nNormal and resilient skin types would probably find it works well. If you're not using any serums or treatments for acne, I think it's worth a shot to see if this cleanser helps.\n\nIf you have sensitive skin I would use with caution, especially if you already know your skin reacts badly to essential oils, since the extracts are key constituents of those. This doesn't guarantee it won't work for you, just a heads up to keep an eye on your skin (like I did - no real harm done).\n\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Repurchase status:**\n\nSadly, a WNRP. One of those products that I know a majority of people will probably like, but just doesn't suit me personally. Anyway, I think I can just skip a treatment cleanser in the mornings now (and save it for summer mornings, when I have more oiliness).\n\nI'd love to hear from others who have used this product! Searching the sub didn't bring up any full reviews, is why I chose to post, but I know there's people out there using it. See you in the comments!",

I shaved the underside and deep conditioned with every wash it because it was all broken off, started washing my hair less (once every 3 or 4 days now), stopped using heat products, get haircuts every 8-10 weeks, and  tried buying better shampoos/conditioners for my hair.\n\n\nAt that time, I bought an olive oil shampoo/conditioner pair from Regis Designline and it seemed to work well. I've used it for a year now and my hair seems tired of it, so I tried purchasing some new ones after asking my hair dresser for a suggestion. I've tried Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Moisturizing Shampoo ( which is supposedly sulfate free and has argon oil in it) and also Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny line. Healthy Sexy Hair made my hair feel strawlike and Paul Mitchell's made it oily within a day, and feels almost waxy when it's drying. \n\n\nI've never dyed or permed my hair and have med-course and straight-wavy hair. I'm half Cambodian, half white, so I'm wondering if my hair chemistry is different from what they make products for. When doing at home masks, my hair seems to like olive oil. Since trying these shampoos, my hair has gotten frizzier, I've noticed new split ends that weren't there before, and is more tangled.

There are lots of wavy girls over there that could help you out.  \n\n\nEdit: I forgot to say to keep away from sulfates and silicones for sure. Sulfates are harsh and damaging.

Once a day using an electronic cleansing brush. \n\n-------------------\n\nSo here's a bit of skin background story (sorry it's kind of lengthy):\n\nAll through high school and my first 2 years of college, I was lucky to have clear skin. The only products I alternated between were Neutrogena Rapid Clear Foaming Scrub (more often) and Pink Grapefruit. Sometimes my skin felt quite dry after using these, but I didn't use a moisturizer. \n\nIn about my third year of college, I started using the hydro boost moisturizing gel from Neutrogena, which I felt made my skin too oily.\n\nAround this time, I also wanted to try changing skin care to focus on my pores/blackheads, so I was trying couple a couple Biore skin washes, which included: COMBINATION SKIN\nBALANCING CLEANSER (not really used), PORE PENETRATING CHARCOAL BAR (most frequently used), and WARMING ANTI-BLACKHEAD CLEANSER.\n\n\nAfter switching, I noticed a break out on my cheek, nothing too bad, but I am a picker. After about ~2 months, I decided to switch back to my Neutrogena face wash, but the breakouts stayed, and my skin has continued to get worse into my 4th year of college. \n\n-------------------\n\nSKIN ROUTINE TODAY:\n\nToday, I have switched to a Dr. Murad Routine of: Clarifying Cleanser, Post-Acne Spot Lightening Gel, Acne Spot Treatment, and Correcting Moisturizer. \n\nMurad products info:\n\nCleanser: \nActive Ingredient: Salicylic Acid 1.5%\nOther Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Methyl Gluceth-20, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Butylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract, Silver Citrate, Menthol, PEG-150 Distearate, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch Octenylsuccinate, Glyceryl Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Polysorbate 80, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylisothiazolinone, Limonene*, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Leaf Oil, Cymbopogon Nardus (Citronella) Oil, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Lavandula Hybrida Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nSpot Treatment:\nACTIVE INGREDIENT: Sulfur 3.0% \nOTHER INGREDIENTS: Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid, Sclerotium Gum, Dicaprylyl Maleate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Ceteareth-20, Glycerin, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Zinc Acetate, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Salicylic Acid, Lecithin, Tocopherol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Palmitoyl Hydroxypropyltrimonium Amylopectin/Glycerin Crosspolymer, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben * Allergen\n\nMoisturizer:\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Avobenzone (3.00%), Homosalate (4.00%), Octisalate (5.00%)\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Water (Aqua), Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, PEG-100 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Polyester-8, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Urea, Yeast Amino Acids, Trehalose, Inositol, Taurine, Betaine, Phospholipids, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Punica Granatum Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lactic Acid, Panthenol, Linoleic Acid, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Aminomethyl Propanol, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Limonene, Citral, Fragrance (Parfum), Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 5 (CI 19140)\n\n-------------------\n\nI've been using it for a couple months (~2-3), and I still am not seeing results.

All the products I use and review here are completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no ‚Äúnatural‚Äù fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus, etc ). So here we go: \n\n**BEST**: \n\n1. **Acne.org cleanser**: this is my HG face cleanser that I have repurchased so many times. No matter how many products I try over the years, I always come back to this because it‚Äôs cost effective, works well without drying out my skin, and does not leave a residue behind. It has a gel texture and come in a pump bottle which make it super convenient to use. \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Disodium Cocamphodiacetate, Butylene Glycol, Sage Extract, Cucumber Extract, White Oak Bark Extract, Panthenol, Allantoin, Acrylates Copolymer, Methylgluceth-20, Polysorbate-20, Quaternium-15, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Face Cleanser:** This cleanser is one of my recent discovery and I like it a lot. It‚Äôs a little more pricey than the [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) cleanser, but it works well and is gentle on the skin. It comes in a tube which makes it convenient for travel. \n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Coconut Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Stearyl Alcohol, Allantoin,‚ÄØ‚ÄØChrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium PCA, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Maltodextrin,‚ÄØ Tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Soon Jung pH 5.5 Foam Cleanser:** This is a Korean product. It comes in a tube and does cleanse well, doesn‚Äôt over dry, and leaves no residue behind. Overall, this is a good cleanser. If you are looking for a good Korean water based cleanser, I would recommend this one. This would be best for people with normal to oily skin, IMO.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Coco -betaine, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Madecassoside\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WORST**: \n\n1. **Hada Labo Goku-jyun Foaming Face Wash:** This is probably the worse cleanser out of everything I tried in a long time. I decided to purchase this product to try because I like the oil cleanser from Hada Labo, but this one is a total let down! This cleanser come in a pump bottle, which makes it easy to dispense the product, but that‚Äôs the only pro. Now the cons: This foam cleanser does not cleanse well. For me, It‚Äôs too gentle on the skin, leave a greasy residue on my skin and made me break out. I believe the greasy feeling is due to the Vaseline in the formula. I think this cleanser will only work for people with dry to very dry skin, but even if you have dry skin, there are so many other better cleansers out there. Those of you with oily, acne-prone or combo skin, this product will be a disaster! So stay away!\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, BG, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, PEG-8, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium Taurine Cocoyl Methyltaurate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate(Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), **Vaseline**, Citric Acid, Polyquaternium-7, EDTA-2Na, BHT, Methylparaben\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SO-SO:**\n\n1. **Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser:** This is another Korean product. It comes in a pump bottle and is very convenient to use. However, this is a very average cleanser. It‚Äôs not the worst, but not the best either. It works and is gentle on the skin, but there‚Äôs nothing wow worthy about it. Also, there‚Äôs nothing it does that the other cleansers I mention above cannot do. I won‚Äôt be repurchasing this one. \n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola) Extract, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Protease, Leucine, Alanine, Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Proline, Valine, Isoleucine, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Histidine, Cysteine, Methionine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Benzoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate",

None of these leave my skin dry or tight. \n\n* **Simple Hydrating Cleansing Oil** - this is very nice for such a cheap product. My HG until I tried out fancier stuff. For drier and dehydrated skin that isn't acne prone, you could use this as a single cleanse. I have all winter. \n\n* **Clinique Take The Day Off Balm** - I got this as a sample pot and it's really cosmetically elegant. Lathers up beautifully. Very satisfying to use. Single cleanse works for me. \n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Radiance cleansing balm** - this is so fancy! Unlike the Clinique, it turns straight to an oil texture when you rub it in. I prefer that the Clinique is a slightly thicker texture when you rub it in personally but I'm trying a fermented skincare routine which is why I bought it. The packaging is amazing - it comes with a spatula in a little compartment in the lid! I'm not sure it emulsifies as well as the Clinique so I double cleanse my T-zone to be safe. \n\n* **Simple Refreshing Gel face wash** - very nice, good second cleanser. Cheap but effective. Also Fungal Acne safe according Folliculitis Scout but please check yourself. I use this as my second cleanser on my T-zone and my sole cleanser on my neck/upper chest.",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: While this product, produced and distributed by Amazon as a house brand, stands out for its cost-effectiveness, it does contain certain ingredients that may be of concern to some parents. It features 2 synthetic color additives and 1 fragrance for aesthetic and olfactory appeal. The synthetic additive D&C Yellow No. 10, aimed at delivering a visually appealing color, can increase sun sensitivity amongst other side effects. Moreover, the additive 'Fragrance', incorporated for an appealing scent, could potentially induce respiratory and eczema issues in certain infants. Hence, parents who are apprehensive about these potential side effects should be cautious while considering this product for use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, PEG-80 sorbitan laurate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium laureth sulfate, PEG-150 distearate, fragrance, tetrasodium EDTA, polyquaternium-10, PEG-175 diisostearate, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, yellow 10, orange 4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Peg-80 Sorbitan Laurate\n   * PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate is a surfactant and emulsifier that's often used in cosmetics and personal care products, including baby shampoos. It helps to mix oil and water-based ingredients, and can help to cleanse the skin and hair by helping water to mix with oil and dirt, allowing them to be rinsed away.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: While PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate is generally considered safe, some individuals might experience skin irritation or an allergic reaction, such as redness, itching, or a rash. However, these instances are relatively rare.\n      * Eye Irritation: As with any soap product, there is a potential for eye irritation if the product gets into the eyes. This can lead to discomfort and temporary redness. It's always important to avoid the eye area when using shampoo.\n      * Environmental Considerations: PEGs (polyethylene glycols), including PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, are petroleum-based compounds, and there are concerns about their biodegradability and impact on the environment.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Cocamidopropyl Betaine\n   * Cocamidopropyl betaine is a surfactant commonly used in personal care products, including baby lotions, due to its mild cleansing and foaming properties. It is generally well-tolerated and considered safe for use. However, in some rare cases, individuals may experience certain side effects.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Although uncommon, some individuals may be sensitive or allergic to cocamidopropyl betaine. This can lead to skin irritation or allergic reactions such as redness, itching, rash, or hives. If your baby develops any of these symptoms after using a baby lotion containing cocamidopropyl betaine, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.\n      * Eye Irritation: Direct contact of cocamidopropyl betaine with the eyes may cause mild eye irritation. It is important to avoid contact with the eyes and rinse thoroughly with water if accidental exposure occurs.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)\n   * Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) is a common ingredient used in many cleaning and hygiene products, including shampoos, body washes, and toothpastes. It's a surfactant, a type of compound that helps create lather and makes a product more effective at removing dirt and oils. In baby shampoos, SLES is often used because it's milder and less irritating to the skin and eyes than some other types of surfactants, like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). Nonetheless, there has been ongoing debate about the safety of SLES, especially in products used on babies and young children.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: SLES can be irritating to the skin, especially if left on for extended periods of time or used in high concentrations. This can lead to redness, dryness, or itching. People with sensitive skin or skin conditions such as eczema may be more prone to these effects.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product containing SLES gets into the eyes, it can cause irritation, resulting in redness and discomfort.\n      * Possible Contamination with 1,4-Dioxane: During the manufacturing process of SLES, it can potentially be contaminated with 1,4-Dioxane, a substance that has been classified as a possible human carcinogen. However, this is generally at extremely low levels, if present at all, and most manufacturers have processes in place to remove this contaminant.\n      * Environmental Impact: There are some concerns about the environmental impact of SLES, particularly its potential for bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* PEG-150 Distearate\n   * PEG-150 Distearate is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) ester of stearic acid. It's commonly used in personal care products, including baby wipes, as an emulsifier, thickener, or cleansing agent. While PEG-150 Distearate is generally considered safe for use in personal care products, there are potential side effects.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In rare cases, some individuals might experience minor skin irritation or an allergic reaction such as redness, itching, or a rash. This is more likely if the individual has sensitive skin.\n      * Eye Irritation: As with many ingredients in shampoo and other personal care products, PEG-150 Distearate could cause eye irritation if the product gets into the eyes.\n      * Potential Contamination: There's a low risk of PEG-150 Distearate being contaminated with potentially harmful substances during manufacturing, such as 1,4-dioxane or ethylene oxide, both of which have been associated with health risks. However, most manufacturers have rigorous processes in place to ensure that such contaminants, if present, are at safe levels.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Phenoxyethanol\n   * Phenoxyethanol is used as a preservative in cosmetic products and also as a stabilizer in perfumes and soaps. Exposure to phenoxyethanol has been linked to reactions ranging from eczema to severe, life-threatening allergic reactions. Infant oral exposure to phenoxyethanol can acutely affect nervous system function.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some cases, phenoxyethanol can cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction, presenting as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin and may be more susceptible to such reactions.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though less common, some people may experience an allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol, which could result in symptoms like hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Eczema: It is also a common allergic reaction to skin exposure of products containing one percent or more phenoxyethanol. Reactions only occur in the area of application and eczema subsides after avoidance of the product causing irritation.\n      * Acute nervous system effects (infants): In 2008, the FDA warned consumers not to purchase Mommy‚Äôs Bliss Nipple Cream. Phenoxyethanol, found in the cream, was depressing the central nervous system and causing vomiting and diarrhea in breast feeding infants. Symptoms of a depressed nervous system include a decrease in infant‚Äôs appetite, difficulty waking the infant, limpness of extremities and change in skin color. There is no known health risk to the mother.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Peg 175 Diisostearate\n   * PEG-175 Diisostearate is a type of polyethylene glycol (PEG) ester of isostearic acid, and it's commonly used as an emulsifier or surfactant in personal care products, including baby lotions. While PEG-175 Diisostearate is generally considered safe for use in personal care products, there are potential side effects.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience skin irritation when using products containing PEG-175 Diisostearate. This could present as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin, so they may be more susceptible to such irritation.\n      * Allergic Reactions: While not common, some people may have an allergic reaction to PEG-175 Diisostearate, which could result in symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Hydroxide\n   * Sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda or lye, is a strong alkaline compound that is sometimes used in the manufacturing process of personal care products, including baby lotions. It is used to adjust the pH of the formulation to ensure stability and efficacy. However, it is important to note that sodium hydroxide itself is not typically listed as an active ingredient in baby lotions, but rather used in very small amounts for pH adjustment purposes.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Sodium hydroxide, if present in higher concentrations, can cause skin irritation in some individuals. This may manifest as redness, itching, burning sensation, or rash. It is important to discontinue use if your baby experiences any of these symptoms and consult a healthcare professional.\n      * Eye Irritation: Direct contact of baby lotion containing sodium hydroxide with the eyes can cause mild to moderate eye irritation. It is crucial to avoid contact with the eyes and rinse thoroughly with water if accidental exposure occurs.\n      * Chemical Burns: Sodium hydroxide is a caustic substance and can cause chemical burns if used undiluted or in high concentrations. However, in properly formulated baby lotions, the concentration of sodium hydroxide is typically low and safe for use.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* D&C Orange No. 4\n   * D&C Orange No. 4 is a synthetic color additive that is often used in personal care products to give them a certain color. The \"D&C\" indicates that it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in drugs and cosmetics, but not in food. While D&C Orange No. 4 is generally considered safe for use in cosmetic products, there are potential side effects.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Like many ingredients in personal care products, D&C Orange No. 4 could potentially cause skin irritation in some individuals. This might manifest as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin and may be more susceptible to such reactions.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though less common, some individuals may experience an allergic reaction to D&C Orange No. 4, which could result in symptoms like hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Sensitivity to Sunlight: Some artificial colorants can make skin more sensitive to sunlight, which could increase the risk of sunburn.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* D&C Yellow No. 10\n   * D&C Yellow No. 10 is a synthetic color additive that's used in certain drugs, cosmetics, and other personal care products. It's used to give products a specific color. The \"D&C\" denotes that the color additive is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in drugs and cosmetics, but not in food.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience skin irritation when using products containing D&C Yellow No. 10. This could present as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin, so they may be more susceptible to such irritation.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though not common, some people may have an allergic reaction to D&C Yellow No. 10, which could result in symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Sensitivity to Sunlight: Some synthetic colorants may make skin more sensitive to sunlight, which could increase the risk of sunburn.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fragrance\n   * \"Fragrance\" in the ingredient list of baby lotions (and other personal care products) is often a catch-all term for a mix of various scent-producing chemicals. Fragrances can make products smell pleasant, but they can also cause some potential side effects, especially in people with sensitive skin or allergies. In babies, who generally have more sensitive skin than adults, these side effects might include.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Allergic Reactions: Although it's not common, some babies might have an allergic reaction to certain fragrances, which could lead to symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing. These reactions might not occur the first time the baby is exposed to the fragrance, but could develop after repeated use.\n      * Sensitization: Regular exposure to certain fragrances can lead to the development of a sensitivity over time, where the body starts reacting to a substance that it was previously okay with. This can lead to allergic contact dermatitis, a type of eczema.\n      * Respiratory Issues: Inhaling some fragrances can trigger respiratory symptoms, particularly in babies with asthma or other pre-existing respiratory conditions.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

    "body": "I have very thick/dense wavy hair (not fine or coarse, just lots of hair) and have been transitioning to co/low poo. None of my hair has ever been bleached, dyed, or chemically straightened, and I have used heat on it exactly once in the few years it's been since I shaved it all off. My scalp tends to be oily, and I get mild flakes which I've used T-Gel to combat for most of my life. \n\nMy current routine is a weekly shampoo with SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Shampoo, and daily/every-other day co-wash with either SE Strawberry or HE Freesia. Plop for 15-30 minutes (I get distracted), sometimes use some Raw Shea & Cupua√ßu Frizz Defense Styling Gel-Cream when it's damp.\n\nI'm wondering what ingredients are different to make me enjoy using SE, and dislike using HE. I can't actually *see* any difference on the days I use one or the other (so I should probably use HE for a week or two and see if there's a visible difference) but the texture, slip, and feel of HE is much nicer in my hair. \n\nComparing the ingredients with the copy&paste website, SE has Propylene Glycol as \"approved with caution\" and Cetyl Alcohol  as \"approved\". HE has Hydrolyzed Keratin, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, and Panthenol as \"approved with caution\" and Cetyl Alcohol and Stearyl Alcohol as \"approved\"\n\n\n\n. | Approved | Approved with caution\n---|---|----\nSuave Essentials | Cetyl Alcohol | Propylene Glycol\nHerbal Escapes | Cetyl Alcohol  | Propylene Glycol\n. | Stearyl Alcohol | Glycerin\n. | . | Hydrolyzed Keratin\n. | . | Panthenol\n\nSo, in an ideal world, this would mean that Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, or Panthenol are what is making the V05 feel icky. \n\nI have a feeling it isn't that simple.\n\nIf I could put this under a cut, I would, but this is V05 Herbal Escapes *Water (Aqua, EAU), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Glyceryl Stearate, DMDM Hydantoin, Linalool, Disodium EDTA, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Ext.

    "body": "\n**Basic Info** \n\nL'oreal Oleo Therapy Oil Infused Shampoo is 8.5 fl oz for $6.99 on Ulta's website.  \"Introducing OleoTherapy, our first replenishing system for dull, dry or damaged hair. Formulated with a 6 flower oil blend, our system provides intense nutrition and shine. Hair is restored to smooth and silky.\"\n\n\n**Ingredients** (as listed on product):\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoamphopropionate, Cocamide Mipa, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Propylene Glycol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate, Decyl Glucoside, PEG-150 Distearate, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Trisodium Ethylendiamine Disuccinate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Methyl Cocoate, Hydroxycitronellal, Sodium Cocoate, Argania Spinosa Oil/Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Cocos Nucifera Oil/Coconut Oil, Isoeugenol, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita Extract/Matricaria Flower Extract, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Cl 19140/Yellow 5, Methylisothiazolinone, Cl 15510/Orange 4, Gardenia Tahitensis Flower Extract, Rosa Canina Flower Extract, Nelumbium Speciosum Extract/Nelumbium Speciosum Flower Extract, Linum Usitatissimum Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n\n**Price**\n\n$6.99\n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nAlmost Anywhere in the US! I've found it at Ulta, Walgreens, Walmart, Kmart, etc.\n\n\n**How to Use**\n\nJust a normal shampoo- lather and rinse.\n\n**Pros**\n\nIt smells good, it's available in many stores(not hard to find), rinsed out- didn't leave buildup, \n\n**Cons**\n\nDried the everyloving sh*t out of my hair. The first few uses seemed okay, but then my hair just panicked. I haven't used it for two weeks and am still trying to get my hair to recover. :(\n\n**Overall**\n\nJust like all of the other L'oreal shampoos(even the sulfate-free ones) I don't recommend this product.  It took a while before my hair really showed the damage it was doing, but it is seriously parched now. I'm doing deep conditioning treatments, pre-pooing with oils, etc.   I wanted to try it because it's cheaper than my SheaMoisture and more readily available, but it is not worth it.  I did try the conditioner also but wasn't wowed- it felt a bit waxy to me.\n",

If anyone wants to check out the website, it's [here](http://purelyprofessional.dk/) but a warning.

Your hair is wavy so if you wanted to go CG method you could. I put both of these in and the shampoo is approved with caution (meaning some ingredients might not work for everyone but if it works for you keep using it) and the conditioner was not approved based on the inclusion of Isododecane which is not a silicone but it is insoluble in water and can act as one in the sense that it can prevent your hair from getting ‚Äúreal‚Äù moisture.\n\nOverall that being the only unapproved ingredient tells me these are probably alright to be using and shouldn‚Äôt damage your hair or dry it out. If you notice any product buildup or your roots being more oily than normal you can use a clarifying treatment and if your hair seems like it‚Äôs still not getting moisturized from the shaft down you could try getting a deep conditioning mask to do once or twice a week. If all else fails you could just switch to a new shampoo and conditioner after you use these up.",

It would be a little harsher on hair than the kinky moves, but a lot of people can't cowash.\n\nIf you can't cowash, try alternating cowashing with low poo (both the curl defining and love for hue shampoos are low poos). That will help keep your color fresh and your curls moisturized.",

    "body": "Hey! So I read/skimmed through the guidebook in the highlighted section of the reddit page but I'm a tad confused on some things (terminologies and budget wise stuff).\n\nSo, I've been trying to get into caring for my hair a bit more. I have tried for the past 3-ish years (after a relaxer treatment I had) to keep my hair as healthy as possible. It's basically one of the only things that gives me a confidence boost. My hair is currently at waist length and I'm not quite sure if its \"healthy\". Over the years its been really difficult to care for or in general deal with and with its current length its been really overwhelming. I usually don't mind caring for it and I don't really want to cut it as its really important to me.\n\nand thus why I'm here! I'm currently on a budget but I have a few items already (I'm not sure how to use them or when and everywhere I go I get a different answer), I don't care much about the styling as much as I care about it being healthy (for example I have gone and box braided it multiple times before - my hair is 3A I'm pretty sure with varying types in a few spots like behind my ears and I think it can be classified as fine hair).\n\n  \nthe items I have currently are: (I'll include the ingredients since its not a popular brand worldwide)   \n\n\n\\- shampoo 1: Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Potassium Laureth-4 Carboxylate, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool.\n\n  \n\\- shampoo 2: Aqua, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Lactic Acid, PPG-3 Caprylyl Ether, Hydrolyzed Pearl, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n\n\n\\- hair mask: Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil (Almond Oil), Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan Oil), Glycerin, Pearl Powder, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Sodium PCA, Proline, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sodium Lactate, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n  \n\\- Conditioner: Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, PPG-3 Caprylyl Ether, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Pearl, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Cetearyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Sodium PCA, Proline, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sodium Lactate, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n\n\n\\- Leave-in cream: Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Dioleoylethyl Hydroxyethylmonium Methosulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene.\n\n  \nit might be worth noting I do have a detangling spray but I rarely use it  \nI don't exactly have any oils as Ive never known how to use them unlike the hair mask (I usually put it on wet hair and let it sit for 30mins - an hour with a cap on)\n\n  \nI do have other shampoos like head and shoulders and dollar store shampoos ofc but I also have a \"final wash shampoo\" which I'm not too sure what to do with: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-10, Potassium Sorbate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n  \nI don't exactly know what I need more let alone how to use what I already have. I do know I should get my ends trimmed soon but I want to try and keep as much of the length as possible/repair the hair. Please if anyone can help me figure out what to do or how to fix this please help.",

They are usually made up of up to thousands of individual ingredients that the company doesn't have to list. Many of the ingredients contain allergens or toxins which can irritate the skin and also damage your skin's natural collagen. \n\nAlso, when looking for a new product, make sure to be aware of Mineral Oil. Mineral oil just sits on the skin, doesn't allow your skin to breath, and also does not allow other ingredients to penetrate your skin. However, mineral oil is in so many lotions because it is a cheap ingredient.\n\nThose are the two main ingredients I watch out for, but I know nothing of the other ingredients. If another ingredient is irritating your skin, you might want to opt for an all-natural moisturizer such as coconut oil, olive oil, grapeseed oil, among many others.",

Residual make up [may increase irritation.] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2380419/What-sleeping-make-does-skin-Our-shocking-experiment-exposes-happens.html) If you wear much make up you might add a fragrance free oil based/ silicone based/ dual phase eye make up remover, these are often gentle enough to use on a larger area but do try to ind out the pH.\n\nYour first anti ageing product is sunscreen, all mineral is better or hypersensitive skin. I rate Derma-e Antioxidant Natural sunscreen SPF 30 which has 1% green tea extract and a little vitamin C (SAP form). The body version is a larger pack size than the face version.\n\nDifferent moisturiser ... CeraVe PM Lotion is fragrance free, light enough for under make up,  4% niacinamide is suited to many skin conditions and has anti ageing properties.",
