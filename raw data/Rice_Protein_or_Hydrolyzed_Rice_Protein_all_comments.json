        "body": "Hi all! I'm a little over a month in to the curly girl method and decided to do a DIY rice water protein treatment. WOWZA - the difference it made!\n\nMy Usual Routine:  I co washed with tresemmé botanique nourish and replenish conditioner. I then condition with the same, rinse most out*, comb upside and kinda outwards for the sides and back (otherwise it sticks upside down to my head) and lots of LA Extreme sports gel using praying hands and squishing, plop for 10 minutes, diffuse for another 10-20 min, with attention to making sure I lift my roots.\n\nToday: same as above, but before getting in the shower, I followed Curly Cailin recipe and instructions for making rice water, and I mixed the results with some of my conditioner. I hopped in the shower to co wash and then hopped out. Squeezed water out of my hair and then thoroughly saturated with the rice water-conditioner mixture. I tied it up and had it in a shower cap for 30 min. Get back in the shower, rinse it all out (I definitely found some rice in my hair lol), put a bit more conditioner in my hair to detangle, and picked up where you see * above with my normal routine.\n\nOoh la la, what a difference it makes! :)",

        "body": "You can get a big bag of puffed rice or rice bubbles for really cheap, and this recipe can be made with things you probably already have in your pantry. Especially when you consider the price of protein balls or bars this is a tasty and cheap alternative to try. You can top it with chocolate, nuts or in my case Milo, and change up the flavour by using different protein powders or nut butters. \n\nIngredients: \n• 1/2 cup peanut butter \n• 1/4 cup sticky sweetener (I used honey but you can also try maple, rice malt or agave syrup)\n• 2 scoops protein powder (I used salted caramel)\n• 3 tablespoons oil (I used olive but you can use coconut oil)\n• 2 cups puffed rice\n• Optional - sprinkle of Milo (it’s a chocolate and malt powder) \n\n1. Place peanut butter, sticky sweetener and oil in microwave for ten second intervals, stirring in between until combined\n2. Stir through protein powder until smooth\n3. Fold through puffed rice, add in any extra ingredients if it is too dry\n4. Flatten into lined tray and add in any toppings \n5. Refrigerate until firm and slice into portions",

        "body": "My only qualm with Ripple which keeps me from purchasing it, is its 4th ingredient being vegetable oil (sunflower or safflower oil).  \n  \nFurthermore, the ingredients show that Ripple is essentially just water, cane sugar, vegetable oil, vitamins (who knows the quality of such), and thickeners, with pea protein added to it.  \n  \nIt’s hard to find a non-vegetable/seed oil milk without fillers but sometimes in the non-refrigerated milk section (think boxed milk) you can find some decent high protein milks with a low list of ingredients. Off the top of my head I think hemp milk and macadamia milk contain a non-negligible amount of protein.  \n  \nMy personal favorite milk alternative is  the Vanilla MALK. It’s almond milk with a total of 4 or 5 ingredients (water, almonds, salt, and vanilla extract I believe) - also I think it’s organic? Can’t remember. Oh but it has like hardly any protein in it :/\n  \n———  \n  \nOne other recommendation I have is upper your fiber content by a lot.  \n  \nYour gut microbiome LOVES fiber and ever since I’ve consciously been upping my fiber [trying (and more often than not failing) to hit ~50g of dietary fiber a day], I’ve noticed a stark difference in my overall gut health. I’ve experienced less bloating, better stools, and some foods that typically upset my stomach, don’t, if they have a bed of fiber in my stomach to fall onto :). \n  \nOvernight oats, chia seeds, flax meal, vegan protein cereal (‘3 Wishes’ has a VERY good chocolate one, and the company is woman owned which is always a plus in my book), veggies, dried fruits and nuts, and legumes (mostly lentils and BEANS! For me :) ). \n  \nLet me know if you have any tips or questions!! I hope this was helpful!  \n  \nEdit: AND OH! Those alternative pastas are sooo good. I haven’t tried the edamame one but I’ll grab it the next time I see it. The fava bean one is my fav - good texture too which the lack thereof is usually the problem I run into when buying alternative pastas.",

It can get pretty technical with all the chemistry. I found myself wishing that someone just made a checklist or flowchart or something that made it dead simple to choose.\n\n**So, here's my attempt at making it super easy to choose a protein powder.** \n\nI'm sharing this in case there's anyone out there who is also confused by all the choices out there. (And also if I got anything blatantly wrong. Help!)\n\n-----\n\n# “I just want the cheapest protein”\n* Get Whey Concentrate. \n* For most people, this is the way to go. It's vegetarian-friendly as well. If you’re just starting out and don’t have any dietary issues – get yourself a tub of whey concentrate!\n\n#“I’m lactose-intolerant“\n* Get Whey Isolate.\n* This is whey concentrate’s leaner and more refined brother; and in the process of refinement, it becomes friendly for the lactose-intolerant.\n\n#“I’m vegan“\n* Get Soy Protein.\n* It’s a complete protein with comparable macro stats to whey isolate.\n\n#“I’m vegan and I have soy allergies”\n* Get a blended Rice/Pea Protein.\n* Rice Protein and Pea Protein are incomplete protein sources on their own, but become a complete protein when combined. \n\n#“I’m vegan and I have a sensitive stomach”\n* Get Rice Protein.\n* Rice protein is hypo-allergenic; and as a plant-based protein powder, it’s also gluten-free. \n* However: rice protein is not a complete protein on its own\n\n#“I’m on Paleo / Keto / need super low-carb“\n* Get Egg Protein.\n* A complete protein source with a great macro profile: egg protein supplements are usually based solely off egg whites. It’s all protein and nearly zero carbs.\n\n#“I need a slow-digesting protein”\n* Get Casein Protein.\n* Casein is for people who are serious enough about their diet to be thinking about slow-digesting proteins :) slow-digesting proteins like Casein provide your body a steady supply of protein over a longer period of time (contrast this with whey, which is absorbed quickly)\n\n---\n\n*Updates based on comments: removed mention of \"all\" plant proteins being incomplete (not true b/c of Soy); removed separate bullet for Vegetarians; changed vegan #1 choice to Soy; added rice/pea blend as reco for Vegans w/ soy allergies*",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

What I have found to work the most for me  has been a monthly Glycolic peel (20%) coupled with regular (2-3 times a week) exfoliating and of course niacinamide and Alpha arbutin and sunscreen that blocks against HEV and IR  to stop new pigmentation from forming. It's a nightmare to maintain  but it was the only thing that works. I did try tret, the 0.5 one but it was really really drying on my skin and darkened my pigmentation unless I exfoliated which made it more dry. Such a pita.",

Listen up, Huel, I've been around the block more times than your delivery truck.\n\nI've been a Hueligan since you guys were figuring out if you should spell it 'Huel' or 'Hewel.' I've got more Huel loyalty points than you've got grains of rice protein in that bag. And now, after years of my patronage, you have the audacity to tell me that I'm 'now a Hueligan'?\n\n I have been loyal when you guys went through the 'New and Improved Flavor' phase. I stood by you when everyone else was raving about Soylent, making jokes about how Huel sounds like something a frat boy yells before puking.\n\nThat's like telling LeBron he's 'now a basketball player' after his fourth championship. You’re like a parent forgetting their kid’s birthday. I’ve been a Hueligan since Huel was just a baby idea in someone's head.\n\nLook, I've been mixing and shaking longer than your social media intern has been alive. I’ve been through every 'limited edition' flavor you've put out. Heck, my dog's name is Huelbert, for crying out loud. And you want to greet me like it's my first day on Planet Huel?\n\nDo you comprehend the level of my Hueliness? I don't just 'consume' Huel, okay? I EXPERIENCE it. I've made Huel pancakes, Huel ice cream, Huel smoothies topped with a sprinkle of crushed Huel bars. I've even hosted an all-Huel Thanksgiving dinner, which not only made my family question my sanity but also question the very foundation of culinary traditions. That's right, I've become a disruptive force in the Hueliverse.\n\nYou owe the OG Hueligans a bit more respect. A VIP badge. A hall of fame. Something! But telling me I'm 'now a Hueligan' is like telling a fish it’s now wet. ",

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

Talk about burying the lede (all bolds mine):\n\n>Researchers at the University of Washington had collaborated with scientists at USDA, as well as others in Japan, China and Australia, for more than two years to study **how rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could affect rice — humanity’s most important crop. They found that it not only loses protein and minerals, but is also likely to lose key vitamins as plants adapt to a changing environment.**\n\n...\n\n>Several earlier studies had already shown that rice loses protein, zinc and iron under the elevated CO2 levels that scientists predict for later this century, raising potentially serious concerns for hundreds of millions of people who are highly dependent on rice and already at risk of food insecurity. This latest study by ARS and its academic partners around the world had confirmed those previous findings and — for the first time — found that vitamins can also drop out of rice in these conditions.\n\n...\n\n>Among the ARS studies that did not receive publicity from the Agriculture Department are:  \n  \n>  \n>A 2017 finding that climate change was likely to increase agricultural pollution and nutrient runoff in the Lower Mississippi River Delta, but that certain conservation practices, including not tilling soil and planting cover crops, would help farmers more than compensate and bring down pollutant loads regardless of the impacts of climate change.  \n>  \n>A January 2018 finding that the Southern Plains — the agriculture-rich region that stretches from Kansas to Texas — is increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, from the crops that rely on **the waning Ogallala aquifer** to the cattle that graze the grasslands.  \n>  \n>An April 2018 finding that **elevated CO2 levels lead to “substantial and persistent” declines in the quality of certain prairie grasses that are important for raising cattle**. **The protein content in the grass drops as photosynthesis kicks into high gear due to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere** — a trend that could pose health problems for the animals and cost ranchers money.  \n>  \n>A July 2018 finding that coffee, which is already being affected by climate change, can potentially help scientists figure out how to evaluate and respond to the complex interactions between plants, pests and a changing environment. **Rising CO2 in the atmosphere is projected to alter pest biology, such as by making weeds proliferate or temperatures more hospitable to damaging insects.**  \n>  \n>An October 2018 finding, in conjunction with the USDA Forest Service, that climate change would likely lead to more runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed during certain seasons.  \n>  \n>A March 2019 finding that **increased temperature swings might already be boosting pollen to the point that it’s contributing to longer and more intense allergy seasons across the northern hemisphere.** “This study, done across multiple continents, highlights an important link between ongoing global warming and public health—one that could be exacerbated as temperatures continue to increase,” the researchers wrote.",

Just like the central valley in CA, farmers just kept drilling deeper wells, without thinking (or caring) why the water was retreating that much - their livelihood depended on them ignoring that depletion. Someone else's problem later on is what they thought, if they even gave it a thought. \n\nAnd here we are.",

Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better!

So I thought maybe the scar stick could be an interesting thing to try. It’s amazing. I do feel like it’s been helping even if just to be an extra occlusive layer. But I feel like my marionette lines have faded a little bit with consistent use. Sometimes I even use it as an occlusive layer over my lip balm. Idk it’s a really interesting multi stick. I could see it being a cool makeup primer.",

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "Greetings!\n \nWelcome to Coach Kyle's Frequently Answered Questions!\n \nHere, I touch base on the questions I most frequently answer. But, always wanting to learn, I want to have some dialog with YOU on what you think of the subject, practices you've put into place, and other questions you may have on this topic!\n \nYou can see past FAQ's here:\n\n* [Cross-training](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/6jsh1w/coach_kyles_faq_crosstraining/)\n* [Fueling Gear](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/6idlyf/coach_kyles_faq_fueling_gear/) \n* [Foot Strike](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/6e7pzj/coach_kyles_faqs_foot_strike/)\n* [Real Food Supplementation](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/6cucjt/coach_kyles_faqs_real_food_supplementation/)\n \nSo, let's chat!\n\n-----\n\nThis topic was a question from an athlete of mine and I thought it would make for an interesting discussion - what should we do *after* a run?!?\n\nWe can obviously break this down into a dozen different run scenarios but I’m going to start with the run that likely requires the most consideration, the early morning weekend long run :) \n\nI think, fairly typical this time of the year would be to head out around sunrise give or take some time. You execute a 2 - 3 hour run with some calories and hydration during.\n\nThen what?\n\n**Walk Back**\n\nThis is something I started doing a couple years ago during my long runs. During out and backs I would run out a bit farther than halfway so my watch would ding before getting back to the house, parking lot, etc. The reason for this was to add a little quarter mile walk on the end of my run.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, there’s nothing scientific about this practice. I suppose this would help lower your core temp more gradually than coming to a sudden stop. I simply find it a way to cool down a bit but more importantly I find it relaxing. I may enjoy a few minutes walking along the creek or through the neighborhood. If I ran with my phone I’ll log the run on the app. Maybe I'll look at the run splits on a GPS. I've been known to do some drills and lunges during the walkback as well.\n\n**Hydrate / Calories**\n\nIt goes without saying that getting a glass of water and/or milk (my post-workout recovery beverage) is what happens right when I enter the house or get to my car. We'll touch on nutrition a bit below, but I wanted to get this one out of the way.\n\n**Do some Strength & Mobility**\n\nIf you're familiar with Coach Jay Johnson, he recommends doing a light bodyweight routine immediately upon ending the run as an extension of the workout. The idea here is to in a way make the workout longer by keeping your heart rate up for an extra 5-15 minutes post-run. I hope I explained that correctly: By doing some [general strength & mobility](http://kylekranz.com/gsm) within a minute or two after ending your run you're still utilizing stored glycogen and fat, sweating, and working on strength! Doing it in a fatigued state, immediately upon ending a run, increases the simulation from an \"easy\" bodyweight routine as well. Pre-run lunges are easy, post run lunges are much more challenging...no weights necessary. \n\nWhen temps are above 45 degrees or so I'll typically do the GSM right outside my house. Here in Santiago de Chile when we're living in an apartment for a month I'll do my routines on the grass right out front or along the sidewalk before I go up to the apartment. I have found that doing GSM outside when it's very cold out is a challenge. When it's very warm out I'll run inside, grab a water, and then go right back out. Like the walkback, this may also help you gradually lower your core temp. \n\nAnother reason to do the GSM right after the run is that I feel it may increase adherence to the strengh/mobility program vs telling yourself you'll do it later in the afternoon or in the evening and hoping it happens.\n\nI'm not a big proponent of stretching, but I do stretch *when I feel the need to stretch a certain area*. I don't have any real stretching routines I suggest but if you simply feel the urge to stretch then please do.\n\n**Shovel the Sidewalk**\n\nYup, during the winter I almost always shovel the sidewalk right upon ending my morning run.\n\n**Log It**\n\nOne advantage of running with a phone is that you can immediately log the workout.\n\nWith my own athletes, I tell them even aside from distance+time there are the very important run characteristics of how it went and the perceived exertion, things that may be best recalled immediately after the run. Even when I log a run in my paper journal I do it immediately upon getting back home without even changing out of my shorts. \n\n**Don't Shower**\n\nOk, we're going to *eventually* shower, but bear with me.\n\nI know I'm not the only one that has found it's easier to stay active for the rest of the morning and afternoon of a long run without taking a shower. Obviously if I'm going to be going out in public I'll clean up, but if I'm going to be doing yard work, cleaning the house, etc etc...I'll change out of my running stuff but I've just noticed that I \"shut down\" less after a long run if I don't take a shower right away. Gross, maybe, but I'm more productive. \n\nNote: Be mindful of the exertion you do after a hard run and if you're quite fatigued you should likely not do a lot of bending over and picking up large objects an hour after a 3-hour run. \n\n**Take a bath**\n\nI'm a fan of the post-hard run Epsom salt bath. \n\nThe research goes back and forth on Epsom salt, some suggest it may just be the bath that is the beneficial part and the Epsom salt is of little importance. One thing to consider is that [hot water immersion](http://kylekranz.com/heat-adaptation/) has been shown to be beneficial, so perhaps that's part of why soaking in a warm tub after a run is beneficial. I don't know if Epsom salt helps or not, but I do know that a post-run soak feels good. \n\n**Compression Socks**\n\nMedical grade compression socks or full tights most likely do help improve your recovery. I will almost always wear a pair of compression socks for the rest of the day after a long run because frankly, they feel really good! Maybe they help, maybe they don't, but they sure are comfortable. \n\n**Full Meal**\n\nIf you ate or drank something small right after the run, it's not a huge huge deal when you eat a full meal, but you should certainly get one in within 1-2 hours of finishing the run. Honestly, it does not matter what you eat as long as it's \"real food\". \n\n**Nap**\n\nThis is certainly not for everyone depending on your plans for the rest of the day, but if you can manage, even taking a 30-minute nap it can help keep you functioning later in the day. Plus, sleep is one of the best things you can do for your recovery!\n\n**Stay Active**\n\nOne thing I try not to do on a long run day is sitting around too much. I find that just stiffens up the muscles! It's the weekend! Go for a casual walk, bike ride, or sup. Something that is not exercise but not sitting around will without a doubt make you feel a little better the next day. You've also likely heard that staying up and on your feet with some active recovery helps keep the blood flowing to help improve recovery.\n\n**Pre-Bed Casein**\n\nCasein is a very slow digesting protein, it makes up 80% of the protein in milk. Research has suggested this can be a smart thing to drink before the 8 hour fast we call sleeping at night.\n\nThe day of my harder / longer runs of the week I try to drink a glass of milk before bed. Again, the research is not conclusive if it's the timing+type of protein or the increase in the daily amount of protein that makes the difference, but research has shown it to be beneficial. If you're not into milk you can purchase casein protein powder. If you're not into animal protein I believe rice protein is slower than whey but faster than casein. Rice+pea protein mixtures cover all the vegan protein need bases.\n\n**Get a great night of sleep**\n\nSleep is one of the most effective recovery methods available. One reason to do a Sunday long run is that (I think) people are typically up later Saturday night then on a Sunday night, so you can go to bed earlier on Sunday and not miss out on any social activities. \n\n-----\n\n**Non-Morning Workouts**\n\nLet us chat about runs that are not done in the early morning, maybe you do a lunch or evening track workout.\n\nThe most important thing to know here is that when you see research or suggestions based on research talking about intra and post workout nutrition, those studies were almost always done on participants who ate nothing or little before the time trial or exertion test in the lab. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that if you've eaten one or two meals + snacks before a lunch or evening workout, you may not need to make such a huge deal of post-run nutrition. Of course, you should eat afterward, but don't stress about having a protein shake within 20 minutes of ending a run.\n\n**Easy Run**\n\nOne thing I want to add into the post-run routine for the easy run is to do strides. These are 30 second, 100 meter, one block, etc moderately hard accelerations with a recovery of walking back to where you started the stride. I typically recommend doing one per mile of the run for simplicity take and I recommend doing them after just about every easy run unless it's a super recovery focused run. Strides are meant to neurologically \"sharpen up\" your legs. They are short enough that easy runs are still easy with them. Strides are often looked at as ways to \"practice\" good running technique, like drills and plyometrics. Plus, it's fun to run fast ;) \n\n**Ice bathing?**\n\nThis is a controversial subject and I typically do not recommend them.\n\nWe have two considerations. The first is that ice bathing may hinder the adaptation you gain from a hard workout. Yes, you may feel better two days later, but if you gained less from the workout what was the point? You would have likely been better off not doing as hard of a workout. The second is that if you regularly feel the need to ice bath because you are so destroyed after a long run, you may have run too hard and/or too long. \n\nI do recommend ice bathing when the point of a workout is to stimulate the legs and not necessarily for adaptation. During a taper when you're doing higher quality but shorter workouts, feel free to take an ice bath. Or of course, if you're doing a race series and you have a 5k, half marathon, and marathon within three days you should certainly take a couple ice baths!\n\n-----\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) What is YOUR post run routine?\n\n2) Any questions/comments about anything related to this subject?\n",

Based on some recommendations here, I've started drinking chocolate milk right after a run and find it very helpful.  I generally run after work on weekdays and in the early/midafternoon on weekends, so I've almost always had a meal before the run.\n\nAlso, if it is especially hot/humid I'll chug a water with a Nuun or similar as soon as the run is finished.\n\nI am a fan of stretching, though maybe it is misguided?  My routine is to run 1 mile then do some dynamic stretches (leg swings, squats, high knees, butt kicks).  Then after any run of decent length, I do static stretches and foam roll.  The stretches I do are mostly yoga poses I've learned in classes, but I don't know the names.  They mostly stretch my calves and quads, which often feel right after a run.  Then I foam roll my calves, quads, and IT bands.  I hate every second of it but I do it anyway.\n\nIf I am feeling especially ambitious I'll do some planks right after I finish foam rolling.  Generally front planks, high planks, and one on each side, for 2 minutes each (8 minutes total).\n\nOne last thing worth mentioning:  I found a Saturday morning yoga class I really like, and one of my favorite things to do now is go on a moderate length tempo-ish run in the morning and then end the run at the yoga studio and do a full hour of stretching.",

I couldn't even look at food for hours after that one, just kept refilling Mello Yello and sucking it down hungrily.\n\nI was bonking the last 4-5 miles of my 20 miler Saturday. I had banana chips with me but found them hard to choke down and certainly didn't eat enough of them. I also drank way too much water, about 150oz. I was really sucking down the water toward the end but could tell it wasn't because I was thirsty and felt the water sloshing around in my belly. A friend of mine recommended Heed as it's mostly electrolytes with minimal sugar and I'm going to experiment with that on future 15+mile runs. My theory is my body's successfully burning fat as fuel but I've always had really salty sweat so I need to manage my electrolyte levels or I won't metabolize enough.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I felt robbed of energy overall those last few miles but my legs weren't particularly sore or more tired than the rest of me. No significant soreness or stiffness the next day. I used to make sure I took in as much potassium as possible in my MTB days (stinger honey shots) because I got muscle cramps on hill climbs but wondering if that's not as much of a concern now and I need to focus on salt intake.

    "body": "Thought I might as well documenting how my run with JnT 2.0 went, being the first program I've stuck with to the end.\n\n**Background**\n\n24/M/96kg/183cm. Used to swim competitively during my younger days but stopped around 17/18 to focus on studying. Been gymming since 20 years old but only the typical bro-splits and doing my own thing until around 2-3 years ago when I actually started deadlifting for the first time. Even then, the past 2-3 years have Been a bit wishy-washy with programs since I used to just auto-pilot. The COVID lockdown (gyms closed for 5 months) made me appreciate the gym more so I decided to make actual strength goals and tried sticking to a routine to try get my strength back in general.\n\nFor an example of my wishy-washyness, I was pretty much doing a mix of metallicapda's PPL (but 4-5 days instead of the actual 6), PHUL, coolcicada's PPL (again, 4-5 days where I'd just not do the 5th-6th day), with heavy modifications where I'd just drop exercises to make things easier for myself. Definitely was on autopilot pre-lockdown.\n\nDuring the lockdown I started long distance running, and was planning to do a half marathon though I'm running less now (will elaborate later in the post).\n\nI was gymming for 1.5 months (after coming back from lockdown) before I started this program.\n\n**Routine/Modifications**\n\nSo I ran the program as provided [here.](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html) The modification I made is that I added an optional day 5 (which just ended up being another day of training back) because I personally wanted to deadlift more. Also opted to do 2 T2 exercises and 3 T3 exercises as provided in the routine (though this can go to 3 T2 exercises and 4 T3 exercises).\n\nI wanted to keep my running habits consistent while running the program, though it turned out to be a bit too much (especially during the days where I'd run at night after running the routine) so I cut my running down to 4-10km per day for the weekend during the second block (week 7 - 12). I also started wearing a belt when deadlifting which helped an enormous amount, though would only do it one the set which was my calculated rep max at a specific week.\n\nThink it's better to read the program itself to get a feel of how it works rather than typing it up, though this was my typical routine:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|T1|T2A|T2b|T3A|T3B|T3C|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Deadlift|Lat Pulldowns|Cable Rows|Hammer Curls|V-Bar Curls|Weighted Ab Crunches|\n|Bench Press|Incline DB Press|OHP|Dips|Side DB Raises|Cable Crossovers|\n|Squats|Leg Press|Hip Thrusts|Leg Curls|Leg Extensions|Weighted Ab Crunches|\n|OHP|Bench Press|Incline Bench Press|Side DB Raises|Dips|Cable Crossovers|\n|Deadlifts|Weighted Pull-ups|Cable Rows|Hammer Curls|V-Bar Curls|Weighted Ab Crunches|\n\n**Diet**\n\nWon't lie I was pretty lax in terms of diet. All I cared about was getting in 160g of protein a day and didn't care about how I got it, even through KFC/Maccas, as long as I reached my protein intake (which explains the weight gain). Definitely could've cleaned up my eating habits for (potentially?) better results looking back.\n\nMornings typically consistent of a mix of 1 scoop of pea protein, 1 scoop of rice protein (bought a few too many bags after watching The Game Changers late last year...), 1 banana, almond milk and frozen berries. Also some coffee to wake me up for work.\n\nLunch would typically consist of pre-made meals from a food delivery company (Mymusclechef) and another coffee.\n\nTypically the above would get me to around 95-105g of protein per day, and I'd cover the remainder of the intake however I wanted.\n\n**Progress**\n\n||Starting 1RM|Pre-COVID lockdown 1RM|Finishing 1RM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Body weight|93kg/205lb||96kg/212lb|\n|Deadlift|150kg/330lb|165kg/364lb|210kg/452lb|\n|Bench|110kg/242lb|112.5kg/248lb|125kg/275lb|\n|Squat|110kg/242lb|120kg/265lb|140kg/308lb|\n|OHP|50kg/110lb|65kg/143lb|75kg/165lb|\n\nStarting 1RM for my OHPs were low mainly due to neglect after coming back from lockdown leading up to that point.\n\n**Thoughts/Comments**\n\n* As noted in the daily thread, very happy with the program, especially with my progress across the board as my primary goal was to gain back the strength I lost from COVID lockdown.\n* Very fun program with the right amount of volume for me personally - I really liked the concept with T1 exercises where you work towards the specified rep max of the week and the changes from that (e.g. starting from 10RM in week 1 and progressing downwards). Think that really helped in making gains to my T1 lifts.\n* This program eats up a lot of time honestly (especially doing the T3s) and I found myself spending more time in the gym than I had before.\n* In terms of progression, given the varied rep maxes per week I would pump my numbers into a rep max calculator and make incremental increases per week/two weeks. E.G. for week 1 I did 110kg deadlifts for 10RM, and when putting that in the strength calculator [here](https://strengthlevel.com/one-rep-max-calculator) it projects my 8RM to be 117.3kg. So by week 2 I would be aiming to doing 8RM at 120kg (as this incrementally increased the amount I lifted) and judged by feel as to whether I could lift more at any given week.\n* Around the second block I noticed I had some tightness in my lower back - no pain/strain/etc, just felt fairly tight which was mildly uncomfortable. However it all went away once I started stretching my glutes and hamstrings everyday (after reading somewhere that it may be the cause) which I thought was pretty interesting.\n* As noted previously, part of the reason why my deadlift shot up by so much was due to changing my grip for my rep max sets (alternate grip) + starting to wear a belt around week 10 or so.\n* I know my squat is absolute poverty, but a personal goal of mine was to clear 3 plates for 1 rep which I ended up doing in week 12 which was probably one of the best feelings I've had at the gym. Clearing 4 plates for deadlifts felt pretty good too.\n* I am not jacked because I ate like a fat shit, nor am I tanned because lockdown has made me reach all time pasty levels. I do stress that this is not at the fault of the program but just me personally lol.\n\n**What's Next?**\n\n* Find a program that will bring my squat up to par (might do Squatober as suggested in a daily thread)\n* Start running more again now that my strength is at a level I'm happy at.\n* Clean up my diet so I can cut down to a weight in the high 80kgs region.",

    "body": "***My skin type***: Oily\n\n***Climatic conditions while using the product:*** I live in Mumbai and have been using it for the past 5 weeks, so its been mostly humid\n\n***Routine at the time of using the product:*** I use a cleanser (Minimalist’s 2% SA Cleanser) + Toner (TonyMoly Ceramide Toner) + the Plum 5% Niacinamide Serum + Moisturiser (Isntree Acid Aqua Gel) with UV Doux sunscreen, both AM and PM.\n\n***Age***: mid-20’s\n\n***Usage timeline***: past 5 weeks\n\n***Ingredient list***: Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide (5%), Propanediol, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Cysteine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water, Ethoxydiglycol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Sodium PCA, Diglycerin, Urea, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Sorbitol, PCA, Allantoin, Lactic Acid, Methyl Gluceth-20, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Caprylyl Glycol, Cyclodextrin, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Gluconate\n\n***Texture/Consistency***: The serum has a *slightly* slimy consistency which ensures that you need to use less product. I use 2 drops each for each cheek and 1 for my forehead and thats more than enough. The serum absorbs fairly quickly so there’s no sticky feeling afterwards.\n\n***Fragrance***: no fragrance\n\n***Experience and thoughts in detail***: This is my first review on this sub and the only reason I was motivated to write it is because this is genuinely the first product I’ve used after years of skin care that *actually* feels like a Holy Grail product. I was slightly suspicious of Plum as a brand, thinking that its another Mamaearth type company which relies too heavily on marketing. But after reading some reviews in the comments here I decided to give it a shot after getting a good deal for it on Foxy.\n\nI bought the product to mainly combat 3 issues: large pores, dull skin, and closed comedones. Within just 2 uses, there was a noticeable difference in all three aspects. My pores were much less visible, my skin was brighter, and closed comedones also became less prominent (although the effect on them was more muted as compared to brightness and pores).\n\nSeeing these results, I started using the serum every single day in the AM, and it genuinely feels like the serum has been repairing my face because a lot of minor issues that plagued me felt like they were being slowly and gradually fixed. Razor bumps, CCs, fine lines, all were less visible, my skin felt smoother, it really felt like an all-round improvement.\n\nOne thing I specifically wanted to test about the product was how my skin looks on days that I DON’T use the product. I don’t want to use things that are only effective so long as you keep using them. I feel like a genuinely good product should be improving your skin organically and that those effects should not be dependent on you constantly using the product to maintain the look. So I took small breaks where I wouldn’t use the serum for 1 or 2 days. This may be too short of a break, but in those 1-2 days I didn’t find myself looking in the mirror and thinking “I wish I’d worn the serum today”. My skin looked just fine even without it, which made me even happier with the product.\n\nAfter using it almost every day for the past 5 weeks (the first week I went slightly slow), I’m still left with a little more than half of the bottle, so it should comfortably last me for another 5-7 weeks. I was lucky to get the whole bottle for 390, which seems like a great price in hindsight for a serum that has helped so drastically improve my skin.\n\n***Holy Grail/Will Re-Purchase/Will Not Repurchase/Holy Fail Status***: Any guesses? It’s absolutely an HG product for me, although I’m now considering trying Plum’s 10% Niacinamide serum next",

    "body": "This is a GF sourdough that I created a recipe for a couple of years back - which with a live and well starter makes a fantastic bread. It’s a bit demanding with a few steps - but hope you can agree it hopefully looks like it’s worth it ;-)\n\nWhether due to better shaping or the extra hour on the bench - the bread on the right had a better rise/oven spring - but the bread on the left still has slightly better air pockets/holes. But wonderful bread both of them.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n50g sourdough (100% teff)\n\n540g water (250g+ 90g + 200g)\n150g tapioca \n150g potato starch\n150g flour (50g sorghum, 50 millet, 50 teff)\n12g whey protein (you can sub for pea, soy or rice protein if you wish a vegan  alternative but you should then increase to 15g).\n1 tbs agave sirap \n\n10g potato fiber (called Potex in some markets - an alternative that I haven’t tried is to use 20-30gs of ground potato flakes) \n20g psyllium powder\n7g xantham\n\n2 tsps apple cider vinegar \n17gs salt\n\nSTEP 1\nMix all the flours and protein (total 462gs). Take out 75 grams for step 2.\nAdd in the sourdough, water (250gs) and mix by hand for at least 5 minutes. Cover and leave for two hours.\n\nSTEP 2\nAfter one hour, in a separate bowl take the “saved” 75gs of flour and add 90gs of water to autolyze (for this final hour - timed with the preferment of step 1).\n\nSTEP 3\nBoth the preferment and autolyze is now ready.\n\nSeparately mix the potato fiber, psyllium and xantham in your mixer with the remaining 200gs of water - creating a gel. \n\nAdd in the preferment, autolyze and agave and mix for 5 minutes and at some point add the 2 tsps of ACV. After 5 minutes add in the salt and let mix for another 5 minutes.\n\nLeave the dough to rest for 10 minutes before shaping:\n\nShape the bread - this is a reeeeally loose and sticky dough, but I do manage to shape it in two steps once poured out to a floured surface:\n\n1. ”Pinch & lift” around the sides of the dough - circularly inwards toward the middle (kind of like a flower). Gentle turn over  and let rest for 10 minutes.\n\n2. Turn over again so that the previous folds become visible. Now think of the dough as kind of a square/rectangular shape, first lift the right side and fold towards the middle, then the left side. Now the dough should be very rectangular. Then gently lift the top of the dough (furthest away from you) and roll it in towards you - much like a ”towel roll”. \n\n3. Place the dough in a banneton with the seam upwards and ”nip and tuck” the dough seam so that you close it well (don’t worry that you break the dough - it’ll work just fine). You can even try to close the two sides that look like a roll. Leave on the counter for 2-3 hours (I place my banneton in a sealable plastic bag).\n\nThroughout 1-3 you need to add a tiny bit of flour and it is a bit of a practice…… and a wide dough scraper, but the shaping is half the trick (as it is in usual non-GF baking as well).\n\nI spray my bread with a small water spray (atomizer) just before placing it in the DO (after scoring).\n\nBake at 230 degrees Celsius (445 F) in a dutch oven (I use the Challenger baking pan) for 35 minutes covered, and then uncovered for 35 minutes at 230 degrees. Dough will (should) be 99 degrees C / 210 F internal temp once done.\n\nIn a perfect world you can leave the bread in the oven for an additional 10-20 minutes (having turned off the oven to cool of) - this adds to further caramelization of the crust. Just leave the oven door open with a 5 cm gap to let out both heat and humidity (stick in an oven glove in the spring).\n\nAlso importantly - it’s all down to what starter you are using. In my experience Teff packs the biggest punch, why I have it both in my starter and also in the dry flour mix. \n\nGood luck",

We’re hoping it gives you more choice in flavours and also more choice based on your preference for ingredients - let me tell you more!\n\nv2.0 is in 4 new flavours!\n\n🍓 Strawberries & Cream  \n🍬 Salted Caramel  \n🍰 Cinnamon Swirl  \n☕ Iced Coffee Caramel - with 65mg caffeine per bottle\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jsd9hmhwex71.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=08f4af31fa0737d483addf8c99a4633b20fe06e8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the key differences between v1.0 and v2.0\n\n**Protein**\n\n* v2.0 has 22g of protein (compared to 20g in v1.0)\n* we’re also using hemp and pea protein (instead of brown rice and pea protein in v1.0)\n* Hemp protein is a really cool ingredient as it has an *even* lower impact than rice protein, it can grow quickly in lots of conditions and is naturally pest-resistant, so uses little or no pesticide\n\n**Natural vs artificial** \\- v2.0 is naturally sweetened with stevia and organic coconut sugar, whereas v1.0 uses sucralose. We know that some of you don’t like sucralose so, like with Black Edition, we have given you the choice between them\n\n**We are currently updating sites across our UK and EU stores, everything should be live later today! So if you go to the site and it isn’t there, please don’t write in saying it isn’t there** **📷**\n\nOnce we’re all set to go:\n\n* You will be able to buy either v1.0 or v2.0\n* We have a selection box of v2.0, so if you want to try all 4 flavours you can. This will be available in the UK and Germany only at the moment.\n* We will be putting single v2.0 RTDs in the ‘add more to your basket’ section of the checkout, as well as in the account area\n\nI will update this post with a link once we are finished!\n\nStay tuned any US Hueligans reading this, we’re coming for ya!",

It’s one thing during your final set to do partials for the extra burn but training till failure when you train 5-6 days a week is dumb. That’ll create lack of gains as your muscle fibers are being overworked. \n\nMain goal to keep muscle growth, general rule is each body part 2x a week, if you REALLY want growth for a specific muscle 3x a week but still cap at 6 days total for that one rest day. You’ve clearly got the diet part under control which is good, however add some red meat into your diet, it’s super food. But now it’s a matter of breaking old habits, and finding a split that ACTUALLY works. \n\nWhat you can also do is instead of doing the basic bro 3x8-10 sets, add an extra set in for just partials. I say this because this is how you avoid failure while still getting crazzzzzzy contraction in your squeeze at the top of the rep. Train smart, change shit up. We’re human, not robots. What works today may or might not work tomorrow. YouTube is a hell of a thing.\n\nAlso reminder: unless you’re taking gear with supporting supps for estrogen blocking, you cannot and I repeat you CANNOT control your fat gain.

    "body": "So I have been studying nutritional science for years as a hobby. It simply fascinates me how profound our experience in this life is impacted by what we consume.\n\nAs of late I've started to theorize about what a diet would look like that placed emphasis on mental/emotional well-being before any physical pay off (weight loss, muscle gain, et cetera...).\n\nObviously physical well-being and mental health are not exactly seperate entities but your hard pressed to find diets that value cognition over chiseled abs. So the question I pose is this...\n\nWhat foods, dietary habits, vitamins, supplements et cetera.. would you include in a theoretical diet that disregards the physique in the interest of cognition and emotional well-being.\n\nTo clarify, I'm not asking for a list of \"comfort foods\" here. A diet of chocolate and ice cream may make one feel better momentarily but no ones brain is going to work better on it. Nor is anyone going to yield a strong emotional state as a result.\n\nSo I'm curious. What would your theoretical \"brain\" diet look like.\n\nMine (thus far) looks like this:\n\n-Lower calorie intake (1400-1700)\n-Intermittent Fasting (one large meal a day)\n-Run/Jog about 30 miles a week or more.\n-No refined sugar, grains, dairy or meat (causes cravings impacting mental health)\n-No soy or chocolate (I am allergic/intolerant)\n-Minimal table salt (celtic sea salt is fine)\n-Lots of kale, spinach, collard and mustard greens. Next in line is a ton of broccoli, peppers and chili's and celery. Almonds, cashews, coconut milk/cream (unsweetened), seaweed and nutritional yeast. Hemp protein and brown rice protein (both plain unflavored).\n-drinking water and coffee only\n-spicing everything with lots of black pepper, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon, dill, cardamon, chili pepper, basil, savory, oregeno, and sage. also using vinegar for flavor.\n-Supplement with Omega 3 (fish oil), DHEA, Baccopa (optional not constant), Glycine, Glutamine (optional not constant), b-vitamins (mostly 6, 12 and 1) and DLPA.\n\nBear in mind this is MY theoretical \"brain\" diet. I don't suggest this for anyone else, nor do I believe this to be the most nutritionally sound plan for physical well-being. With that said, I have lived on this for about 2 months now and feel freakin' fantastic. No cravings for anything (after the initial week or so after giving up dairy and meat) not emotional instability (i used to be quite moody and dealt with moderate bouts of depression I linked to dairy and certain meats) can focus and work longer hours, never feel physicall or mentally drained, and as a bonus I've lost weight.",

As you run into low percentages of body fat (which you will, if you restrict calories the way you do), that might lead to the hormone caused mental problems I mentioned earlier.\n\nAnd, if not meat, I would at least add in some eggs: Choline, a variety of fatty acids, and animal protein from a source that is clean enough to enable embryonal development might be good things to have as a supplement to what you are already doing.",

There are many theories that suggest that building some muscle will make you smarter too. Restricting calories for at least a couple of days a week still might be a good idea, regardless of your targets. Refined sugars are fine if you don't abuse them. Salt is fine unless you eat tons of it. Grains are not all equal... I've cut out wheat from my diet but stuff like brown and/or parboiled rice are great. I don't think that giving up meat completely will make your brain any better. We're naturally omnivorous and you might have a hard time compensating for all the good stuff in meat if you give it up. You're definitely better off eating fish than supplementing with Omega3s, as long as you don't go too high up the food chain where mercury becomes an issue. I'd also add grape seed extract (or eat grapes with seeds in them if you can find them and chew them up properly - I can't find them at all at my local stores). It's one of those supplements that look really promising and don't seem to show any potential harm so I take it. [Check out ergo-log.com on this supplement](http://www.ergo-log.com/gse.html).",

    "body": "I was recently asked (In the TrueProtein thread) if I would propose custom supplements depending on goals. I decided to make a quick post about it.\n\nAside from the Meal Replacement, all of these were formulated with Pre-workout and Intra-workout in mind. You can just eat good food after the workout.\n\nBasically, these ingredients can be formulated through [this](http://www.truenutrition.com/p-1126-custom-mix.aspx) link:\n\n**Bodybuilding:**\n\n-\tHydrolyzed Whey Protein Supergrade (20%)\n-\tSoy Protein Isolate non-GMO (20%)\n-\tFructose (10%)\n-\tDextrose (20%)\n-\tL-Leucine by the Pound (10%)\n-\tAcetyl-L-Carnitine by the Pound (5%)\n-\tCreapure by the Pound (5%)\n-\tCitrulline Malate by the Pound (10%)\n\n$10.26 per pound\n\nAs many scoops as desired before and during the workout, as long as it doesn’t impair actual workout performance. Basically just getting substrate into your body and letting the muscle contractions do the rest.\n\nA note on Soy protein Isolate. The isolate form is so processed and detract from foods that it really isn’t soy anymore, it’s just a solution of amino acids. (This is why it is used as a control in most scientific research on different protein types; there is nothing fancy about Isolate aside from being a solution of amino acids). I put it in for economy and the fact that all I really wanted was extra amino acids (so why spring for more expensive amino acids?), but if you want you may replace it with more Hydrolyzed Whey Protein SuperGrade or Whey Protein concentrate.\n\n**Powerlifting:**\n\n-\tHydrolyzed Whey Protein Supergrade (30%)\n-\tAmylocel (Wazy Maize Starch) (20%)\n-\tFructose (10%)\n-\tDextrose (15%)\n-\tAcetyl-L-Carnitine by the Pound (5%)\n-\tCreapure by the Pound (10%)\n-\tCitrulline Malate by the Pound (10%)\n\n$10.90 per pound\n\n1-2 scoops should suffice. I mainly just chose this mix with neural efficacy in mind and not vomiting during a 1RM attempt (as, if you look at the protein and carb choices, they all pass the stomach fairly quickly)\n\n**Muscular Endurance (Crossfit, etc.)**\n\n-\tCalcium Caseinate (20%)\n-\tHydrolyzed Casein (10%)\n-\tAmylocel (Waxy Maize Starch) (20%)\n-\tFructose (10%)\n-\tMaltodextrin (10%)\n-\tAcetyl-L-Carnitine (5%)\n-\tCreapure (5%)\n-\tCitrulline Malate (20%)\n\n$14.69 per pound, but thankfully only 1 scoop is really needed for an hour or so.\n\nSame idea as powerlifting in order to make it more stomach-happy, but then gave a focus to fuelling the body for a longer period of time. So essentially slow intestinal release and fast gastric digestion (casein and WMS). Added in a buttload of Citrulline Malate for the higher volume of work done.\n\nIt might be good to buy Beta-Alanine on its own, since it cannot be added in custom mix.\n\n**Meal Replacement:**\n\n-\tRice Protein concentrate non-GMO (20%)\n-\tGemma Protein Pea isolate non-GMO (20%)\n-\tWhey protein concentrate (20%)\n-\tTaurine by the pound (5%)\n-\tAcetyl-L-Carnitine by the pound (5%)\n-\tL-Glutamine by the pound (10%)\n-\tPsyllium seed husk fiber (10%)\n-\tMedium Chain Triglyceride powder (10%)\n\n$8.35 per pound\n\nFormulated with health and economy  in mind. This shake is most likely going to be nice and thick after you prepare it, so be forewarned (Gemma Pea Protein and Psyllium)\n\n**Flavoring Agents, Packaging, and other additives**\n\nPackaging is either a large-ass thick plastic bag or a jug. Both are minimally labelled but the jug is priced more but, in my opinion, only serves the purpose of getting less ‘WTF is that?’ stares from your family than a big bag of protein would.\n\nIf you have money to burn, spring for the CEC / PEC / Vitamin / electrolyte mix, but it costs an extra $2.70 per pound. At minimum I would add the Electrolyte mix, and possibly Protein Enzyme Complex / Electrolytes if you want to aid stomach digestion even further (as the workout protocols are designed to be pre/intra workout stuff anyways).\n\nChoose your artificial sweetener and flavouring of choice. The only thing to note here is that although all flavours (that I have tasted) are good, the ones that are naturally fatty in nature (such as peanut butter, chocolate, or cheesecake) will taste ‘off’ if not paired with dietary fats. Having these during a workout with no dietary fats will be sort of a weird taste experience, and thus I would recommend something more berry-like for workouts. \n\n*Discount Code*\n\nFor an extra 5% off, use the code KSF812 on your checkout. It is a personal code that does potentially benefit me (I explained it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/hwe5i/i_found_a_site_that_will_let_you_make_a_custom/c1yxguv)) so use it if you wish.\n\n**Edit**\n\nSince this thread is still alive to some. A while ago there was notification that some credit card numbers were leaked from TrueProtein. They seem to, for the most part, have eliminated the thread. However, this also happened in the past and they also claimed to have eliminated the threat this time.\n\nI do not know the details of what happened, nor whether it will happen in the future (I doubt). That being said, it may be advisable to use PayPal or a Virtual Credit Card. Not many numbers were taken when you look at the overall amount of people who buy from TrueProtein, but this is still something you don't want to risk.\n\n**Double Edit** (07/09/11)\n\nFor the past two months there have been no reported credit card number losses from ordering from TrueProtein to my knowledge.\n\n**Triple Edit** (07/11/11)\n\nFlavour Log, for those wondering and by yours truly:\n\n- Key Lime Pie is godly for workouts; not too sour and does taste like limes (works with both sugared drinks and non-sugared drinks) Citrus Lime-ade is a bit tangier but still great.\n\n- Dutch chocolate fudge is very chocolately, and works best with both sugars and fats (meal replacements); the other chocolates (banana, orange, mint) are all good, but the chocolate mint makes a great morning wake-up shooter (face really feels it)\n\n- Strawberry Banana and Strawberry Cheesecake both taste mostly like strawberries, Orange Creamsicle does taste like an orange creamsicle but a diluted one if not paired with sugars\n\n- Chocolate chip cookie dough, Cookies n' Cream, and Creamy Peanut butter are excellent to overcome the milky taste of bulk casein and whey protein (unflavored and unsweetened protein)",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI first want to clarify, so as to not give false hope, that I NEVER had chronic MCAS prior to my first issues with it. I believe what I had was acute. It began in October 2023 after I, out of nowhere, had a reaction to a medical cream. I have never had allergies or dealt with anything like this. After this happened, I began to react to everything, from food to cosmetics to things in the environment. I stopped being able to eat most things. At my worst, I did not eat (yes, you read correctly) for one month and then three weeks due to reactions and severity of them. It was terrible. I always loved dairy; I could no longer have it. I liked alcohol; I could no longer have it. I wore make-up; I could no longer wear it. By October 2024, I was suffering from various deficiencies and was malnourished. I had been this way for months, but it was worse. I had extreme fatigue. I was deficient in B vitamins, calcium, iron, vitamin d, zinc, magnesium and VERY much lacked protein. I did not get to eat more protein until January, after I began correcting other deficiencies in early October. I took every vitamin and mineral I could think of, especially B vitamin, my first priority. I then began calcium vitamins. I had read for some time how vitamin c and vitamin d inhibited mast cells, and was deficient in vitamin d anyway. I began vitamin c and d and they very quickly began to help. The more I took, the better I became, especially VITAMIN C. Vitamin c has SAVED me. I have taken it daily (in gummies) since October and I am now as normal as I ever was. I can eat all the things I used to, wear all the make-up I want, use any soap, clean with bleach, drink alcohol, eat tons, exercise, everything! I drink whatever alcohol I want, including wine. I was never a fan of red, so I drink white. Recently I have been having it most nights with NO problems, not even minor, NOTHING. I eat wheat, dairy, soy, and so on. I am eating cheese every day, large amounts. I eat pizza and pasta. I drink milk and have eaten yogurt again. I wear perfume and use body lotions, any kind. My partner recently painted the house and I can barely smell the paint, and certainly have NOT reacted to it.\n\nI don't know if vitamin c or any supplements are going to help people with chronic MCAS, although I would think vitamin c and d would as they are mast cell inhibitors! Vitamin c really does inhibit mast cells. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I gradually added more and more to my diet, more and more \"normal\" things back to my life, and now I am back to the way I was before my reaction to the medical cream I used in October 2023, when my life changed dramatically and horribly. I go running again and cycle several times a week. I eat all the dairy I want. I am so happy.\n\n\nI feel the nervous system plays an enormous role in reactions too. My nervous system has healed. I can feel it. It was shot after I reacted to this cream back in October 2023, completely shot. It now feels healed and normal. The fewer reactions you have, and longer you can make it last for, the greater your chances are at getting better. The last real reaction I had was early July last year. I was VERY disciplined and did EVERYTHING I could to avoid more reactions, giving my nervous system and mast cells the time to heal, to calm down. October is when I began the supplements. Late December is when I began drinking alcohol again, and finally (it took time due to some apprehension - I didn't want to ruin things after getting better), March is when I began eating dairy again. After the first few times, I was eating it all the time, as I knew I was not going to react. I had the confidence.\n\nI am vegetarian, so don't touch meat anyway. I was greatly missing protein. I had been having brown rice protein from December to March, but it was nothing like dairy, which I now consume all the time again, without even a slight symptom. Nothing.\n\nMy advice to anyone with MCAS, chronic or acute, is to try to calm your nervous system and your mast cells for at least three months, meaning no reactions, and then gradually start to expand your diet. Keep your nervous system calm and TAKE daily vitamin c!\n\nKind regards!",

        "body": "Happy you healed!! I will say that your advice to calm the nervous usually will never be enough. It’s like a doctor saying anxiety is the issue or meditate and you’ll get better. Although it can and may help calm you down a little or help you in the long run figure out your root cause because you are calm it’s very important figuring out root cause. My root cause is vitamin b3 deffienciey because of MTHFR gene mutation and mold as a trigger. It HAS to be in the form of niacinamide or it won’t do anything though. I plan on making a post eventually about it. I do as well plan on supplementing with vitamin c specifically buffered vitamin c. Gotta be careful what vitamin c you get though cause a lot of supplements are synthetic version and I’d imagine will make people with severe MCAS flare up",

I don't know if this percentage is correct.  However, the potential for spontaneous improvement is there.\n\nThe benefit from vitamin C at the end might have been just been scurvy. \n\nMaybe you developed a hypersensitivity illness like MCAS or MCS, then that illness led to not eating, which led to malnutrition, which led to scurvy. At the same time of spontaneously improved you were taking vitamin C, which fixed the scurvy.\n\nI don't think that anyone should force themselves into scurvy and then back out hoping to go through spontaneous improvement.  But maybe people should remember this story incase someone describes the same thing again.",

        "body": "I am working on getting better after having been really sick for a while. I can’t point to just one thing that got to the point where every food resulted in uncontrolled coughing, sinus issues, fatigue… Before that, I was getting one UTI after another, talking antibiotics but none of the ones we are not supposed to have. During and in between UTIs, I was having all kinds of related symptoms, inflammation, IC, and other discomfort. Somewhere, in between everything else, I lost my interest in chocolate. A square of I’m ported dark chocolate was a lifelong vice, always with a big glass of ice cold milk, every day, a few times a day. Then, one day, I got no satisfaction from it. I don’t drink alcohol, or coffee, and I don’t smoke, but I imagine it would have been the same being hooked on one of those things and suddenly getting none of the expected results all of a sudden. The, the cough started again. I had had it before. It had been bad, and lasted a long time, but I had alway thought it was me catching colds and getting them worse and longer that other people. This time was far worse. Every single thing I ate sent me into terrible coughing fits, along with brain fog, tummy pain, diarrhea… So would stop eating, but then the post nasal drip would fill me up and the coughing would be out of control again. I want to an allergist who told be to double my antihistamines. I doubled the, then tripled them, just to be able to lay still without coughing for a while. I have been taking Benadryl like tic tacs. I time eating around when I will need to take the antihistamines anyway. I was trying to do an elimination diet of sorts. Eating low histamine foods I liked, steamed asparagus and steamed broccoli. I had given up dairy and sugar, a behavioral response to my body punishing me so badly for those things. I have never liked most breads. No yeast breads. I can relate my not liking them directly to my mast cell issues because I could only tolerate a little of the breads I normally eat during this time. There is a bakery nearby that makes a rye bread with no yeast once a week and I have been eating a lot of that with butter and getting away with it more than most things. Rice cakes with butter and a little honey… as long as I am taking all the antihistamines. I am being able to eat freshly the dark meat of baked chicken. I freeze what I don’t eat and defrost it in the microwave another day, because I have trouble with leftovers and learned they become high in histamines if they haven’t been frozen right away. I worked really hard to make a low histamines desert like bread with no yeast, but zucchini, apple sauce, egg, roasted pecans, eggs… woke up to the flushing being back, along with the bags under my eyes returning. It is all so hit and miss and frustrating. I have spent a fortune on supplements. All the things to help my immune system, quercetin at the top of the list. DAO. So many others. What started this? I was dealing with the physically trauma by a bad fall a few years ago, that led to a frozen shoulder, among other things. I still have limited mobility in shoulder and neck. I can no longer use my walker for long because of those injuries. I am so much weaker from being so much weaker. I did some PT but it often made things worse. The PT who had gotten to know me and what my limitations were moved out of the area. I want to go back to pool therapy because I know I need to get stronger. I am so weak, getting there and back again, I would really need help with. By there, I mean the YMCA. They have a therapy pool and I was taught pool exercises at by a PT when there was a PT pool in the area, covered by my insurance. I am so weak from writing this, I have to stop. Just took my temp, and it is up again. I have been running low grade temps, up and down a lot this past week. Time for a nap now. Still, this is better than I was a week ago.",

Hold under the tongue for 2 min to help it absorb 1/2 way through your meal or snack: your mast cells have cbd receptors in them & it calms them down, and no, it doesn't show up on a drug test ~ it's cbd without the thc}, plus a Dr from Canada who treats \"Pots\" patients uses 1000mg Magnesium Glycinate very successfully because it calms the mast cells & nervous system, I also take 2 doses a day of quercitin & fexofenadine, 1 dose of Famotadine and some other nervous system callers. I was pretty much bed bound for about 6 months, every time I got up my pulse would shoot into the 150's & I felt like fainting & did a couple times. Heart palpitations, heat waves that were unbelievable {but thanks to those little powerful fans you can plug into your phone I was relieved pretty quickly} I slept with a gallon sized silicone zip lock bag of solid ice every night. I lost my appetite, obviously, and lost 90 lbs. My hands & finger tips would burn if I held something for too long {allergic reaction} I took hydroxyzine 2x/day for the extreme itching. Just the smell of cooking beef would send me over the edge. I had unbelievable motion sickness everytime i moved, and was woke up out of a sound sleep regularly barfing in bed. I was always nauseous. {Thank you to the \"all natural essential oil motion sickness patches\" you put behind your ears! Godsend! } My nutrition was down the drain as well like many of you, so I finally got tired of feeling like I was dying everyday & bought some Hemp protein powder online without the harmful other ingredients {30 servings for $20}, I mix it into 2 cups of unsweetened coconut milk with a tbsp of golden monkefruit & a tiny bit of stevia \"extract\" powder. I also add 3 or 4 drops of an alcohol free Cake Batter extract & 1/2 a tsp of cinnamon {tastes just like cinnamon toast crunch cereal! } or I'll also add 4~5 drops of alcohol free Key Lime {tastes just like froot loops! }. I drink this 2~3x/day. I take lots of supplements {including 3000mg Vit c, 50,000 Vit D 3x/week} a great bioactive Vit B complex, an extra 7,000 Vit B12 {methylcobalomin only},  3g of BCAA's 2~3x/day {I combine most of these into my drinks for the day that I make up with homemade flavored Electrolytes because my tummy really can't handle too much food}. I might have a few mixed berries if I can handle it 2~3x/week. I made it out of the bed finally and was wheel chair bound for about 4 months, and now I've graduated to a \"hurrycane\". As long as I go 🐌 slow, all this calms down my system & I can slowly do things around the house {I pick 3 things to try to accomplish & write them down the night before}. I rest quit often sitting or laying on the 2 biggest, softest dog pillows I have ever seen in my life because my skin is  extremely sensitive {nerves} with MCAS & I've lost so much weight it hurts to even lay on the bed without them. I have hope for my future a little more now that I'm not bed bound, so I'll take that as a win!",

[Picture of Paca Powder.](https://i.imgur.com/tFbVrbi.jpg)\n\nThe idea is to offer a better option for the Nordic countries with faster shipping to Sweden, Finland, Norway (hope to come up with a solution for the customs fees soon) and the Baltics. I'd also like to offer a more localised product and service in the future.\n\n**Product**\n\nPaca is based on a recipe of oat flour, maltodextrin, soy flour, pea protein, rice protein, sunflower oil, a vitamin and mineral blend, glucose syrup, natural vanilla flavouring, sodium carbonate, xanthan gum (thickener), silica (anticoagulant), modified starch, rosemary extract (antioxidant) and sucralose (sweetener).  Full ingredients list can be found [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0014/0918/7898/files/Paca_Nutritional_Information.pdf) and you can read more [here](https://pacafood.com/products/paca-powder). \n\nPaca is also listed on [Blendrunner](https://blendrunner.com) if you want to compare macros to other 'lents.\n\nA bag is 1962 kcal/498g, so three larger meals. Paca is completely 🌱 vegan, quite sweet and has a smooth texture. The first version comes in vanilla flavour but I'm working on getting several new flavours out. 🍎🍓🍪\n\n**Produced in The Netherlands, shipped out of Sweden**\n\nI work together with an established production company and use their services and facilities in The Netherlands to produce the powder. I ship the product out of Sweden to most of EU for free and the rest of the world with paid shipping. 🚛\n\nSince launching in April I shipped about 40 orders to customers in 12 countries around Europe. Some Redditors already posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/8fbhs8/my_review_of_paca_powder/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/8cxk4w/what_shall_i_eat_today/). \n\nThanks /u/Bimchi, /u/MamaGrande and everyone else who ordered so far. :-)\n\n**Feedback**\n\nPlease let me know any questions or feedback you might have about the product or the website. I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks! Alexander (@choperius)\n\n**Link to website:** https://pacafood.com",

So you get to choose from [Super Fuel Strawberry](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fuel/?flavor=strawberry), [Athlete Fuel Strawberry](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/athlete-fuel/?flavor=strawberry), and of course [Milk Fuel Strawberry](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/milk-fuel/?flavor=strawberry&size=20) (it's really good). :) For all you ketoers out there, [Keto Fuel Chocolate](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/?flavor=chocolate) is still a favorite.  \n>  \n>The only drawback with freeze-dried strawberry powder is that it's *really* expensive. As in, it becomes the single most expensive ingredient in any product we add it to, even though we're just using it for flavoring. :p So at our current subscription prices, we would actually *lose* money selling strawberry, and at our one-off prices, we barely break even.  \n>  \n>So naturally, we'll start by selling it at our one-off price, no subscriptions allowed. This is a test run, and we'll see what you all think. If you just can't get enough, and you'd even pay a little more just to have it as a regular option, let us know! Vote with your dollars and your comments. ;)  \n>  \n>And no, if we have to use a \"natural strawberry flavor\" (fake) we won't do it at all. Strawberry in particular is a really difficult flavor to synthesize well. It just doesn't compare to the real thing. **And we need to have the real thing.** That's how we do it.  \n>  \n>Oh, and for those of you with strawberry allergies, we are producing our strawberry batches separately to avoid cross-contamination, so you should be good with your usual flavors. ;)  \n>  \n>In other news, we've heard your overwhelming response in favor of **making scoops an optional add-in to the shipping box**, instead of including them automatically with every bag - thanks to everyone who filled out the survey! :D We'll get to work on switching over our systems and processes to make that happen.  \n>  \n>At the same time, we also hear that most of you don't need the small bags of Milk Fuel, while some of you really love [Milk Fuel Original](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/milk-fuel/?flavor=original&size=40) and would be heartbroken to see it go. So we're just going to **stop producing the small Milk Fuel** for now, while continuing to produce Original (and the other flavors) in the larger size. If you really want the small, now is the time to stock up! ;) And if you want to adjust the timing of your subscription to account for the larger size, just send us an email with the details and we'll get that set up for you.  \n>  \n>We'll revisit the fate of Milk Fuel Original later on, so please don't hesitate to send us your feedback on it too! In the meantime, please enjoy Strawberry and let us know what you think! :D We're so excited to hear how it goes for you! :)  \n>  \n>Thanks everyone!  \n>  \n>Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)\n\n---\n\nPlease try a sample or a bag and let me know what you think here in the comments! :d\n\nThank you! :D",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

    "body": "Hello, everyone!\n\nI’m about 5 months into my fitness journey and have been pretty consistent, hitting the gym 4x a week. My goal is to pack on muscle and aim for body recomposition. However, I’ve noticed my progress slowing down, and I’m 100% sure it’s because I’m struggling to hit my protein targets.\n\nHere’s the issue: I get full way too fast. I can’t even make it through a whole protein shake without tapping out, let alone big meals like dinner. On top of that:\n\t•\tI’m on ADHD medication, which suppresses my appetite.\n\t•\tI work night shifts, so my eating schedule is already tricky.\n\t•\tMy appetite fluctuates wildly depending on my menstrual cycle.\n\nAnd the protein shake struggle: I can’t stomach most protein shakes because artificial sweeteners and dairy mess with my gut (sensitive stomach problems!). I’ve tried unflavoured whey, and it’s slightly better, but still getting the stomach issues. It’s not full-on lactose intolerance, but something in dairy products—like whey, casein, and even Greek yogurt—just doesn’t sit well with me. I’ve tried alternatives like pea and brown rice protein, but the brands I’ve tried so far require me to consume much more volume to hit my protein goals, which makes it even harder.\n\nSo, my question is: Do any of you ladies with similar struggles have tips on overcoming this?\n\nI’d love to hear how you manage hitting your protein goals with similar challenges (sensitive stomachs, suppressed appetite, night shifts, etc.). Any advice, specific brands, or creative strategies would be super helpful!\n\nThank you in advance!",

    "body": "This might be  a little too science-nerdy, but I thought some people here might like this info.  Rosa Labs just put out a new page on the [protein in Soylent 1.5](https://faq.soylent.com/hc/en-us/articles/203709479-Protein) and it thankfully includes the amino acid composition.\n\nI won't go into too much detail about protein quality and PDCAAS values, but you can find more information on Wiki [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Digestibility_Corrected_Amino_Acid_Score).  Essentially, the PDCAAS is the current best system for determining how well a protein source stacks up against the needs of a person.  Now, there are limitations to this scoring system, but like I said, it's the best system that has been developed so far.\n\nTo determine a PDCAAS score, the quantity of essential amino acids in a given amount of protein is measured and compared with the amino acid requirements of a growing human.  Then, the value is adjusted for digestibility.  Any score above 100 is rounded down, since 100 is considered a 'perfect' score for meeting human protein needs.\n\nUsing the amino acid information on the Soylent site, I calculated the following amino acid amounts:\n\n | Ideal (mg/g) | Soylent 1.5 (mg/g)\n---|---|---\nIsoleucine | 28 | 55\nLeucine | 66 | 76\nLysine | 58 | **50**\nThreonine | 34 | 45\nTryptophan | 11 | 15\nValine | 35 | 58\nMethionine+Cysteine | 25 | 47\nPhenylalanine+Tyrosine | 63 | 83\n\nNow, all quantities are above the human requirement except for lysine.  This is likely due to the fact that lysine is a limited amino acid in grains, and the primary source of protein in Soylent 1.5 is rice protein.\n\nNow, the other variable in this equation is harder to estimate, and that is the digestibility score.  Honestly, I can't find any useful references for the digestibility of rice protein, but the [original published PCDAAS paper](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/130/7/1865S/T2.expansion.html) lists another grain (wheat) at 91%.  I believe this is a safe value to use.  Now, with lysine as the limiting amino acid, and assuming a 91% digestibility, we end up with a PDCAAS of (50/58) * .91, or **78.5 out of 100**.  If we aim high and assume a 95% digestibility, the score is 81.9 out of 100.\n\nNow, Soylent 1.5 has 80 grams of protein per 2000 calorie serving.  Using a 91% digestibility (and therefore a PDCAAS of 78.5), this indicates that for every 2000 calorie daily serving of Soylent 1.5, you are getting .785*80g=62.8 grams of 'complete/ideal' protein, with the other 17.2 grams being lysine-deficient.\n\n---\n\nSo, TL;DR?  Well, nothing earth shattering I suppose, but if your entire diet is Soylent 1.5, just realize that you might only be getting 62.8 grams of complete protein per day.  Personally, my goals are weight loss and satiety, so I supplement my Soylent with [rice protein](http://smile.amazon.com/Nutribiotic-Organic-Protein-Vanilla-Pound/dp/B0033T8GR4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1433278725&sr=8-2&keywords=nutribiotic+rice), [lysine powder](http://smile.amazon.com/Source-Naturals-L-Lysine-Powder-3-53/dp/B0019LXGXM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1433278767&sr=8-3&keywords=lysine+powder), and [fiber](http://smile.amazon.com/Yerba-Prima-Psyllium-Powder-Ounce/dp/B00012NG1W/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1433278790&sr=8-3&keywords=yerba+psyllium), but it's up to you to determine your specific course of action.\n\nThanks for reading!",

    "body": "Hey everyone, axcho of [Super Body Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/) (and previously, [Custom Body Fuel](http://custombodyfuel.com/blog/)) here. :)\n\nI just sent out [a new email](https://superbodyfuel.com/blog/may-2020-update/) with a bunch of recipe updates (including some placeholder vitamins until we get our custom vitamin mix back in stock, my bad) and a bit of quarantine commentary. Also, hopefully the final chapter in the [DHA debacle](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/es8aan/fishy_smell_from_dha_powder_should_we_use_a_lower/). :d\n\n>Hi everyone,  \n>  \n>Hope you're all hanging in there okay! [We're still here](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/), we're all healthy (thankfully!) and we have just caught up with our pandemic backlog.  \n>  \n>To those of you out in the world, working in essential businesses, *thank you*. To those of you stuck at home - *or away from home* \\- I feel you. If you're looking for inspiration in the midst of quarantine right now, I highly recommend this little video: [Lockdown Productivity: Spaceship You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck). I hope you find it as helpful a reminder as I have!  \n>  \n>Staying healthy, physically and mentally, can be *a lot harder* than you might expect when you're stuck in a (metaphorical) spaceship apart from the usual structures of society. If you can take this as an opportunity to come back better than you left, awesome. But no pressure - **do what you can.** That's what I'm trying to do.  \n>  \n>Anyway, we've got a lot of updates:\n> \n> * **Super Micros:** out of stock for a few weeks!\n> * [NATURELO](https://naturelo.com/product/one-daily-multivitamin-for-women/): temporary placeholder vitamins.\n> * **10% DHA:** more stable and less smelly.\n> * [Actualize](https://goactualize.com/): free samples for your review!\n>  \n>And a few recipe tweaks coming soon:\n>\n> * **Sodium Citrate added:** to reduce saltiness.\n> * Inositol halved: to prevent digestive issues.\n> * **Strawberry:** now with 20% more flavor!\n> \n>So, the main thing is that *we ran out of our custom vitamin mix* (oops), and we're using a different vitamin as a placeholder until we get our resupply shipment. I'm really sorry about this - we had a miscalculation and I wasn't paying close enough attention to the amount of actual product on our warehouse shelves... :/ So I found a multivitamin, from [NATURELO](https://naturelo.com/product/one-daily-multivitamin-for-women/), with similarly high-quality ingredients (methylated B vitamins, chelated minerals, and all that) that's also vegan, and we've started using that in the meantime.  \n>  \n>You might not notice a difference, but that's what's going on. And as a result, we're unfortunately out of [Super Micros](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-micros/) and unable to resume shipping them until we get our resupply. :( My apologies.  \n>  \n>**We should be back to normal, vitamin-wise, in a few weeks.**  \n>  \n>In a (hopefully) satisfying conclusion to the seaweed-smell saga, we've switched to another algae-based DHA powder with a lower concentration of oil (10% instead of 18%) relative to the carrier powder, that should be more stable and less likely to smell. We're still targeting the same amount of oil, over 500mg vegan long-chain omega-3 fats per day, including 400mg DHA. Hope you like it! :)  \n>  \n>**Here's a new thing.** We're getting ready to launch our dairy-based ketogenic \"just add water\" partner product, **Actualize**:  \n>  \n>https://goactualize.com/  \n>  \n>If you would like a free sample of Actualize included in your next Super Body Fuel order, **we are doing a giveaway** \\- free samples in exchange for you posting an honest review on reddit ([r/soylent](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/) or any relevant subreddit that you frequent)! :D  \n>  \n>If you're interested, **just reply to this email with the flavor you want** (vanilla or chocolate, or both) and which subreddit you plan to post your review. If there's another place outside of reddit where you'd rather post a review, just let us know! :)  \n>  \n>*And if you've already tried your sample, consider this a friendly reminder to please post your review on reddit when you get a chance. ;p*  \n>  \n>Oh, in case you're wondering, we *are* still working on a rebrand for Super Body Fuel - it's just been delayed a few months by all the interesting times this year. :d Stay tuned.  \n>  \n>**Coming soon are a couple minor recipe adjustments.** First of all, based on updated nutrition data on our latest rice protein, we've increased the amount of salt to compensate for lower sodium levels than before, but that's... made things a little *too* salty. So we'll be substituting a bit of Sodium Citrate for some of that extra salt, which is a less-salty sodium source. Also, it's supposed to be absorbed more readily than your usual Sodium *Chloride* and it maybe even helps reduce the perception of bitterness a bit, which is neat.  \n>  \n>And at this point we've had a *few* people report digestive issues with the DHA and Myo-Inositol update this year, and just in case that's due to the Inositol, we'll be reducing the amount from 2g to 1g per day. A typical diet naturally includes 1-2g of Inositol anyway (less on a low-carb diet) but this may help those of you who don't tolerate it as well. Let us know what you think.  \n>  \n>Ooh, also, *based on feedback that our strawberry flavor isn’t strong enough*, **we’re bumping up the amount of freeze-dried strawberry powder by 20%!** It looks like this may actually cause us to lose money on [Milk Fuel](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/milk-fuel/), oops, so let us know what you think. :o I wish I were exaggerating, but there will be literally $15 worth of strawberries in each Milk Fuel Strawberry bag with this change - and that's the wholesale price. Worth it or not? :p  \n>  \n>At the same time, I suspect that the alkaline Potassium Bicarbonate in the mix is reacting with the acidic strawberries to mute the flavor and reduce the bright pink color as it dissolves, which is definitely not awesome. So we'll also be experimenting with using only Dipotassium Phosphate instead, just for the strawberry flavors.  \n>  \n>Okay, long update, I know. :d **Thank you for sticking with us.** Just keep doing your best, and we'll do the same! :)  \n>  \n>Thanks, and take care.  \n>  \n>Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)\n\nFeedback welcome. Oh, and the *\"free Actualize samples with a Super Body Fuel order\"* thing is open to anyone who wants to try it - just let me know in a comment or email! :)",

    "body": "\"Hulk Bread\"\n\nEasy to make, and I hope it's something you like too.\n\nEat after a long gym session, or in the morning, or whenever.  \n\nI eat mine cold, because it's hot here in my area.\n\nRecipe makes about 1 1/2 loaf. \n\nRecipe:\n\n1 1/2 cups all purpose flour. \n\n*You can try whole wheat flour, however, it's already pretty dense, so it might need more flavor, and water, or butter to help it become more fluffy.*\n\n1/2 cups protein oat flour. \n\n*I use Bob's Protein Oats, and then just simply grind them up with a Ninja, or processor/blender.*\n\n1/3 cup white sugar.\n\n*I used zero calorie monkfruit sugar substitute. I just used less. Most sugar substitutes are not 1:1.*\n\n*You can also use brown sugar, or any sweetener.*\n\n3 scoops vegan protein. \n\n*I used vanilla soy, unflavored rice protein, and vanilla pea together.*\n\n1/2 cup flax meal or flax seed. \n\n*It helps if you add this to water, and let it sit for a bit before adding to the bowl. Like a \"flax egg\".*\n\n4 overripe bananas, mashed in a bowl.\n\n*Mash 'em Good!*\n\n1/4 -1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.\n\n1/2 cup vegan butter.\n\n3 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n\n3 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n\n1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1 pinch salt\n\n1/2 cup water. \n\n*Or more if needed*. Dough should be a only a bit, wet, but not too wet*.\n\n1/2 cup chopped walnuts, apples, pecan, or whatever dried fruit, or nuts. This is optional.\n\nBaking Directions:\n\nMix together your drys - all flours, sugar, protein, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.\n\nMix together the wets - the bananas, vegan butter, flax meal, applesauce, water, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Let it sit for a few minutes. Slowly add the flour mixture to banana mixture. Stir until combined. \n\nTry not to over mix, but it's bread so it's not the end of the world if it does.\n\nMix in the extras if you optioned for any. \n\nTransfer batter into a loaf pan, or cake pan.\n\nBake at med-med high (350f - 400f depending on equipment, and geography) in a preheated oven for 45 - 50 min, or until a toothpick, or chopstick inserted into the center comes out clean.  \n\nLet it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. \n\nTransfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nOrange Glaze:\n\nI added this at the end, and I think it makes it a bit sweeter since the bread is so \"healthy\" tasting, but it's totally optional. \n\n1/2 teaspoons of orange extract, or about 2, or 2 1/2 tablespoons finely zested orange. \n\n1/4 cup sugar substitute.\n\n*If you are using regular confectioners sugar change it to 1/2 a cup.*\n\n3 tablespoons of any vegan milk.\n\n*I used Bored Cow Vanilla Milk.*\n\n*You can also use water, fresh lemon juice, or orange juice.*\n\n1/4 Tsp of vanilla extract.\n\nDrizzle glaze over top if you wish or use it as a bread dip. \n\nI refrigerated mine after glazing. You can also freeze this. \n\nI used a silicone bread loaf pan, and an 8 inch cake pan because there was too much for the bread pan.\n\nThis recipe is quite easy, however due to the amount of ingredients it may take some time to bake.\n\nI had to end up taking mine at 350 for almost 50 mins or so.",

Yes, that's right - **Pumpkin Spice** *everything!* :D  \n>  \n>And [Super Body Fuel](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/) is no exception. ;) **We're bringing back our much loved (and much missed)** ***pumpkin spice flavor*** **for this fall season.**  \n>  \n>Since it's just a limited-time, seasonal flavor, it won't be available for subscription at subscription prices, just as a one-off purchase. But don't worry, it's not going to be a \"premium flavor\" at premium prices - organic pumpkin pie spice mix isn't actually any more expensive than our usual flavors. We're saving that for our strawberry flavor, which *is* super expensive *(coming soon!)*. ;)  \n>  \n>In case you missed any of our previous announcements, here's what's been going on with us lately:  \n>  \n>* Scoops are now optional! **Reduce**, **reuse**, and recycle!\n>* **Strawberry**: to return shortly as a premium flavor!\n>  \n>And... here's what's coming up:  \n>  \n>* Organic rice protein: new supplier with better taste!\n>* Keto Fuel: sodium to be reduced to 100% DV.\n>* **Omega-3**: how about some vegan DHA?\n>  \n>Like that? ;) We found that about half the people using [Keto Fuel](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) aren't actually doing it for ketosis, and the people who do generally still have to add more salt. So to make it more accessible to people who need to keep their sodium low enough that they don't swell up or something, we'll be bringing the sodium down to 100% DV - the level of our other products - and including a recommendation to add up to 1/4 teaspoon of salt per meal as needed. Thanks to everyone who weighed in! :)  \n>  \n>I'm particularly excited about the new rice protein, especially since our old supplier has had a lot of variability in taste this year. But yes, you heard that right - **vegan DHA from algae**, not fish, the omega-3 fatty acid that is so critical for brain function. It's not cheap, but we've found a supplier with reasonable price, at long last. The future is upon us, that's for sure. ;p And you're worth it. <3  \n>  \n>Plus I'm tired of taking fish oil pills. ;)  \n>  \n>Of course, DHA isn't officially recognized as a required nutrient with a specified minimum intake, so we're going to have to depend on other sources for these guidelines. Which we always do do anyway, of course. ;) But if you have a particular recommendation or request for how much DHA to include per day, let us know! Just keep in mind this stuff is expensive. :p  \n>  \n>Anyway, looking forward to hearing from you! Happy Pumpkin Spice Season, all! :D  \n>  \n>Thanks!  \n>  \n>Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)\n\nAnd then:\n\n>Hi everyone,  \n>  \n>Hope you're enjoying Pumpkin Spice season! ;) Just wanted to give you all a quick heads up that our **Strawberry flavor is back in stock as a premium flavor**, this time for good! :D  \n>  \n>Now available for subscription as well as one-off purchases, for [Milk Fuel Strawberry](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/milk-fuel/?flavor=strawberry&size=40), [Athlete Fuel Strawberry](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/athlete-fuel/?flavor=strawberry), and [Super Fuel Strawberry](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fuel/?flavor=strawberry). Still no keto version, but we may revisit that with our new, more neutral-tasting rice protein, which we've just started using! :)  \n>  \n>Also, we are getting ready to update our formula with a vegan, algae-based DHA omega-3 powder, which we're super excited about! :D At this point, **we're thinking of targeting a dosage of 1200mg of omega-3 per day, 1000mg of which would be DHA**. Because this is the active form that is directly used in the brain, much lower doses are needed compared to, say, the ALA in chia or flax seed oil. The powder at that dose will add about 1-2g of net carbs per day to the Keto Fuel formula, though the daily net carbs would not exceed 10g even then.  \n>  \n>While we're at it, we're also considering whether we should add some other obscure nutrients to our formulas, such as Myo-Inositol and Acetyl-L-Carnitine. If you want to weigh in on any of those or the DHA addition, please take a moment to fill out [this quick survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_E4diFZNqMBfRrql3r3gp0YlIe9khxUc4PpNQ8Ah4k6uiXw/viewform?usp=sf_link) about it! :)  \n>  \n>I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback! Please check out the survey if you have a minute:  \n>  \n>[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf\\_E4diFZNqMBfRrql3r3gp0YlIe9khxUc4PpNQ8Ah4k6uiXw/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_E4diFZNqMBfRrql3r3gp0YlIe9khxUc4PpNQ8Ah4k6uiXw/viewform?usp=sf_link)  \n>  \n>Thank you! :D  \n>  \n>Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts in the survey and in the comments below! :) Thank you, as always!",

(lot #2019092606) But I will say that there is a fine granular texture even after a night in the fridge. Probably about the same as Soylent powder, and not at all unpleasant. I only mention it because I have recently also had Keto Chow which, due to its milk protein, is absolutely smooth.

    "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'd like to write this post for all of those who are currently suffering from a major crash and see no light at the end of the tunnel. I'd like to give some of you hope that things can improve even when things seem hopeless at the moment.\n\nMy last post from last year was a very negative one as I was in a very bad condition - I couldn't imagine getting out of the never-ending sequence of crashes. That's why it's important for me to post here again, as I'm feeling better now.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am only sharing my personal experience. This is not medical advice, please consult your personal doctor.*\n\nLast summer, I had the biggest crash in my entire life. I had already experienced two major crashes over the last 15 years, but this one left me bedridden and this time the symptoms were so severe that I thought my end was near.\n\nI could no longer walk and I was in a permanent state of pain, weakness, feeling like I wasn't getting enough air, brain fog, barely/no restful sleep possible, always tired but wired, sore throat, digestive issues, palpitations, POTS, nausea, dizziness, feeling thirsty and hungry all the time, sensitivity to light and noise, flu-like symptoms, any slightest physical or cognitive stress crashed me further.\n\nOnly in the morning did I still have enough energy to be pushed to the toilet in a wheelchair by my parents. But even going to the toilet was often too much for me and crashed me further. I spent the rest of the day in bed with my eyes closed or staring at the ceiling, gathering energy for the next visit to the toilet the next day. And this repeated itself week after week.\n\nMy parents called the ambulance several times because of my poor condition. But nobody was able to help me. I was also taken to hospital once, but nobody could help me there either and I was sent home again. The stress of the hospital visit caused another crash, especially because the paramedics who ended up carrying me to the ambulance forced me to walk myself beforehand, which of course wasn't possible and made me overexert myself.\n\nBy the end of the summer, due to crashing again and again, my condition had deteriorated to such an extent that I could hardly swallow any food. Digesting food took more energy than the food gave me. In the end, I didn't even have the strength to breathe. Every breath felt like hard work. Everything took too much energy, which I no longer had. I felt like I was dying. It was a truly horrible feeling.\n\nBut then the summer ended at some point and with it the temperatures dropped again. Somehow I had survived the summer with strict discipline/pacing and lethargic lying in bed.\n\nOver the next few months, I was gradually able to eat a little better and listen to things on my smartphone during the day. But the general symptoms were still there. Then in January I was able to sit in bed again for a limited time during the day and look at things on my smartphone. However, the next summer was already approaching and with it warm temperatures again. Even though my condition had improved slightly, I still felt too weak and unstable to get through the pollen season and the returning warm temperatures period.\n\nThe breakthrough came in March this year, when I was finally able to find a specialist for ME/CFS who was willing to talk to me via video consultation. The doctor took a detailed medical history, had me fill out several questionnaires, carried out blood tests and finally diagnosed me with post-viral fatigue syndrome (= ME/CFS). After 15 years of a medical odyssey with doctors who are at a loss and repeated wrong / psychosomatic diagnoses and therefore wrong treatment approaches, I finally have a diagnosis that really matches my cluster of symptoms. The blood test revealed a severe vitamin D deficiency and evidence of reactivated viral infections.\n\nBased on the results, the doctor drew up a treatment plan for me which includes:\n- anti-inflammatory, low histamine diet\n- sufficient protein intake\n- vagus exercises\n- vitamins, minerals \n- dietary supplements that have a supportive effect in the following areas:\nmitochondria, inflammation, immune system, biofilms, viruses, gut\n- low-dose naltrexone (LDN)\n\nAdequate protein intake in particular seems to have a good effect. Even many years before I was diagnosed with ME/CFS, I always felt the need to eat additional protein powder to feel full or to have the feeling of having energy and not crashing. As I have a lot of cross allergies, I only use rice protein powder now (mixing it with pea protein powder seems to give a better amino acid profile, but I personally am allergic to pea protein powder).\n\nSince I have been following the treatment plan, I have been getting notably better - bit by bit. The pain has decreased, my digestion has improved, I generally feel more balanced, the brain fog has decreased and I generally have a bit more energy and can now exert myself a bit more before PEM sets in.\n\nI can now do things again like sitting in bed most of the day, using the smartphone, brushing my teeth with the manual toothbrush, shaving myself and occasionally pushing myself around the house sitting on the rollator.\n\nI'm still a long way from my pre-crash state and I don't know if I will ever reach the pre-crash state again, but the fact that I can do little things myself again and I'm not in constant pain is a big step forward for me.\n\nWith my experience report, I would like to give some hope to those of you who are currently in a massive crash. I can't guarantee that you will get better, but there is a chance that the situation can improve with time and the right help, even if I wouldn't have believed it myself a year ago.",

    "body": "Hi, I just wanna preface this by saying I al not a brand ambassador and I’m not being paid for this. I genuinely like this product and think it would be helpful to other people like me so I refuse to gatekeep it.\n\nI’m allergic to dairy, tree nuts & peanuts, so it’s very difficult for people like me who want to be fit and grow muscle to find a protein powder solution. The main way is… whey, and if you can’t have that then you have your nut based options. Lately plant-based options have been gaining popularity- but these options use protein from sprouted peas… which are legumes and share properties with peanuts. For me, the plant based option made my stomach turn due to my peanut allergy. So what now? \n\nEnter the other plant based option. Brown. Rice. Protein. I can’t believe I never thought of it before! Sure enough though I tried it out and had no reaction whatsoever. My body tolerated it perfectly (though my tongue may have not- I’ll get to that).\n\nHere’s the good, the bad & the dirty, but these may be different for you:\n\nThe good:\n- Free from all major allergens\n- High in protein (25g per serving)\n- Relatively inexpensive (in bulk)\n\nThe bad:\n- The cheapest option is to get it unflavored, which has a sort of plaster taste.\n- The texture is nothing to look forward to either (I use a straw to get it as far past my mouth as possible, which helps a LOT)\n\nThe dirty (literally):\n- It’s a powder so there’s a chance things could get messy, but no more than working with flour!\n- Do NOT leave your protein shaker with this unwashed (I made the mistake of letting one sit for three weeks and when I finally opened it to clean it, we had to open all the windows and doors to vent the house)\n- Apologize to your loved ones in advance, protein rich supplements have the potential to cause some pretty noxious… southern wind.\n\nAll in all, as people with food allergies we make a lot of concessions. It’s no shocker to me that something like brown rice protein powder that’s allergy safe might be a little harder to get past the tongue, but hey that’s our life. And maybe it’s mine, but it doesn’t have to be yours! Brown rice protein powder could be a great addition to baking recipes or smoothies, it depends how adventurous you are. Or if you just want to knock it back with a glass of water, more power to you.\n\nBrown rice protein powder is an excellent alternative for individuals with dairy and nut allergies.\n\nFor recommendations I would suggest: Zen Principle Organic Brown Rice Protein 6 LB. USDA Certified Organic. Unflavored. Non-GMO. Vegan.\n\nAgain, not being paid, don’t care if you buy it or not. Just really enjoy it and think someone else might too.\n",

I'll get right into it with the progress pics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BEFORE \\(143lb 2019\\)](https://imgur.com/a/9Xw6oE1) \n\n[AFTER \\(171lb 2021\\)](https://imgur.com/a/9jWx8Qn)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**Backstory**\n\nLike many of you, I had always been a skinny kid, not eating properly, known as a 'skeleton'. I never really had a large appetite and at the same time I was also relatively active meaning that it was very hard for me to gain weight. Eventually after 23 years and at the weight of 143 lbs I decided enough was enough, and I started my serious weight gain journey in 2019. I initially started with the [reddit PPL routine](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EgdyXYQAWBBNhlUlzOdq1HjyFUf-scsVMlHNviYaVug/edit#gid=0) as I wanted to spend as much time in the gym as possible to be efficient. During this time I was forcing myself to eat much more, around 3k calories, mainly relying on smoothies to boost my calories (will talk about this later). This worked very well, after just 6 months of this I gained around 20 lbs and was feeling much more confident and healthy. \n\nThings were going great but then in 2020 the pandemic hit and brought with it lockdowns and gym closures. I tried to maintain with home workouts but was lacking equipment and really struggled to stay disciplined with bodyweight exercises. My mental health also suffered. Over 2020 I lost around 11 lbs and felt quite demotivated.\n\nWith the start of this year however I picked things up again, I started eating much more (averaging around 3400 calories a day), making my smoothies again, and doing a few home workouts and planning a new workout routine so that when the gyms re-opened around a month ago I hit the ground running. Since April I have consistently gone to the gym at least 3 times a week and take my workouts seriously. Since the start of this year, I went from 154 lbs to 171 lbs which is where I'm at now and the most I've ever weighed and I am really happy about it, it was amazing to see how quickly I recovered to my previous strength levels. Also, having my old pants which I always needed a belt for suddenly be way too tight, and have the button rip was something I previously never imagined would happen to me and felt incredible!\n\nI guess the biggest thing I've learned is that this is a marathon, not a race. Even though I made very respectable gains early on, I did have some major setbacks. After having lost that weight and not having been in the gyms I could have just given up entirely, especially dwelling on all the lost time, but I decided to stop making excuses and not let that happen. I used my previous knowledge to recover myself and hit new maxes within a short time frame, muscle memory is a wonderful thing as well!! I also think what helped prevent me losing too much muscle mass during my time of inactivity was that I was continuing to have a protein shake every day, so I would advise anyone that finds themselves in a position where they are unable to work out to continue having a high protein intake. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LIFTS**\n\nHere are some lift progress stats from since I first started and where I'm at today:\n\nDeadlift 1x5 99 lbs ---> 3x5 253 lbs (being limited by my grip at the moment, working on resolving this)\n\nBench Press 3x5 77 lbs ---> 5x5 158 lbs\n\nSquat 3x5 88 lbs ---> 5x5 176 lbs (skipped quite a lot of leg days admittedly, but I do cycle a lot and live in a city with many steep hills, my legs seem proportionate for now)\n\nOHP 5x5 44 lbs ----> 5x5 116 lbs\n\nLat Pulldown 3x8 85 lbs ---> 3x12 165 lbs\n\nPullups 3x5 ---> 3x12\n\n\nAs far as workout routine goes, I ditched the PPL after about a year and recently I've been doing a 3 day full body routine that revolves around the 3 main lifts+some accessories. I'm really enjoying this since I like having the days off for recovery/cardio, and longer gym sessions for when I do go in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n**MY BEST ADVICE** \n\nfor those starting off I recommend stop overthinking things, I used to also suffer from trying to find the perfect routine, the perfect meal plan. Everybody is different, the meal plan that works for others might not work for you, the important thing is you gotta just EAT MORE and put more calories in. I personally started slowly increasing my meal sizes, looking at labels of food/ready meals in the supermarket and chose ones with the highest calories (this was before I started cooking). If you obsess with being perfect, such as following a very strict diet and workout routine you risk burning yourself out and making the whole journey too daunting. Throughout my time I definitely had weeks where I skipped working out, or would go out drinking and partying occasionally, etc. Was this Ideal? No. But what I did was still good enough and I still made gains. \n\nI do think the biggest thing that helped me was making calorie-dense smoothies that I could consistently have every day even when I didn't have much appetite or was busy, I will put the recipe below. \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1100 calorie smoothie recipe**\n\nOk so I have experimented with many smoothies during my time gaining and I have finally settled on something that works for me extremely well and is super simple and easy to consume. \n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING A LARGE BLENDER (mine has 800ml capacity, if yours is smaller you will have to adjust the recipe accordingly). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make this:\n\n1.   Put 90g oats (steel cut or rolled) and optionally 25g of seeds of your preference (I personally love pumpkin and sunflower seeds) into the blender. Add water till it fills around halfway of the blender. Blend 3-4 times in bursts of a few seconds.\n2. Now it's time to add 60g (2 scoops) of the protein powder of your choice. Due to a history of skin problems I personally avoid whey and instead use a mix of pea and rice protein (chocolate brownie flavoured). \n3. Add one heaped tablespoon of peanut butter (around 40g) and then a splash of olive oil on top (I personally put around 10ml, feel free to adjust as you see fit). \n4. Now add water again until the waterline is around half an inch from the top of the blender to ensure it doesn't overfill. \n5. Blend in short bursts 3-4 times\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd there you have it, a 1100 calorie shake that is healthy and (in my opinion) tasty. Keep in mind though this one is not so sweet (it's more savoury since I'm trying to cut down on sugar, personal preference) so if you prefer a sweeter smoothie consider adding some other flavourings such as chocolate spread or replacing some ingredients with fruit.\n\n\n **ALSO SUPER IMPORTANT TIP TO MAKE DRINKING THIS EASIER, GET YOURSELF SOME FAT STRAWS, THE BIGGEST YOU CAN FIND**. Drinking this with a large straw means that you can very quickly suck this directly into your stomach, this makes it very quick to consume and I have consistently been able to have this even when I wasn't feeling so hungry. I like to gulp it down FAST, before my stomach can even decide that it's too full, I find it's better this way rather than slowly sipping and you also save yourself some time, but do what works for you. \n\nAlso, I highly recommend not finishing it in one sitting as you might feel bloated. I normally make this smoothie in the evening and then drink half of it after dinner around 1-2 hours before bed, put it in the fridge and have the other half right after breakfast. I find this way is the easiest to digest and creates minimal disruption with other meals (I get hungry again right in time for lunch). YMMV\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways this has turned into somewhat of a megapost, for those that have made it this far thanks for reading, I hope some of you will find some of this information useful and that it can motivate you to start/keep going. I know compared to some guys here my progress is not anything incredible, however, I am still proud of what I achieved and I hope this shows that even with major setbacks and difficulties you can still make decent gains if you set your mind to it. If anyone has advice about something they noticed or areas where I'm lacking please do share. My next goal is 187 lbs, I will make another update once I'm there. \n\nWe're all gonna make it!\n\nEDIT: Age in title is wrong, I am currently 25 and started my journey when I was 23.",

I'd sometimes have it twice a day if I was lacking that much. I think the oats gave me reflux that even with meds didn't go away but it was all totally worth putting up with it to make progress. Due to covid I had to take a long time off, managed to maintain my weight without the shakes which was great now I've trained my body to take in more calories! After 5-6months off I've just started training again and hoping once I've worn out the muscle memory/newbie gains again I can continue to make progress without relying on shakes so much  (although that probably just means more peanut butter throughout the day lol).",

Just natural flavor, clean ingredients, and a complete amino acid profile.\n\nWe’re calling it **Tronk**, and we’re still in development. But we’ve started writing about what we’re learning — about protein quality, ingredient transparency, and why we think there’s a need for simpler, more honest options.\n\nIf you’re curious, our site is here: [https://tronkprotein.com](https://tronkprotein.com)  \n(again, nothing for sale yet — just info and articles)\n\nWe’d love to know:\n\n* What’s been your biggest issue with vegan protein powders?\n* Do you prefer unflavored? Naturally flavored? Ready to mix?\n* What would your *ideal* plant-based protein look like?\n\nThanks for reading — and if this kind of post isn’t allowed, we’ll gladly remove it. Just wanted to hear what you guys think. ",

The other is a **new form of potassium**, with a much more neutral flavor. We’ve phased out Potassium Citrate, which is very bitter and sour, and replaced it with Potassium Bicarbonate, which is the most neutral-tasting potassium source we’ve found, according to our taste tests and the feedback of our volunteers. This should make a big difference in both [Keto Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) and [Light Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/light-fuel/) especially, as they are high in added potassium. Not only that, but it has allowed us to reduce the amount of Monkfruit Extract used as a sweetener, which should reduce the sweetener aftertastes that some people experience.\n\nYou can read more on [the blog](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/july-2017-update/). :) **All of the [Keto Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) flavors *except Plain* have switched over to the new version**, with MCTs, new rice protein, and potassium bicarbonate.\n\n*And because of that, we're also putting [Keto Fuel Plain](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) on sale ($40 instead of $50!) until we sell off the old stock! ;)*\n\nI'm really excited to hear what you all think of the new version. Please share when you've had a chance to try it! :D",

They help to bind up these metal ions contaminants to keep the product microbe free for longer shelf life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMetal ions without a chelating agent are most likely to cause problems in DIY formulas, including:\n\n* Spoilage and rancidity\n* Degradation of vitamins and essential fatty acids\n* Fragrance/essential oil degradation\n* Discoloration\n* Cloudy formation and precipitation\n* Poor foaming and rinsability performance\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's essential to use a chelating agent if your DIY formula contains: \n\n* Botanical extracts/powders \n* Aloe vera juice/gel/powder \n* Hydrosols/floral waters/distillates/essences \n* Proteins (e.g. hydrolyzed oat and rice protein)\n* Honey and its derivatives (e.g. honeyquat and royal jelly) \n* Herbal/fruit powders\n* Clay\n* Thickening agents (e.g. starches and glucose)\n* Unrefined/unfiltered waxes (e.g. beeswax and flower waxes)\n* Lecithin\n\n# EDTA:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEthylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a molecule which complexes metal ions in aqueous environments. It is available in four neutralizations, two of which, disodium EDTA and tetrasodium EDTA are commonly used in the cosmetics. The choice of which product to use is determined by the intended pH of your product.\n\nDisodium EDTA is commonly used in neutral to mildly acidic products, such as toners, serums, creams, and neutral pH cleansers. Tetrasodium EDTA is recommended for alkaline products, like cleansers and shampoos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecommend usage rates:\n\n* Disodium EDTA = 0.1%-0.3%\n* Tetrasodium EDTA = 0.1%\n\n# Other chelators:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease keep in mind that disodium EDTA is a strong chelating agent than any of these chelators. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGlucono Delta Lactone is a polyhydroxy acid, the next generation of alpha hydroxy acid. It is recommended for acidic formulas. When it is dissolved in water, it will slowly hydrolyze to gluconic acid which produces gentle acidification in the same way as lactic acid-producing bacteria. It has several benefits: moisturizing and hydrating effects, may even smooth skin texture, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSodium phytate is an alternative of disodium EDTA and tetrasodium EDTA. It is the sodium salt of phytic acid and a natural substance found in plant seeds. It can be used in acidic and alkaline formulas. It has additional benefits: moisturizes skin, improves skin elasticity, normalizes oily skin, may help reduce pore size, helps lighten skin, and may help improve the appearance of cellulite. It has a pH of 12 - may need to adjust the pH's formula to bring it down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCitric acid is widely used in cosmetics to adjust pH in formulations, has mild chelating properties, and is also used as an antioxidant to improve the effects of other antioxidants. Citric acid is intended for acidic formulas only.  This shouldn't be the first choice for chelating agent especially if your DIY formula has too many botanical extracts or a high percentage of aloe vera/hydrosol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecommended usage rates:\n\n* Glucono Delta Lactone: 0.1%-1%\n* Sodium phytate: 0.1%-0.5%\n* Citric acid: 0.1%-1%",

    "body": "**Product Review for Stratia Rewind 5% Niacinamide and 2.5% DMAE serum**\n\n**Price:** $16 USD for 1 fl oz.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Claims:** “In scientific studies, DMAE has been shown to reduce the appearance of lines and fine wrinkles and improve the overall appearance of aging skin. Niacinamide can regulate cell turnover, fade hyperpigmentation, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and strengthen your skin barrier. A few key plant extracts - licorice root, Centella asiatica, and tamarind seed - run the gamut of anti-aging powers, from fading dark spots to powerful antioxidant abilities.\n\nEvery ingredient in Rewind is there for a reason, and that reason is giving you smooth, plump, radiant skin. It’s light yet hydrating enough to be used by all skin types. Use it before your usual moisturizer to give your skin a blast to the past.\n\nLike all Stratia products, Rewind is unfragranced, gimmick-free, and formulated based on hard science.”\n\n**Review:** Alright, here we go, if you’d like a shortened version, there will be a summary at the end. Otherwise, buckle in for this ride.\n\nI purchased this on the 18th of May, received it on the 22nd and have since been using it twice a day every single day. My skin is usually dry and dehydrated but is now normal and hydrated af, more on that later. My skin concerns are hormonal acne, clogged pores and texture. I purchased this instead of the TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc since I wasn’t sure how the zinc would affect my dry skin and I was worried about the potential irritation from such a high concentration of niacinamide. Plus, the addition of DMAE in this formula seemed promising.\n\nMy first impression was that the serum had an odd texture. It isn’t unpleasant at all, but it feels different than any other hydrator I’ve ever applied to my skin. It has more body to it. I originally mixed it with my The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid serum because it felt a bit weird to layer one on and then the other since this serum had a thicker consistency. It feels kind of tacky on the skin but it goes away pretty quickly and there’s zero smell whatsoever.\n\nY’all, my skin is the best that it’s ever been. The only product that changed in my routine was this (anything I removed was removed after seeing the improvements caused by this product).  The rough, bumpy texture of my skin has completely minimized to the degree that it’s practically disappeared. My skin used to suck up all the hydration I gave it but never held on to it. Regardless of the moisturizer I used or how many layers of hydrating products, within an hour or two it would go back to feeling dry, and rough. Now my skin is soft and hydrated all day. My skin no longer appears dull, I can even see the light bouncing off of my skin. I don’t even *need* to use a thick cream moisturizer anymore like I used to. I can get away with a simple gel, an emulsion or the thinnest layer of cream and my skin is completely fine. I can moisturize my face just once in the day and that dry, and the tight feeling never returns.\n\nI stopped using a vitamin c serum and this was just as effective at fading marks of hyperpigmentation. This has also helped in keeping my pores from clogging as much since I no longer need heavy products. I ran out of my HA serum less than halfway into using this and have seen more improvements in my skin using this as my sole hydrator. I’m only halfway through the bottle but I’ve already ordered a backup because this has become a permanent product in my routine. If I’d known that my skin would have flourished like this, I would have bought this months ago and saved myself so much money on trial and error.\n\n**My routine prior to adding this:**\n\n***AM***\n\n1. Water Rinse\n2. The Inkey List HA serum\n3. TO Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (I dropped this recently because it’s been clogging the fuck out of my pores and now I have two giant pimples on my forehead and whiteheads everywhere) or Stratia Liquid Gold (won’t be repurchasing simply because I no longer need it, but this was a nice product. I still have less than an ounce of this left).\n4. Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence or Black Girl Sunscreen\n\n***PM***\n\n1. Cleanse with Dr. Loretta’s Gentle Hydrating Cleanser or Paula’s Choice Defense Gel-to-Cream cleanser\n2. Matsuyama Hadauru Balancing toner (I just stopped using this since Rewind seems to be making the actual difference in my hydration)\n3. The Inkey List Retinol / TO Lactic Acid 10% (this is like once a week once every 2 weeks) / TO Salicylic Acid 2% (only when needed)\n4. The Inkey List HA serum (ran out of this, won’t repurchase)\n5. Etude House SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream\n\n**My Current Routine:**\n\n***AM***\n\n1. Water Rinse\n2. Stratia Rewind\n3. Etude House SoonJung Emulsion or Barrier Intensive Cream or skip straight to sunscreen\n\n***PM***\n\n1. Same cleansers\n2. Stratia Rewind\n3. Same actives\n4. Etude House SoonJung Emulsion or Barrier Intensive Cream\n\n**Summary**: I feel like this is bottled up angel tears and holy water. It’s left my skin firm, plump, and hydrated and has normalized my skin, faded my hyperpigmentation, and softened my texture. It's replaced my HA serums and my hydrating toners.  This is the one product I've tried where I felt it achieved all it claimed to do.",

        "body": "Very nice!!! Have you had a chance to use it yet? I make a similar conditioner except I use silicones. I made a version without it and used a small percentage of butters which wasn't the best for my hair but it was amazing for my mom, who has shorter wavy hair. She usually has an issue with her hair having too much body, so it made her hair more manageable and left it with a really nice polished look. I thought she had used some hot tools. For my hair and my daughters it was a little too much weight where my hair ended up too straight. I have wavy hair with curls at the ends, that I finally love. Most of my life I hated how poofy my hair was and I wanted it straight and sleek. Now I am the opposite and like my hair when it dries on its own, especially when I have little ringlets at the ends. The shorter my hair is the more curls I have, but I have a lot of hair and the weight will pull the curls out. \n\nTry pouring the oil into the water phase, I think it might be the issue, you shouldn't have to go over 20 minutes of heating and holding. I usually give it 10 minutes to make sure they are both at the same temperature and everything is melted. \n\nDo you have an immersion or a high shear mixer like the mini one that LC has? I slowly pour the oil phase in with the mini pro for high shear in the water. After the initial mixing I switch over to an immersion blender because my mini mixer isn't long enough once the emulsion starts fluffy up. \n\nI made a conditioner last week and had my back door open and the heat at 63, and that was a mistake because when I was pouring the oil phase it started to solidify in the beaker. I tried putting it back in the hot water bath while still mixing the two phases and of course because there wasn't much in the oil beaker it wanted to float, so I was trying to hold it still with my glass stirring rod. I was really wishing for more arms in the moment. It wasn't much that solidified but now I know not to have it so cold in the house.\n\nAdd the honeyquat in the cool down phase because it's heat sensitive and it can make your conditioner smell. I usually add hydrolyzed proteins in the cool down phase because I thought they were heat sensitive. Susan from swift crafty monkey adds them in the cool down phase, but I recently was on chemist's corner and Perry stated that heat cannot hurt hydrolyzed proteins because they are already broken down. I am going to do a little more research on it. Whenever I see them say something different I do some digging because I trust both of them when it comes to formulating.\n\nI know that botanicals should be added to the cool down phase because they can chemically degrade. But I am not positive if aloe is heat sensitive or not.",

        "body": "Looks great!\n\nI'd leave out the honeyquat, as it is completely overshadowed by the BTMS. I'd reduce or remove the panthenol, because it is expensive again right now.  5% hydrolyzed protein is a lot, but it is fine if you like it. You could lower the cetyl to 2% and add a bit more of one of the liquid oils. Or try it without the liquid oils. Or without the extra cetyl alcohol. Lots of things to try if you aren't quite happy with it.\n\nA few thoughts on process, because using the right amount of preservative has been covered. I don't use that one, but you should keep it at 0.5% (or whatever the supplier recommends). \n\nAre you using a non-contact thermometer or a regular digital dip in? Are you measuring the temp of the water bath or the phase itself? What are you heating it in that takes such a long time? Either way, heat it a bit higher, not longer. There's nothing to be gained by heating longer as BTMS-50 is fine once you get it above 70C. It's fine at 80. Or even up to 90 (not ideal but it was fine). 65 C is too low. BTMS-50 is not too picky about using hotter water phase, but a cooler one can cause problems.\n\nWith the chunks, were you using a water phase that was at least 70 C? Are any of your water phase powder ingredients not dissolved all the way? Is your water phase clear before you put the two phases tgether? \n\nBy hand mixer, I'm assuming it is not an immersion blender. With 7% BTMS and 3.5% cetyl alcohol, that would not be a pumpable product if you used an immersion blender. It is kind of funny when I give someone a light lotion and later they thank me for the body butter.\n\nIf your arms or neck or back hurt from holding the mixer, get an immersion blender. Any immersion blender will do. I have a cheap one as well as a very nice one. They both make emulsions. (If it is full length plastic, do not use it to mix in fragrances. The smell might never go away, and it will be one you hate.)\n\nCold water bath works way better and faster than just stirring. If you're using a heavy glass bowl, it will take forever to cool down since the glass has to cool down too. In that case, stirring can't cool it any faster than just leaving it sitting. I don't advise putting hot glass into a cold water bath though. I changed to using steel because I am impatient, and I like things that won't break from thermal or impact stress. (Heating cycles will weaken glass and one day it will break. Mason jars are tempting, but they will eventually betray you. I'm also clumsy.)\n\nThe bubbles might be from pouring warm. Just leave the lid off until it is fully cooled down.",

    "body": "Hey folks,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wrote a comment today for someone who was feeling overwhelmed with starting low FODMAP, and I figured it'd be good to share around. Definitely also share any hacks you have :)\n\nI did low FODMAP cold turkey about a year ago for close to 6 months in a house with university students and I quickly found some hacks that work for me to help me be successful, while also maintaining a good food lifestyle.\n\nDisclaimer: This is just based on my experience! I am not a professional, or a dietician. A low FODMAP diet *should* be supervised by a licensed Dietician. Also sorry for the long post. :)\n\n\\---------------------\n\n **General**\n\n* Print this out: [https://www.ibsdiets.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IBSDiets-FODMAP-chart.pdf](https://www.ibsdiets.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IBSDiets-FODMAP-chart.pdf) put it wherever you might be making food. It saves a ton of random google searches.\n* Everyone has different tastes and cooking abilities, but your general goal should be to find yourself a rotating set of meals or food items that are safe, and FODMAP friendly. What carbs do you like to eat? Is rice easier than potatoes for you? What proteins are the quickest after a long day of work. Stuff like that!\n*  Don't beat yourself up if you accidentally eat a FODMAP. Monitor yourself for symptoms and reset your clean out period if you get symptoms.\n*  Conversely, be patient. It took me almost 3 full weeks to be symptom free even on the strictest of elimination. I didn't experience relief right away\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Food Prep**\n\n If  you're going to buy anything prepackaged, you must read the ingredients  unfortunately. Common gotchas are chicory root/inulin, modified milk ingredients and the sugar alcohols (xylitol, etc)\n\n For me, a **pressure cooker** was a big saver. I know money is tight these days, but it  makes a huge huge difference in the quality of food that you can make.  Instant pots are a godsend, but thrift stores often have stove top ones  that work too. You can make exciting rice, yummy chicken dishes that  require very little input energy. \n\nRoasting things in the oven is also your friend. Roast some chicken with a  neutral oil, and some agreeable herbs spices and salt. Take a fodmap  friendly vegetable like peppers, sweet potatoes or carrots and toss em  in the oven for some delicious sides.\n\nEssential seasonings: Nutritional yeast, peppers, salt, cumin, paprika, basil, and tumeric \n\n\\-----------------\n\n***Meals***\n\nThe general form for me was something like:\n\n Breakfast: FODMAP Friendly Bread + thing to put on top/ lactose free dairy product + fruit/Small cup of oatmeal (1/2 cup max)\n\n Lunch: GF Pasta dish with Low fodmap sauce/Small salad + fish/Quinoa + sliced raw veg \n\nSupper: Okay, so for supper I basically always built around Protein + carb + vegetable (very food guide of me) and just picked from that list based on what I was feeling. \n\n* Protein: Canned Fish, Tofu, Random protein shake usually with rice protein, Cheese, Chicken occasionally \n* Carb: Quinoa, Rice, Potatoes\n*  Vegetable: Carrots, red peppers, root vegetables, bean sprouts, cucumber, broccoli etc. \n\nThe focus here is that these preparations should be mostly 3-4 single main ingredient preparations or one pot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example: \n\n\\- Roasted chicken(salt, oil, pepper, herb mix of your choice that's fodmap), Mashed Potatoes(Potatoes, salt, Vegan Butter, dill maybe LF sour cream if you fancy), and sliced veggies (I love a veggie tray, so like carrots cucumbers, etc )\n\n\\- Cold quinoa salad with canned fish and diced veggies etc etc \n\nThese can all be made meal prep sunday style, or on demand with low effort.\n\n You don't need to make garlic  infused oil for your onion free ratatouille. Just think really really  simple combos of food that a) you are content with eating and b) aren't prepared in a way that triggers you.\n\n Also if you're a vegetarian, i'm sorry and I feel your pain because that shit is HARD. I had to go back to eating meat when I was trialing fodmap because so many of the  alternative proteins are out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tea** \n\n*sigh* Tea is a tough topic. Herbal tea has to be weak, caffiene can give you IBS-D symptoms etc etc. I also can't handle coffee so that really just left me with green tea. I learned to love green tea by getting decent grade japanese green tea. It's a completely different experience. But honestly, tea is mostly worth a skip on FODMAP, imo.\n\n \\------------------------\n\n**Specific FODMAPS**\n\n**Lactose** \\-  Lactose is pretty easy these days, with lactose free milk and tons of  plant based milks around (just be sure to do your research, almond and  coconut are guarantees). Cheese is still on, just make sure it's hard\n\n**Fructans** \n\n\\-  Avoiding alliums (onions and garlic) is INSANELY difficult in  prepackaged food, there's dried onion and garlic is so so so many places  you wouldn't expect. In that regard, for snacks, stick to the neutral  flavours as much as possible. Rice crisps, original flavour potato chips etc.  Make really really good friends with the green part of green onion for  that oniony flavour in a dish too. \n\n\\- If  you're a big soup person, try to find some fodmap free bouillons or  broth. It does exist, but they are hard to find. GoBio's chicken boullion is low fodmap, if you're in NA. \n\n\\-  now for avoiding wheat, if you like bread, I wouldn't recommend buying a  gluten free bread. I personally wasn't a fan of most of the non-wheat  products. a white sourdough is low fodmap, but it has to be an authentic  fermented sourdough (the easiest way to tell is if there's lactic acid  in the ingredient list, that's the lazy way out) . Spelt sourdough is  also fodmap friendly.\n\n\\- I LOVE  pasta, like it's a main staple for me. Giving it up was very difficult  because I found few pastas had the same texture, but a 100% corn flour  pasta gives a similar taste and texture. Make peace with rice noodles  lol.\n\nI'm not going to cover the  other categories in detail because in my experience they didn't come up a  lot. Not an exaustive list but some general rules to follow \n\n**Fructose**, just avoid Sugary drinks, fruit juice, honey, and apples.\n\n**polyols**  \\- Avoid mushrooms, all stone fruit and most berries and watch for  artificial sweeteners in sugar free stuff (if it's a -tol no go. Aspartame is okay)\n\n**Galactans**: The only acceptable bean and bean products are bean sprouts, non-silken tofu  (think firm tofu, but you must drain the water and rinse it) and green beans. That's it. No lentils, no black beans NOTHING.\n\n\\----\n\n**Eating out:**\n\nHonestly,  the list is very very small. All European cuisine is out, as is Indian,  Mexican, and most of south asia. The #1 FODMAP cuisine I've found is **Japanese.**  Since Rice is foundational, there is little to no reliance on wheat  across the board. Soy Sauce is fodmap friendly, and traditional miso  soup is on the table (the broth is typically made from kelp and bonito  flakes, both of which are low fodmap, but using a western broth base can  cancel this completely. YMMV).\n\nAs  long as the sushi ingredient is fodmap friendly, you're all good.\n\nGotchas:\n\n\\-Tempura typically has wheat in it. - Some low quality california  rolls will use flour to thicken the mixture since it is cheaper than  mayo. imitation crab can also contain sorbitol as well. Definitely  avoid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway that's what I got. I hope this post was helpful!",

    "body": "Hello! I received a sample of the **strawberry milkshake shampoo bar from Athame and Alchemy** for free after a discussion with the owner when they saw my comment indicating curiosity about the product and a lack of reviews. I wanted to provide a review since I had been curious to see if there had been any out there when the new one had been released last time around. In other relavent information, I have only tried the waxes from Athame and Alchemy from last year's gift exchange (thank you! I'm an exceptionally big fan of #PSL but loved everything).\n\n**Hair deets:** a couple inches short of waist length, coarse and porous, prone to frizz in higher humidity, mix of waves and curls\n\n**Typical hair routine:** wash every 2-4 days, depending on how dirty it is. Shampoo to the scalp, rinse out elsewhere. Conditioner from the bottom up, tiny bit on the top. \n\n**Experience with solid shampoo:** Tried four other brands. The only terrible one was Lush before the most recent reformulation. Absolutely dried out my hair and left it brittle and stiff. Been using my preferred brand for nearly a year now. \n\n**Other notes:** This was a free sample sent to me after I mentioned that I would be willing to try it other than the shipping cost to Canada (no one's fault!). It did come via lettermail successfully, but did not stay intact. I decided to crush it more evenly then firmly press it into a round mold. It has mostly stayed intact since. This may have changed the foaming and delivery experience. \n\n**On arrival:**\n\n- Strawberry milk scented, slightly candied a bit of juicy tartness. Not overwhelming through the packaging, could smell several inches away dry\n- Arrived crushed and powdered. Pushed into mold and got mostly cohesive product. Just under 1 tbsp of product after reforming it. \n\n**First use:**\n\n- Wet, similar scent throw\n- Surprising amount of lather (possibly due to water saturation in air pockets from press though)\n- Silky touch to the foam that built quickly in my hands (preferred for me), also easy to apply straight to hair in along length motion, but did not try to rub due to press \n- First try, washed out with normal amount of foam, but only in targeted location\n- Second go immediately after, continued to add more foam until entire top of head felt silky with foam. Rinse out very easy, felt hair was almost stripped/clarified, but not dried out (felt similarly when first time using solid shampoo, likely overwashed, oops)\n- Shampoo scent does not have strong throw after shower, though scent is more milky\n\n**Round two:**\n\n- less foamy (now normal level), still quickly foamed, rubbed a bit into hair after initial foam layer\n- slightly sour scent? \n- no lingering scent, not stripping, left glossy hair when only conditioned lower half\n\n**Rounds three - five:**\n\n- consistent with round two. \n- Still have around 3-4 uses left if it's not too small. Significantly more than what is advertised, but I would get about 10 normal uses out of it. \n- Hair feels nice and cleaned, but requires a touch up on the third day consistently. Feels like a faint residue sticks around as a hydrating layer. \n\n**Value:** good independent of the price. Very good considering the price of competitors (not including those that claim soap = shampoo that aren't pH balanced), especially as you can purchase a larger form to cut down on shipping frequency. Currently priced at 13.75/large ones.\n\n**Ingredients:** Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Rice Starch, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Rice Bran Oil, Fragrance, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Germall Plus (different for the Rosemary option)\n\n**Scent:** Ripe Strawberries, Buttercream Frosting, Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Spun Sugar\n\n**More notes:** My partner also used the shampoo bar once and confirmed it smelled like strawberry milk. It looks as if there are still a few more uses left. Just from eyeballing it, it looks as if the sample size is around 2/3 of the usual sample size rounds from other brands, but I could have compressed it more due to it being crushed in transit. I also forgot entirely it was strawberry *milkshake* sceented. While I can see it, my mind definitely jumps to strawberry milk first. **Overall it's a very hydrating product that feels like it leaves a thin film on the hair. Overuse can turn it into a more stripping product if that's needed. The scent is light, but present, and washes out. I did not find that my hair colour faded exceptionally fast with its use. The texture of the foam was silky and on the low foam side initially, but it was easy to build up. I did feel like I had to wash my hair slightly more freqently than with other shampoo options. Value wise, if I could stock up and not get bored for two years, I would consider purchasing these even with the horrific shipping costs. The sample size is an excellent option to just give it a go if you use shampoo at the same rate as I do (usually double the number of uses listed).**\n\nFeel free to ask more questions! I've just copied over the notes I had on what stood out to me at the time.\n\nEdit: come to think of it, that slight filmy feel I get...I wonder if it reduces frizz? I haven't noticed any more during the test runs at least. Edit 2: I've actually tried four brands! One was so mediocre and drying that I wiped it out from my memory.",

        "body": "Yes, I just got the rice milk soap from Athame and Alchemy and have so far had a similar experience! First off, it smells *really* good to me. I used a ton on the first try--really lathered it up in there--partly because it smells to good and partly because the foam does indeed feel so silky and lovely in my hair. When I rinsed, my hair felt a bit squeaky clean (not usually the goal for this curly head, but nice when I want to clarify a bit or need a deeper clean than usual) but also not super dehydrated/angry/rough like my hair can be with shampoo. Using it a bit more moderately, I like it a lot! The rest of my hair care routine needs some tweaking, so it's hard for me to say just on the basis of hair results, but the experience of using this bar is really lovey. Thank you for your in depth review!",

Decided to get my sh\\*t together and change my lifestyle, and feel like I'm on the right track again.\n\nAs for the workout routine I mostly did calisthenics at home: every day 3-4 sets of pullups, push ups, dips and stacked books inside a box for curls (lol) until I could afford to buy a gym membership plan yesterday, going for a full body workout for a week or two then probably going to be on PPL as it has worked great for me before. Note, a portion of the weight gained was most likely water weight.\n\nDiet: (am lactose intolerant so try to keep dairy free)\n\nMorning: 2 eggs1 cup rice sesame oil\n\nLunch: chicken breast 1 cup rice protein shake consisting of: oats, whey isolate, creatine, 2 tbsp peanut butter, 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 cup soy milk, water, frozen berries, banana\n\nDinner: Beef mince Sweet potato's frozen vegetables\n\nAnd whatever snacks I could force feed myself in between and at night, usually consisting of: potato chips, roasted unsalted almonds and whatever takeaways I was feeling to get the calories in. During the 1st week I loaded on creatine at 20g/day then 5g afterwards.\n\noverall daily calories added to at least 3000/day. Back when I was 48kg I would eat 1 meal a day.\n\nI will admit I did smoke a bit of weed during this time to force feed myself more and get the calories (but trying to be careful as to not rely on it), and can honestly say my appetite has increased a ton after my body adjusted to the drastic increase in calorie intake. I'm well aware keeping this rate of weight gain is not sustainable, but proud with the progress in size and slowing down the weight gain as to not gain much more fat.\n\nStill have a long way to go, but I hope this inspires one of you readers that no matter the obstacles in life, you can always bounce back.

    "body": "Hey everyone, axcho of [Super Body Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/) (and previously, [Custom Body Fuel](http://custombodyfuel.com/blog/)) here. :)\n\nAs contemplated and discussed in [my previous post a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/rinw75/should_we_add_glycine_to_super_body_fuel_what/), we've successfully rolled out the latest update to our formulas: an extra **2g glycine** added per meal to target a 4:1 ratio of glycine to methionine, plus **1g beetroot powder** added to every meal of the strawberry flavors, to boost flavor, color, and nutritional benefits! Sweet! :D\n\nHere's [the email](https://superbodyfuel.com/blog/may-2022-update/) we just sent out:\n\n>Hi everyone,  \n>  \n>Just a quick update to let you all know that [all of our recipes](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/) have been **updated to include the amino acid glycine**, yay! :D That includes [Milk Fuel](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/milk-fuel/) and [Super Protein](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-protein/), by the way. :d  \n>  \n>You can read more in the last couple email updates from February, archived on [the blog](https://superbodyfuel.com/blog/). But long story short, *glycine* is one of those “nonessential” amino acids that arguably people don’t get enough of, these days.  \n>  \n>In order to target a 4:1 ratio of glycine to methionine, **we have started adding 2g of vegan-friendly, sweet-tasting glycine powder to every Super Body Fuel meal** in order to balance out the high methionine content of rice protein (and dairy protein, for that matter).  \n>  \n>Nothing weird about this – it’s analogous to how we’ve been adding lysine since rice protein is low in that. With sufficient glycine, your body (and mind) will thank you, with reduced inflammation and a more relaxed mood, among other benefits – according to [the studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5350494/). :)  \n>  \n>Personally, I’ve been adding glycine to my [Super Fuel](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fuel/) and [Keto Fuel](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) for months – and now, I won’t have to! :D Awesome!  \n>  \n>All the old inventory has turned over, so with the exception of a few samples (that will be gone soon) anything you order will have the new glycine-enhanced formula.  \n>  \n>If you’ve already got the new glycine version (check the Ingredients list!) let us know what you think of the taste! :) Glycine adds a subtle sweetness that has allowed us to very slightly dial back the monkfruit sweetener, so the overall effect may be a bit different. My impression is that the overall sweetness is down about half a perceptible notch – which may be a good thing, as we sometimes get feedback from longtime customers that it would be better if the sweetness were slightly toned down. **But what do you think? Please,** ***please*** **let us know!** :D We want to get it *just* right.  \n>  \n>At the same time, based on the overwhelmingly positive feedback on our beetroot survey in the last email, **we’ve added 1g of beetroot powder to every meal of our strawberry flavor**, for an enhanced taste, color, and nutritional profile (*betaine* and nitric oxide and such). And before you ask, net carbs for the keto version remain the same. ;)  \n>  \n>Again, please let us know what you think of the updated flavor! We hope you like it better, but do let us know. :o All the strawberry samples have switched over to the new version, with both glycine and beetroot added.  \n>  \n>Initially, I’d hoped that the glycine powder would “pay for itself” in effect by reducing the amount of expensive monkfruit sweetener we’d need to add. But it turns out that we’re only able to reduce the monkfruit very slightly, if at all (*you* tell *us*!) and now, **the price of glycine has gone up significantly!** :o Bad timing, I know.  \n>  \n>Still, we are committed to keeping our prices low and affordable, and I believe in the value of this glycine addition in making our formula the best that it can be, so **we’re holding steady for now.** Please let us know if you think it’s been worth it – your feedback is the main thing that steers this ship. :)  \n>  \n>**I** ***will*** **say that this year is when world events are finally catching up with us at Super Body Fuel.** :/ Our costs for ingredients and shipping have gone up significantly in the past several months, on top of the cost-of-living adjustments we’ve already had to make for the whole team to keep up with inflation in the beginning of this year. At the same time, the number of orders we are getting each month has been declining to a level that is lower than it’s been for years.  \n>  \n>The bottom line is, **this year is the first time that the business has been losing money month over month since we started operations.** *Don’t panic!* ;p This is not an emergency, or a cry for help, as we have savings to weather this downturn – for the year, at least. And we (still) have the rebrand coming up, hopefully very soon. But this is a new thing for us. And I want to be transparent about that.  \n>  \n>I have no intention of raising prices, as I know we could pull out of this just as easily by increasing monthly orders beyond a certain threshold, and I’m stubborn. But if you appreciate us holding prices steady when everyone else seems to be raising them, maybe let us know that – with your words *or* with your dollars. ;)  \n>  \n>Thanks everyone. Let’s all hang in there. <3  \n>  \n>Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)\n\n**Feel free to weigh in about the price changes (or lack thereof) here, as well as any thoughts about** ***glycine*** **or** ***beetroot!*** Or the prebiotic fiber *inulin*, which so far didn't make the cut, as it's more controversial and may cause digestive problems for some people. We're still running experiments with our brave volunteers though. ;)\n\nThank you! :)",

All ingredient data comes from Amazon.com or Makeup Alley, so it might be imperfect.\n\n*My questions for you:* Are any of these ingredients especially noteworthy? Do you think there are any functional differences between the masks?\n\n*Observations:* The top 5 ingredients in all of the masks are nearly identical, although they appear in different orders on the list, indicating that there may be more or less of them in different masks. They are: **Purified water, Glycerin(e), 1,3-Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Gel/Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice/Aloe Extract.** (Not sure of the differences between the aloe ingredients, I'm counting them as one item for the purposes of this comparison.)\n\nA few masks had a unique item in their top 5 ingredients.

They started in 2003, but they have only released masks so far. There have been many other brands that have made it in and out of Taiwan since then, like Naruko for those looking for targeted treatments and White Essence with lotions more advanced than Hada Labo. \n\nThere are many other sheet masks ranges in Taiwan, and they have to be good enough to retain market share against market leader MBD.

I started out as [a DIYer](https://diy.soylent.com/users/axcho) and started selling my own mixes, first on the [Soylent forum](https://discourse.soylent.com/t/anyone-selling-their-diy/12910/2?u=axcho), then at [Custom Body Fuel](http://custombodyfuel.com/blog/), and now at actual real company [Super Body Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/).\n\nOne of the advantages of having a real business is that I can get ingredients that are not available to consumers on Amazon and elsewhere, like 97% pure stevia powder with a much reduced aftertaste (versus the 90% you normally see), and soon, a custom vitamin powder with the optimal chemical forms and amounts of each micronutrient. The disadvantage, is that I have to buy really large amounts of them. That's not necessarily a problem, but Super Body Fuel is a very small operation and we don't go through these ingredients very quickly.\n\nFor example, the quotes I've gotten from manufacturers on the vitamin powder so far are about $100/kg for a minimum order of 100kg. That's not bad if you look at it as $0.10/g, but the total is $10,000. That's a lot of money. And it will take *years* for us to use that up, at our current rate. We literally would not be able to use it all before the powder reaches its expiration date.\n\nSo I was thinking, why not feed two birds with one scone? **Why not sell our unique ingredients, like 97% stevia and our upcoming custom vitamin powder, to DIYers in addition to selling our [usual products](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/)?**\n\nIt just depends on demand. Would *you* be interested in buying our vitamin powder for use in your DIY?\n\nA while back I [puzzled over](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/3irk13/amazon_links_for_super_body_fuel_diy_recipes/) the problem of how to put Super Body Fuel's recipes on the DIY site when many of our ingredients are not available to consumers. What would be the point if people couldn't actually make it themselves?\n\nBut if we sell those ingredients ourselves, it makes complete sense. In fact, then we'd be able to profit a little from DIYers as well as our usual customers.\n\nSo what do you think? Would you want this? Do you know people who would?\n\nHere are some of the ingredients we could sell:\n\n* **Super Body Fuel's upcoming custom vitamin and mineral powder** - Already a powder, so no need for grinding tablets or uncapping capsules. Also, probably the highest quality multivitamin you can buy, at DIY-friendly prices.\n* **Stevia Extract (97% RebA)** - Natural non-caloric sweetener with way less of the burnt-leaf aftertaste of most of the stevia on the market. Match the sweetness of our recipes with no trial and error.\n* **Magnesium Citrate (20% Mg)** - Higher concentration than most magnesium. We could probably sell it a bit cheaper too.\n* **Ortiva Organic Rice Protein** - Smooth, mild-flavored rice protein. We could sell it cheaper in bulk.\n* **Chicory Root Inulin** - Prebiotic fiber with a smooth texture and slightly sweet taste. We could sell it cheaper in bulk.\n\nAny of those look good? Let us know what you think! :)\n\n---\n\nOh, forgot to mention earlier - we have discounted monthly *subscriptions* now, check 'em out on the [Shop](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/)! ;)",

Would you offer different options, or just one blend?\n\nFinally, I am hoping you include a 'bit extra' of some vitamins that people seem to have trouble with.

This is a similar issue with vitamin D.  The current 600 IU recommendation is pretty low considering what recent research has shown.

    "body": "Hey everyone, axcho of [Super Body Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/) (and previously, [Custom Body Fuel](http://custombodyfuel.com/blog/)) here.\n\nNow that we've started getting [Super Micros](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/5rcols/super_micros_now_available_super_body_fuels/) into the hands of DIYers and solved the odor issues (goodbye L-Selenomethionine!), I've been thinking about some changes for the next version.\n\nOne reason is simple - **the FDA's new [2018 Daily Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake#Food_labeling_reference_tables) are almost upon us**, and they've reduced the amounts of certain vitamins and minerals (while increasing others) such that some amounts in our current formula look alarmingly high by the new standards (1000% DV Biotin, anyone?). So for the sake of appearances and politics, we might as well tweak the amounts slightly to keep looking pretty. :p\n\nBut more interestingly, I'm also looking at **removing Folic Acid completely** for the sake of the sizable fraction of the population with a [MTHFR mutation](https://www.dietvsdisease.org/mthfr-mutation-symptoms-and-diet/) that prevents them from metabolizing it properly. Previously, I had included a mix of Folic Acid and the active (methylated) form, L-Methylfolate, as a nod to this condition, but I've since been asked to remove Folic Acid entirely (and replace it with L-Methylfolate), because any amount in the diet of a susceptible person can build up to harmful levels in the body.\n\n**So I thought I'd take this opportunity to upgrade all the B vitamins** to the fancier, active forms, like Riboflavin 5-Phosphate instead of boring old Riboflavin, and Methylcobalamin instead of Cyanocobalamin (in addition to L-Methylfolate replacing Folic Acid). ;p Some B vitamins don't seem to have fancy, active forms (Niacinamide, for example) but take a look and let me know what you think. I've *highlighted* the names of the nutrients that I'm shifting the composition of.\n\n**So here's the proposed spec for the next version** - take a look:\n*(and compare with the old version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/4gx8bb/full_details_on_upcoming_micronutrient_mix_from/))*\n\nNutrient | Amount | Unit | Form | % DV (2018) | Highest RDA of DRI \n----------|----------|------|-------|--------|-----------------------\nVitamin A | 900 | mcg | ~~Retinyl Palmitate~~ *Retinyl Acetate* | 100% | 900 mcg\nVitamin A | ~~900~~ 2700 | mcg | Beta Carotene | ~~100%~~ 300% | 1800 mcg\nVitamin C | 360 | mg | Ascorbic Acid | 400% | 90 mg\nIron | 8 | mg | Ferrous Gluconate | 44% | 18 mg\nVitamin D | 80 | mcg | Ergocalciferol | 400% | 15 mcg\nVitamin E | 30 | mg | *Mixed Tocopherols* | 200% | 30 mg\nVitamin K | ~~160~~ 120 | mcg | Phytonadione | ~~133%~~ 100% | 120 mcg\nVitamin K | ~~0~~ 60 | mcg | *Menaquinone-4* | ~~67%~~ 50% | 120 mcg\nVitamin K | ~~80~~ 60 | mcg | Menaquinone-7 | ~~67%~~ 50% | 120 mcg\nThiamin | 2.4 | mg | *Thiamine Cocarboxylase* | 200% | 1.2 mg\nRiboflavin | 2.6 | mg | *Riboflavin 5-Phosphate* | 200% | 1.3 mg\nNiacin | 16 | mg | Niacinamide | 100% | 16 mg\nVitamin B6 | 3.4 | mg | *Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate* | 200% | 1.7 mg\nFolate | 400 | mcg | *L-Methylfolate* | 100% | 400 mcg\nVitamin B12 | 9.6 | mcg | *Methylcobalamin* | 400% | 2.4 mcg\nBiotin | 120 | mcg | D-Biotin | 400% | 30 mcg\nPantothenic Acid | 20 | mg | D-Calcium Pantothenate | 400% | 5 mg\nIodine | 180 | mcg | Potassium Iodide | 120% | 150 mcg\nZinc | 11 | mg | Zinc Glycinate | 100% | 11 mg\nSelenium | 220 | mcg | Selenium Glycinate | 400% | 55 mcg\nCopper | 1.8 | mg | Copper Glycinate | 200% | 0.9 mg\nChromium | 140 | mcg | Chromium Picolinate | 400% | 35 mcg\nMolybdenum | 45 | mcg | Molybdenum Glycinate | 100% | 45 mcg\nCholine | 550 | mg | Choline L-Bitartrate | 100% | 550 mg\nBoron | ~~1~~ 3 | mg | Boron Glycinate | * | *\n\n**Daily serving size: 4g** (~1.5g xanthan gum + ~1.5g choline bitartrate + ~1g everything else)\n\nAs mentioned in previous posts about this vitamin mix...\n\n> Boron is a trace element that does not have an established recommended intake. However, it is involved in bone formation, and it's easy and safe to supplement, so we might as well include it just to be safe.\n> \n> Nickel, silicon, and vanadium are also trace elements without an established recommended intake, but they are present in sufficient amounts in brown rice and oats (which [our products](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/) at Super Body Fuel are based on) so there's no need to supplement in our premix.\n> \n> Manganese and phosphorus are both present in significant amounts in both rice protein and oat flour, so we won't supplement them either.\n> \n> Iron is present in significant amounts in rice protein and oat flour as well, but not enough to meet 100% DV, and additionally the bioavailability of grain-based iron is quite low. So we will partially supplement.\n> \n> We add our electrolytes separately, since they are bulky and vary from product to product, so they're not included in this premix. So if you're wondering about potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium, that's why they're not included in the spec.\n\nI haven't yet checked with our current manufacturer about the availability of all these ingredients, or how much they'll increase the price, but my hope is that we'll continue to be able to make it available at $0.25-0.50 a day as [Super Micros](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-micros/).\n\n---\n\n**Also!** We're getting close to finalizing our electrolyte mix, so you can look forward to getting your hands on a **Super Electrolytes** (Super Electros? Super Lytes?) soon as well! ;D\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think of the proposed changes to Super Micros! Especially curious if anyone has experience with the different B vitamins and potentially, MTHFR as well.\n\nThanks! :)",

Currently, the 45 micrograms in the new proposed mix falls slightly short of the 50 microgram EU RDA.\n\nAlso it may be an idea to reconsider vitamin A and vitamin D. Unless my calculations are incorrect, 900mcg of retinyl palmitate plus 900mcg of beta carotene is equal to 4500 I.U. whilst 80mcg of ergocalciferol is equal to 3200 I.U.\n\nThe Perfect Health Diet estimates the optimal vitamin A to vitamin D ratio, when both are taken in I.U., to be 2.5:1, though I've seen as low as 2:1 recommended. Currently this change makes it 1.40625:1. By changing to the previous recipe for vitamin A (900mcg retinyl palmitate, 1800mcg beta carotene), this becomes a much closer 1.875:1, which is pretty close to that ratio.\n\nAlso, I meant to mention it to you before, but I'd like to see the boron content increased quite substantially to 6mg. The reason for this is from [this article](https://examine.com/supplements/boron/), specifically the osteoarthritis section, which says:\n\n\"It has been hypothesized that 6mg daily Boron (tetraborate) could alleviate inflammation of the joints,[23] which was followed by a pilot study in 20 patients with confirmed osteoarthritis showed 50% response (half of patients reporting benefit) with 55mg Sodium tetraborate decahydrate (6mg elemental Boron) suggesting some possible benefit to osteoarthritis.[24] This may be related to the observation that the bone and synovial fluid of arthritic persons is less than healthy controls.[23]\"\n\n23: Newnham RE\t[Essentiality of boron for healthy bones and joints](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7889887) . Environ Health Perspect. (1994)\n\n24: [Boron and Arthritis: The Results of a Double-blind Pilot Study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13590849009003147)\n\nObviously these studies have been done on those already afflicted with a medical condition, but I like to take somewhat preventative measures, and as boron is fairly cheap to include and has an upper tolerable limit of 20mg, it could be worthwhile increasing the amount up to the 6mg mentioned in the studies.\n\nMore information about the ratio of the tocopherols would also be good if you happen to have it available.",

        "body": "Looks like plenty of good feedback so far, so I will just throw in thoughts about a vitamin dear to my heart, B12.  You might take a look at [this page](http://www.veganhealth.org/b12/noncyanob12) discussing methyl vs cyano B12 and potential bio-availability of both.  I am personally on the fence with this issue.  Cbl has much more research behind it regarding effectiveness and absorption, whereas MeCbl is much less studied, but a non-cyanide form of the vitamin would theoretically be preferred assuming absorption rates are decent.\n\nFirst, let's try to find out what good values are for serum B12.  I will link to [this recent article](https://chriskresser.com/why-b12-deficiency-is-significantly-underdiagnosed/) by Kresser, where he mentions:\n\n>Conventional ranges are typically designed to detect frank disease rather than an optimal level, and serum B12 and even homocysteine are no exception. Most labs define B12 deficiency at less than 200 pg/mL, but it is well documented in the scientific literature that many people experience signs and symptoms of B12 deficiency at levels between 200 and 350. In Japan and Europe, I believe the lower end of the range is 400 and up or even 500 and up in either Japan or Europe. I can’t recall. And so, if you get the B12 tests back and the level is 300, it’s going to be marked as normal, but at that level there’s a really good chance that you are in the earlier stages of B12 deficiency....\n\nSo thinking about those potential 'zones' for deficiency and/or insufficiency, let's look at some studies.\n\n\n[This paper](http://www.nature.com.secure.sci-hub.bz/ejcn/journal/v69/n1/full/ejcn2014165a.html) recommends a combination of B12 forms to obtain optimal results.\n\n**For the MeCbl studies:**\n\n[This n=19 study](https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/read-the-journal/all-issues/2010-2019/2016/vol-129-no-1436-10-june-2016/6920) gave 1000 mcg MeCbl orally daily for 6 months and only raised serum B12 from 170 to 260.\n\n[This n=30 study](http://link.springer.com.secure.sci-hub.bz/article/10.1245%2Fs10434-011-1764-6) gave 1500 mcg MeCbl orally daily for 12 weeks and raised serum B12 from 170 to 810.\n\n[This n=16 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039999/) gave 1000 mcg MeCbl orally daily for 12 weeks and raised serum B12 from 779 to 1183.\n\n[This n=33 study](http://www.karger.com.secure.sci-hub.bz/Article/Abstract/57605) gave 500 mcg MeCbl orally twice weekly for 4 months to two groups and raised serum B12 from 2.35 to 23.5 and 1.69 to 17.4 (pg/L units).  However, the authors also stated:\n\n>With respect to the sole administration of Me-Cbl,\nalbeit vitamin B12 is important as a cofactor in Hcy\nmetabolism, we were unable to demonstrate its capability\nto significantly diminish tHcy levels when it was prescribed\neither alone or in combination with FA (folic acid), despite\nthe remarkable high levels of vitamin B12 achieved. This\nmay be due to the fact that both cofactors must be present\nfor a correct performance of methionine synthase.\n\nMy note: Conversion of homocysteine to methionine is one of the primary beneficial effects of B12 and this commentary indicates that MeCbl might not be very effective at performing this job.\n\n**For the Cbl studies:**\n\n[This n=18 study](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/92/4/1191.long?sso-checked=true) gave 2000 mcg of Cbl orally daily for 6 months and raised serum B12 from 93 to 1005 (100 to 315 for the lowest responder and 30 to 1635 for the highest responder).\n\n[This n=18 study](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\\(99\\)02479-4/fulltext) gave 2000 mcg Cbl orally daily for 2 weeks and raised serum B12 from 128 to 515.\n\n[This n=40 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1742688/pdf/v079p00218.pdf) gave 1000 mcg Cbl orally daily for 6+ months and raised serum B12 from 410 to 1164.\n\n[This n=10 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964566/pdf/main.pdf) gave 1000 mcg Cbl orally daily for 3 months and raised serum B12 from 106 to 223 (60 to 120 for the lowest responder and 97 to 230 for the highest responder).\n\n[This review paper](http://www.tandfonline.com.sci-hub.bz/doi/abs/10.1517/14656560903456053?journalCode=ieop20) compared multiple Cbl studies and conclude that:\n\n>...our experience and the present analysis support the use of oral cobalamin therapy in clinical practice. We recommend a dose of 1000 µg/day of oral cyanocobalamin for life in the case of pernicious anemia (Table 3). In the case of intake deficiency or food-cobalamin malabsorption, we recommend 1000 µg/day of oral cyanocobalamin for 1 month and then 125 – 1000 µg/day, until the cobalamin deficiency cause is corrected.\n\nNow, what all of this means for your supplement, I am unsure.  Many of these studies are done with high doses of B12 in order to quickly correct obvious deficiencies.  There are also considerations for smokers who might not handle Cbl that well, or those with absorption issues that might need much higher doses than the RDA.  My current strategy (as a vegan) is to take alternating days of 1000 mcg MeCbl and 500 mcg Cbl (the 500 being partly due to the fact that my iron supplement has 500 mcg Cbl integrated with it).  If it's not cost-prohibitive, I would personally keep both forms in your supplement mix, one 'lower' dose of Cbl and one higher dose of MeCbl, although the exact dosing I am uncertain of.",

This is just reference for you guys! :)\n\nMost hair needs some amount of protein, especially damaged(sun, wind, heat, bleach, etc) hair. Normal hair, or protein sensitive hair does not need large doses of protein all the time. If your hair feels stiff, frizzy, and dry, then your hair might be getting to much protein.  \n\nFor some fine/damaged curlies, protein will make your curls spring to life like never before!! Careful- It can be addicting and turn into a case of \"too much of a good thing\".  Don't worry- if you go overboard on protein treatments, you can just do a good deep conditioning treatment to help counteract the protein overload. :)  So if you have damaged hair that needs protein, how often should you do it?  If it's an INTENSE level of protein, once a week. If it's a conditioner that has some protein in it, every other day or even every day(if it's low enough on the ingredient list) will be fine.  This is why hair porosity is important: Low porosities probably do not need any protein, normal could use some protein, but high porosity LOVES protein. :)\n\nOKAY. Here's the list of commonly used proteins.

    "body": "So here's the process:\n\nI was overweight, with a BMI of around 28.5kg/m² for a long time (now I'm between 21 and 22)\n\nI used to eat something sweet while heading to work, eat lunch early, then eat some samosa or ice cream at 4:30, then a snack like chips or cheese while returning.\n\nIn September - October I was dating a girl who said if I want her to fantasize about me, I should get in shape.\n\nThat was a trigger for me. I started working out, genuinely to become hotter for her as I cared about her or perhaps to show her that I can do it. Idk.\n\nIt was perhaps her pheromones which gave me a testosterone boost, I don't know what exactly helped me get started.\n\nI hated my condition. For 1.5 years I didn't take a single photograph of myself except to document how fat I had become.\n\nI had started to think that I was going to remain fat or keep gaining fat and I'll be very ugly when I'm 35.\n\nSo in the last week of October I started running. Just for 5-7 minutes on a treadmill everyday.\n\nWhen November came around, I did 5 things:\n1) A cutting diet.\n2) Vegan diet.\n3) No Nut November (stopped after November).\n4) Sleep early, at 10PM.\n5) Stopped eating anything with sugar.\n\nI also weigh myself everyday and input the data into an app (Weightfit). I am doing that even in maintenance. You should as well.\n\nI started losing weight and that kept me motivated.\n\nMore importantly I did my research.\n\nI recommend reading Stronger by Science's diet article (Google that and you'd find it).\n\nCalculate your Total Daily Calorie Expenditure and keep a deficit.\n\nI was able to keep a large deficit and maintain it.\n\nI would wake up between 5-6 automatically.\nI would go exercise at 7. \n\nInitially it was just running for 5-10 minutes and nothing else, but slowly slowly I started doing more exercises on my own one by one. I used to be fit so I knew exercises.\n\nAt a point I was working out for 1-2 hours every morning, it is 2 hours often.\n\nIt's important to understand the glycogen reserves, insulin and fat release to lose weight.\n\nAfter the workout I would drink protein shake, I took 4/3rds of a serving as pea+rice protein is a little bit less bioavailable.\n\nAfter that I would go to work and only eat 1 chapati and some bhaji (sabji/vegetables) for lunch.\n\nAt 5PM another protein shake (currently I'm drinking pea+rice in the morning and soy in the evening)\n\nHave dinner at 7-8 which was daal rice, maybe 2-3 katori rice.\n\nEnsure that you're getting micronutrients.\n\nPeanuts once in a while for fats, the bhaji also had oil. \n\nCOUNT EVERY CALORIE. Google calories in anything before eating, check a few websites to confirm.\n\nWithout calculating TDEE and counting every calorie, you won't lose weight.\n\nMy workout is pretty specific so I don't see a point in sharing, but I strongly recommend running 1.5km everyday. In my opinion it helped me not snack and manage my cravings easily.\n\nI have never had a drink nor do I smoke. I also don't drink tea or coffee, never have.\n\n\nPasted beneath is the text I once posted in my WhatsApp statuses.\n\nMy transformation from fat to in good shape is inspiring and all\n\nBUT, you should know the following:\n\n1) I have been working out since I was 17. Not regularly, but yeah. I was in good shape before I gained that weight. I wasn't clueless about exercise, though I was clueless about the science of calories and protein etc. So the muscle and coordination you may see now is regained, not grown from scratch (edit: now I'm growing new muscle)\n\n2) I checked my Testosterone levels yesterday, they are high, I'm estimating over 850 ng/dL at maximum (the total was 764 at noon, no exercise). It's all natural, no supplements as such, I didn't even try to increase it.\nIt may have increased a lot since I began working out, dieting, sleeping on time etc. \n\nThis means that it's particularly possible for me to cut very aggressively. I don't even tell people how many calories I ate everyday while cutting because it's low. I burn fat faster. T also helped me gain back the atrophied muscle volume quickly.\n\n3) My job is not very stressful and my commute time is 5 minutes one way. \n\nI am sharing these things because people keep praising my dedication and discipline etc\n\nAnd additionally so that people don't try to cut as aggressively as me.\n\nBut I will reiterate, do the following things to see great results (based on scientific research I've come across):\n\n1) Create a schedule and stick to it religiously. I slept at 10:30PM on 31st December, it's not impossible, choose to do it.\n\n2) Sleep and wake up at the same time everyday, even on weekends. \nWake up naturally at sunrise everyday if you live in the tropical latitudes (so yes in India). ➡️\n\n3) Diet is very important. If possible buy a kitchen scale and ensure that you get at least 50g protein everyday (ideally 0.8g per kg of body weight, at least 1.0 if you're cutting), that's just the minimum. \nCut out sugar entirely, it ages us. \nQuit alcohol and smoking.\nTry to eat only whole foods, no processed packaged food unless necessary like protein powder. Don't \"cheat\" unless you need a self-love day.\nPersonal, but go vegan. You actually don't need to rape or kill animals for the gains. It's also good for lowering cholesterol, getting better skin and cutting calories.\n\n5) Check for deficiencies. Check your general vitals.\nVit D deficiency is very common, even I have a history of it. It's very important in many places.\n\nStudy and research everything. This is very important. Don't listen to gym bro advices, there's a lot of misinformation floating around.\nI recommend: Institute of Human Anatomy for physiology (they make videos on exercise), Matt Walker for sleep, CalisthenicsMovement for exercise. I have saved a few links, ask me for them.\n\n4) Exercise. I prefer exercise in the morning. I also prefer bodyweight and outdoor exercise over gyms.\n\nRun at least a kilometre everyday. \nStay away from the machines at the gym (they're only to be used in case you're recovering from injuries), stick to bodyweight and free-weights.\n\nDon't try to do a million exercises when getting started. Just start with perfecting one or two compound exercises like push ups. Start low, take it slow.\n\nI eat pea and rice protein powder by MyPro (tried MyHerb but didn't feel great about it, may have been other factors, I'll try Nutrabay pea and rice protein and soy protein as well).\n\nYou don't get acne or bloating from vegan protein powder and it doesn't cost more. The one above is ₹1400 per kg, but I eat 1kg everyday 12.5 days.\n\nIt's perfectly safe to drink two servings everyday (recommended on the box).\n\nThere's a misconception that veganism is expensive.\nTofu is ₹55 per 250g while paneer is ₹95 per 200g.\nProtein powder costs are similar (depends on the brand).\nSoyabean and soya chunks are also cheap (it does *not* feminise you).\nThe only expensive thing is soya milk which costs ₹100-₹150 per litre as compared to bovine milk which costs ₹70-₹100. But you don't need to drink soya milk everyday!\n\nAssuming 89% bioavailability for pea protein, I'm eating about 50g protein or 88g powder everyday.\nAdditionally I eat lentils, soyabean (beans or chunks, prefer the former), tofu, chhole, harbhara, moog daal etc in meals for an additional 20g; and chapatis and rice add 10-15 more. \n\nYes, eating 100g of soyabean, which turns into 200g after cooking can be difficult. \nIt gives you 35g protein. But if you don't make it spicy, it's not that difficult. The fiber is good too.\n\nI dissolve CaO (chuna) in water used for protein shakes for Calcium.\n₹5 chuna dabi lasts for 4 months (but I think I'm undereating)\n\nB12 supplements should cost you ₹8 per month and they even have other vitamins and folic acid etc\n\nActually gym bros can be really well versed in these matters, there is certainly misinformation floating around in gyms as well and steroid users don't really need to research much\n\nMore misinformation is observed in the general public. People think you lose weight by eating more protein. People think that jaggery is good for you if sugar is bad. They think bodybuilding on plants is impossible (the amino acids are the same y'all).\n\nThe things I said about my unique condition:\n\nIt's just to tell you to be patient and cut at a rate you can manage.\n\nYou will definitely see results in just a few weeks and then you'll be hooked.\n\n",

    "body": "Hey everyone, axcho from [Super Body Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/) here. :) I just sent this email update out to our customers last week, so I thought I'd give you all a heads up about it too:\n\n> Hi everyone,\n> \n> Happy summer! :) In honor of the summer solstice, the official start of summer, we have a new subscriptions sale for you, as well as a few other announcements:\n> \n> * **Reduced prices**: subscriptions now 20% off instead of 10% off!\n> * [Super Protein](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-protein/): hypoallergenic, complete protein mix now available.\n> * Global vanilla shortage: vanilla extract replacing vanilla bean powder.\n> * [Schmilk Vanilla](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/schmilk/?flavor=vanilla&size=20): it’s finally here!\n> \n> As you may remember in the beginning of this year, we had a really big sale in January where everything was 20% off or more, right at the point where we’d just about break even. It was a big success in that you all sure bought a lot of stuff (thank you!), but it was also too much for us to handle and we got backlogged for a really long time! :p\n> \n> Fortunately, we caught up with our backlog two months ago, and have been shipping out next-day or close to it ever since then. Things have been so smooth and stable since then that apparently I’m itching to play with fire again and try out another sale! ;) This time we’ll do a smaller sale – we’ll reduce the price of just subscriptions, and reduce them by $5 instead of $10. That means that Athlete Fuel, normally $50, or $45 for a subscription, is now only $40 for a subscription.\n> \n> **However, for [Schmilk](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/schmilk/), we’re going even further.** Just like we’ve subsidized our DIY ingredients and international shipping, offering them at barely breakeven prices while making money on our other products, we’re going to do the same thing with Schmilk. Instead of $30 for Schmilk and $25 for a Schmilk subscription, we’ll be charging $25 for Schmilk and $20 for a Schmilk subscription. We really can’t go any lower than that. But since Schmilk is our low-price option, we really want to make sure it is accessible to everyone, even on a very restrictive budget. So now you can subscribe to a month’s worth of Schmilk for $120, with free shipping, plus up to $60 of whole milk. That’s less than $200 for a month’s worth of complete nutrition. :)\n> \n> **How long will this sale last?** My hope is make these price drops permanent, but at the very least we’ll keep it going to through the end of the month. ;) However, this time, we’ll keep the subscriptions at the sale price even after the sale ends, if it ever does. Only new subscriptions will start at the old price, in that case. So it’s a smaller sale, but it’s a sustained sale. If you secure your subscription now, you’ll have it as long as you want. Oh, and if you already have an existing subscription, we’ll make sure to adjust the price for that too, so you don’t have to do anything. ;)\n> \n> **In other news, we’ve recently added [Super Protein](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-protein/) to our lineup of discounted, high-quality DIY ingredients!** Combine it with [Super Fiber](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fiber/), [Super Electrolytes](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-electrolytes/), and [Super Micros](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-micros/), and you get, essentially [Keto Fuel Plain](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/?flavor=plain). Or just use it on its own as a hypoallergenic, vegan protein powder with a balanced amino acid profile, that also has a reasonably good taste and texture.\n> \n> We’re able to sell it for $3 a day (at 100g protein per day) which is competitive with the majority of organic rice protein powder on the market. But ours has added Lysine to balance out the amino acid profile, as well as Cellulose for insoluble fiber to prevent constipation, and a little Xanthan Gum to improve the texture and stability. And we source from a specific manufacturer whose organic rice protein has a much better taste and texture than comparable brands, while also being low in heavy metals. :)\n> \n> **We’ve also, at long last, made [Schmilk Vanilla](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/schmilk/?flavor=vanilla&size=20) available to order!** :) Ironically, this is also when we ran out of our vanilla bean powder, and our supplier actually did not have any more, thanks to the global vanilla bean shortage that has been going on for the past couple years! Fortunately, we were able to find a vanilla extract, made from real vanilla beans, that is on a fructose-free carrier (dextrose, which is essentially just glucose) instead of the sugar-based carrier we had found in the past, so our products are still low-FODMAP friendly even with this change. :D\n> \n> So far people actually seem to like the taste of the vanilla extract version better, though it’s very subjective (and you don’t get those fancy black vanilla bean specks in the mix anymore!). Let us know what you think – we’re really curious how the new vanilla compares! :)\n> \n> Speaking of taste, we’ve also updated our labels and our FAQ to recommend **avocado oil** as the best oil to use for Super Fuel and Keto Fuel, instead of olive oil. I’ve been testing out a bunch of different oils, and avocado oil not only rivals extra virgin olive oil as the healthiest (same lipid profile and more vitamins, but fewer antioxidants), it also tastes the best! Of course, it’s not always as easy to find, and it can be expensive, so we’re also recommending **olive oil**, **high-oleic sunflower oil**, and even **canola oil** as cheaper alternatives, in descending order of price… and quality! :p Say what you will about canola oil, but it’s definitely the least worst of the cheap oils – way better than soybean oil or corn oil.\n> \n> Oh, and in case you’re wondering why you’re not seeing subscriptions on the [Super Body Fuel shop page](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/) anymore, I found a plugin that finally lets us combine one-time and subscription purchases onto the same product page! :D The old subscription product pages are still there, but they’re not featured anymore because they’re not necessary. Hope you like the new look. ;)\n> \n> Thanks again, and enjoy the summer! :D\n> \n> Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)",

Most vegetables seem okay in moderation and depending on their impact on the total ratio. Silken tofu seems like a decent option, TVP, macadamia and other nuts, avocados, does that sound about right?\n\nYummly has been suggested as a source of recipes etc, and this post seems to have a few usable recipes too:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarianketo/comments/pwhvq/vegan_lowcarb_deliciousness_recipes_in_comments/\n\nAny advice?

        "body": "It's definitely doable! Granted it is a hell of a lot harder than being vegan. Been doing vegan \"keto\" (I try to stick to the keto macros, but most days my carbs tend to wind up somewhere around 20-30g a day), with mixed results. Doing keto I have lost 15 pounds, after 6 months of sticking to a 1200 calorie/day diet, working out 6 days a week, and not losing a damn pound. Although for all of August I've been plateaued and can't break out of it. I really should start working out again, maybe that will help. I do feel a lot healthier overall, and have a ton more energy. Anyway enough about me, here's some things I learned:\n \n* Chia seeds are great for everything! Ground up, with added water they work really well as an egg replacer.  Also great whole with some almond milk, peanut butter, vanilla and truvia (or whatever sweetener you'd like), as a dessert. \n\n* If you eat fake meats/cheese. Gardein is the best, and generally low carb. Follow Your Heart is the only vegan cheese I have found that's actually low carb. Also Tofurkey anything. \n\n* Stock up on TVP/tofu. \n\n* I found I can generally \"veganize\" most keto recipes using the vegan equivalent.  \n* Nuts....so many nuts.\n* Favorite veggies: spinach, broccoli, cauliflower(you can turn this into so many different things), green peppers, mushrooms, lettuce, avocado, dried chopped onions in place of raw onions in cooking, kale (chips or in stir fry. Although a little on the carby side), celery (with PB), and brussel sprouts \n* Veganaise. Also if you like that type of thing. \n* I really love the tofu shiratake noodles in stir frys and Asian dishes, but most people hate them. Try rising multiple times, and cooking in microwave for about a minute. They are **horrible** with tomato sauce though.  \n* Get used to checking nutritional labels again hah \n* You're right about the True Nutrition protein powder. LOVE that stuff, so far I've tried the Birthday Cake, and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and I loved both! That reminds me, must stock up again.\n* Been on a low carb pancake kick. Made with ground up chia seed egg replacer. I was bored or flaw cereal, or tvp.\n* Online calorie trackers are lifesavers. I like My Fitness Pal with [this plugin](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/124645)\n\nI do tend to eat a lot of processed foods, though as you can see. I know some people are against that type of thing. I work too much, and have too little time/motivation to cook everything from scratch at the moment. OK, I feel I've rambled on enough. ha Hopefully I helped somewhat, and good luck! Can't wait to see some awesome progress pics!",

Just basically has lost its ability to dissolve in water and is inert and tacky. It's also a darker color and has started forming cracks. \n\nAny suggestions on how to save this?

We won't do anything about it.\n\nEdit: To be clear, the other posts on hard water in this sub are mostly about getting a waxy coating in the hair when using shampoo bars. I do not have this problem.

That's the plan, at least. ;)\n> \n> Thanks to the Super Body Fuel team for keeping this train chugging along so smoothly and getting behind the pumpkin spice crusade with such enthusiasm that I just couldn't come up with any reasons not to make it happen. You all are awesome. :)\n> \n> In other news, **we're rolling out an update to the potassium source in Keto Fuel and Super Fuel**, because just using Potassium Bicarbonate alone makes the drink too alkaline. In order to bring the pH down and make it more neutral (and easier to digest), we're using a combination of Dipotassium Phosphate and Potassium Bicarbonate instead, and replacing the Calcium Phosphate with Calcium Citrate, to keep the phosphorus content from getting out of hand. Specifically, the Dipotassium Phosphate will provide 100% DV of phosphorus, with some additional phosphorus coming from the oat flour or rice protein in the mix.\n> \n> This should not affect the flavor - after a lot of testing, we've found that this is the best combination of potassium sources for flavor neutrality, while most other potassium sources have strong bitter or sour notes. And because it's not so alkaline anymore, it won't pop and fizz with carbonation after you shake it up, and more importantly, you can add berries to it without the acidic juice reacting with the bicarbonate and tasting weird, yay! :D\n> \n> Hmm, perhaps a *real strawberry flavor* could become an option down the road?\n> \n> Well, let's see how things go with the pumpkin spice, first. ;)\n> \n> **Have a great holiday season, everyone.** :) And we're *not* going to do a sale for Black Friday or Cyber Monday or anything like that, so don't wait around for it. Maybe we'll do an anti-sale, where everything costs twice as much. You'd like that, right? ;p\n> \n> Thanks and Thanksgiving to you all! :D\n> \n> Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)\n\n---\n\nSo yeah, I'm super excited to hear what you guys think of the new pumpkin spice flavor - comment or post with your thoughts once you've had a chance to try it! :)\n\nAnd don't buy anything from us on Black Friday - I probably *will* make everything twice as expensive. ;)\n\n---\n\nOn the subject of potassium, by the way... **Anyone want some Potassium Malate?** :p\n\nIt's high-quality stuff, but we've decided not to use it after all, because it's relatively acidic and sour, though not unpleasantly so (not bitter or salty or potassium-y, which is amazing) and we found that sticking with the Phosphate and Bicarbonate worked better for our formula. And now we have a lifetime supply of it, if any DIYers are interested... Let me know! ;D",

    "body": "I’ve gone down a bit of a rabbit hole today. I knew about IGF-1 and that elevating it was considered not good, and I knew that animal products are said to raise IGF-1. Take whey for example: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21590739/\n\nI also discovered that soy protein, when over a certain amount, also increases IGF-1 and perhaps even more so than whey: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28434035/\n\nFrom what I could tell, the mechanisms were to do with the completeness of the amino acid profile of protein source, which is why plant proteins fair much better in regards to the elevation of IGF-1. But Soy, with it having a similar amino acid profile to many animal products raises it similarly to animal products. \n\nThis raised a lot of questions about high protein diets, plant based or otherwise, particularly when I found this study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988204/ It suggests that low protein diets may significantly lower mortality for those under 65, and conversely that high protein diets are associated with disease risk and IGF-1 increase.\n\nWe’ve also known for many years that high intakes of animal protein raises mortality risk: https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/animal-protein-rich-diets-raise-risk-of-death-research-shows-1.2744269\n\nWhat all of this seems to point to is that the higher quality protein we eat, and in larger quantities, increases the risk of mortality by increasing IGF-1.\n\nSo is it really animal proteins that are the issue? I mean, soy elevates it, due to it’s relatively high amino acid profile, so surely highly complete protein blends such as pea and rice protein may do the same?\n\nThen there’s the issue of the soy threshold which is confusing: the researchers suggest that it’s only over 25g per day daily that IGF-1 was moderately raised.\n\nAll of this seems to place weightlifters like me in a pretty bad position. I eat every healthily, or at least I thought I did, but it seems that simply eating a high protein diet (of high quality sources whether they be animal or plant-based) increases IGF-1 and therfore  risk of cancer. \n\nAm I missing something?\n\nMany thanks!",

        "body": "The conclusions from the paper you linked by Valter Longo showing increased mortality in those under 65 should be viewed with great skepticism in my opinion. First of all, they found a *lower* risk of total and cancer mortality in those over 65 who consumed high protein (i.e. the people who are actually dying of age related diseases at high rates). The increased mortality in the younger group is barely statistically significant, so it's probably just a statistical anomaly they conjured up by post-hoc analysis and confirmation bias - and even then the conclusion doesn't make sense since the older group saw the opposite effect.",

        "body": "Hi OP.  Note that we don't allow links to news articles or blog posts so please edit your post to remove that link!  Instead, you can link directly to the study itself, like this:\n\n[Animal and plant protein intake and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: results from two prospective US cohort studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5048552/)\n\nRelating to your question, some early responses will probably involve a discussion about [correlation vs. causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation) and the types of questions that can be answered or not answered with correlative studies.  The study linked above is an example of a correlative study which means they followed a group of people over a long period, asked them about their diets, and then compared the responses and biomarkers of those people with their health outcomes.  However, multiple factors can affect health outcomes so the various differences between people have to be adjusted for ([confounding factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding#Decreasing_the_potential_for_confounding)) and performing adjustments is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the differences between groups.\n\nFor the study you mentioned above, also note that people that ate more animal protein had worse outcomes, but only when they also had at least one other risk factor.  Their substitution analysis also found that not all proteins were equal:\n\n>....we found that the relationship of animal and plant protein with mortality varied by lifestyle factors and any statistically significant protein-mortality associations were restricted to participants with at least one of the unhealthy behaviors, including smoking, heavy alcohol drinking, overweight or obesity, and physical inactivity. Several reasons may explain these findings. First, given the remaining variation of health behaviors across protein intake categories in the unhealthy-lifestyle group, it is possible that residual confounding from lifestyle factors contributes to the observed protein-mortality associations. However, our results are robust to adjustment for a wide spectrum of potential confounders and the propensity score. Second, our results may suggest that the adverse effects of high animal protein intake and beneficial effects of plant protein may be enhanced by other unhealthy lifestyle choices and become evident among the subgroup of individuals with these behaviors who may already have had some underlying inflammatory or metabolic disorders. Finally, as shown in Table 3, with similar amount of intake, participants with and without a healthy lifestyle demonstrated distinct profiles of protein sources. Those with unhealthy lifestyles consumed more processed and unprocessed red meat, whereas the healthy-lifestyle group consumed more fish and chicken as animal protein sources, suggesting that different protein sources, at least partly, contributed to the observed variation in the protein-mortality associations according to lifestyle factors. This hypothesis is supported by our substitution analysis results. Although substituting plants for various animal foods was all associated with a lower mortality, red meat, especially processed red meat, showed a much stronger association than fish and poultry, which themselves were not associated with mortality (eTable 6). In fact, protein from certain fish, such as cod, has been suggested to improve lipid profile, glycemic control and insulin sensitivity.\n\nNow, as far as the IGF1 debate and to what extent animal and plant proteins are harmful vs beneficial in relation to maintaining muscle mass versus promoting unwanted growth such as with cancer, that's a very large topic that is too much for me to begin right now.  For high-level overviews of IGF1, I recommend looking through [these reviews](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=igf-1+%5Bti%5D&filter=pubt.meta-analysis&filter=pubt.review&filter=pubt.systematicreview&filter=years.2011-2021&sort=date&size=50) on PubMed.  [This one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6708115/) covers some basics and discusses the various roles IGF1 can have.\n\nOne last note on the differences between when you measure various biomarkers like IGF1.  Studies will use either a post-prandial (after eating) measurement or a fasting biomarker measurement, or sometimes both.  For an example of how you might account for that, imagine a diet where you increase your intake of proteins and that leads you to losing body fat.  Now, you have raised IGF1 post-prandially but you have lowered IGF1 in the chronic state.  So is your health risk now lower or higher?  Wouldn't it also depend on the amount of 'spike' in your IGF1 levels after eating, and how much your chronic IGF1 has been lowered?  This is just one of the many issues with analyzing and acting on nutritional research but I thought I would provide it as an example.",

Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping.

Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this!

HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "I used to regularly consume a gluten-free pea protein based protein shake as a go-to snack. It was made by Orgain and it was delicious and the protein also made great pancakes. I gave it up at the beginning of the elimination phase because I read that pea protein may or may not be safe depending on how completely it was separated from the carbs. I tried rice protein powder which is supposed to be safer and agree with what I've generally read about it. It tastes like chalk. I can mix a small amount into something like yogurt, but can't drink it. After a few weeks I tried adding back the Orgain because I missed it so much. I probably had too much (it is so good, that when I have one shake I want another). It definitely gave me lots of gas. After some research, I decided to try OWYN. It is also made with pea protein, but I read that it used to be Monash-certified and although they discontinued that, they promise that the recipe hasn't changed. Also, the Orgain contains inulin (which I know can be risky) and the OWYN doesn't, and generally has significantly fewer additives. It was good (not as creamy or yummy as the Orgain) but at least in chocolate tastes fine and it is less tempting to have more than one. The best part, no increase in the amount of gas. I'm using the number of times that I \"pass wind\" a day as my main symptom tracker and it didn't increase at all.",

They are not the same, but I like both of them flavor-wise. The obvious difference when you mix up each shake in the blender bottle is that the Orgain shake is bubbly and frothy and the OWYN isn't bubbly at all. The Orgain definitely has a creamier mouth feel which makes it more tempting to have seconds. Looking at the nutrition label, Orgain has somewhat more fat and almost double the carbs per serving. Given that all FODMAPs are carbs maybe the fact that Orgain gives me gas and OWYN doesn't isn't surprising. Maybe as I do re-introduction I will better understand why. They both have pea protein but perhaps OWYN isolates it from the pea starch more completely. Also, Orgain has inulin which could be part of the problem.",

    "body": "This is a review of Layne's latest video, [Protein: How Much and What Kind Is Best for Healthy Aging | Educational Video | Biolayne](https://youtu.be/ePxCeKXsD44?si=Eh_T0mXljtmz0xGk), which review's this [awesome new paper](https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)66282-3/pdf) which followed a Nurses cohort for 30 years (since 1984).\n\n**MY OWN VIEWS ON THE PAPER**\n\n1. It's a prospective cohort study with 30 years of follow up into the old age - what's not to like? These don't come often.\n2. I think the composite end point to define 'healthy aging' is quite stringent. The people classified as 'healthy agers' have to be all of these 5: a) Alive b) Have none of 11 chronic diseases c) At most 1 memory complaint d) No physical impairment in basic activities e) A low GDS15 score <=1 for mental health.\n\n>\"Healthy aging was defined as a composite end point: being free from 11 major chronic diseases, having no impairment in memory or physical function, and being in good mental health, as defined previously for the NHS participants. All remaining participants were considered to be usual agers, which included those who did not meet our healthy aging definition and those who died before 2016\"\n\nThe problem with this strict definition is that only \\~730 out of 9750 in each protein quintile met the definition. As a result, the rest of the \\~9000, whether dead or if they had 2 memory symptoms instead of 1, are considered the same 'usual ager'. This is problematic, use of a 'healthy aging index score' would have been better, for example. Including All-cause mortality would also have been good, focusing on the people who died (maybe they have other papers on ACM for this cohort).\n\nSo, it's probably better to look at the performance in the individual end-points of chronic disease, memory issues, physical impairment, mental health since it would be slightly less restrictive, but a 'healthy aging index score' would still have been better.\n\n**NORTON'S FACTUAL ERRORS:**\n\n**1. Minor Mistake -** at 2:00, he repeatedly misstates quintiles as quartiles. Also, the highest quintile protein consumption averages 90 grams a day, the lowest averages around 58 grams per day. For old ladies, that is probably around 1.3 gm/kg assuming 70kg weight. Nowhere around 2 gm/kg as pushed by Attia/Norton. This study says nothing about very high protein intakes because lets face it, the real world has very few people consuming 150gm and higher protein, its unnatural.\n\n**2. Major Mistake - at 2:40, he states**\n\n>high protein and a lot of people have made claims that protein could contribute to various diseases like cancer heart disease **I mean this study doesn't really support that because people who were eating higher protein intakes had lower rates of these.**\n\nThis is false. This study shows that higher protein intake and higher animal protein intake has a statistically significant higher risk of chronic diseases.\n\n[Table 3 from the study](https://preview.redd.it/ljimthf5962d1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=794f9f501558b1275a3a0ff7e142df0c1654e0a9)\n\nThe authors of the study write:\n\n>Table 3 presents the associations of dietary protein intake modeled continuously per 3%-energy increment with each domain of healthy aging. **Total and animal protein intake were significantly associated with higher chronic disease risk in all models.** However, dairy protein and plant protein intake were associated with higher odds of absence of chronic diseases. None of the protein intake exposures were associated with the absence of memory complaints after mutual adjustment for plant and animal protein. Animal protein and plant protein were associated with 5% (95% CI: 2%, 9%) and 41% (27%, 57%) higher odds of being free of physical limitations in fully adjusted models, respectively (Table 3). However, only plant protein was significantly associated with higher odds of having good mental status.\n\n**3. At 5:30 onwards he says,**\n\n>again I'm not saying these other things aren't healthy what I'm saying is protein in particular seem to have a beneficial effect on healthy aging when substituted from most of these other nutrients.\n\nHe is looking at Figure 1. This has limitations because as I said above, 'healthy aging' is very restrictive and considers the 'usual agers' as all being the same. Still, does what he say have truth?\n\n[Figure 1 from the study: Odds ratios \\(ORs\\) \\(95&#37; confidence intervals\\) of healthy aging \\(n = 3721\\) associated with isocaloric substitution of protein \\(total, animal, dairy, and plant\\) for dietary carbohydrate \\(total, refined, and from whole grains\\) and dietary fatty acids. The isocaloric substitutions can be interpreted as the effect of substituting 3&#37; of calories contributed by a given dietary protein variable for the corresponding calories contributed by either dietary carbohydrate or dietary fat variables on the odds of healthy aging.](https://preview.redd.it/kzp9t4hc962d1.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a97261df305aeca9aa546f1f918ec1da1c6631)\n\na. If the 95 CI range overlaps 1.00, there is no significance.\n\nb. Substituting Total protein intake is significantly better compared to total carbohydrate, refined carbohydrate, total fat, MUFA intake but similar to carbs from whole grains, SFA, PUFA.\n\nc. Animal protein is only significantly better than MUFA and Total Fat. Same for dairy.\n\nd. Plant protein is significantly better than all compared nutrients since the lower 95 CI is above 1 in all cases.\n\n**Layne lied by omission. It's plant protein that's beneficial compared to others. Not protein in general.**\n\n**4. At 5:49, Norton says**\n\n>when looking at the effects of total protein the odds ratios for every 3% increment of protein intake was was 1.05 which basically means for every 3% increase in total protein intake **there was a 5% increase in the possibility of healthy aging** **meaning that they were free from all these conditions we talked about** .....\n\nHe is looking at Table 2. Yes, the 3700 or so healthy agers are considered with the stringent definition of 'healthy aging', it true that the odds ratio is 1.05 for every 3% increment in protein intake in the final adjustment model (but not the previous models). However, look at the dose dependent trend p-value (in red). These are above 0.05 in many, and change significance depending on what is adjusted. Basically, signal is weak.\n\n[Table 2 from the paper](https://preview.redd.it/r1e584r1962d1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=074b6adbfe1fbe7e70115802bc242aba6d3ae879)\n\nHowever, the bolded part is not true. If you look at non-composite end points from Table 3, 3% higher total protein in the final multivariate model 2 has\n\na) OR 0.95 \\[0.93-0.97\\] for chronic disease which means total protein intake increment is clearly worse. n=15131 reached this endpoint, much more power than the composite end-point which was reached by \\~3700.\n\nb) OR 0.99 \\[0.96-1.01\\] for 'no memory impairment' which is statistically insignificant.  n=23215 reached this endpoint.\n\nc) OR 1.03 \\[0.999-1.07\\] for 'no physical function limitations'. Statistically insignificant but close. n=7303 reached this endpoint.\n\nd) OR 1.01 \\[0.98-1.03\\] for 'good mental health'. Statistically insignificant. n= 18211.\n\nConclusion - Higher total protein is worse for chronic disease outcomes, insignificant for memory issues, mental health and physical limitations. However, plant protein increase is either insignificant \\[chronic disease, memory issues\\] or better \\[physical function and mental health\\]. Animal protein is worse for chronic disease, better for physical function and insignificant for the other 2 in the final model.\n\n**5) 6:33 onwards, Norton says**\n\n>if we break it into the specific types of protein every single type of protein had beneficial effects for each 3% increase in animal protein there was a 7% beneficial effect **meaning if you increase your energy intake from animal protein by 3% you get a 7% reduction in the risk of developing these diseases or a 7% increased likelihood that you will fall under the category of healthy aging** now if we look at Dairy the effect was more powerful it was a 14% benefit for each 3% increase in energy from dairy protein\n\nThe video shows table 3 at this point. It does not say at all what Norton is saying in bold. As I said earlier, animal protein shows increased risk of chronic diseases. Norton is confused between the composite end-point and the individual 4 end points. He totally butchered this with his bias. I think Layne is reading Table 2 still, but the video editor put Table 3 on the video which actually butchers the whitewashing of Animal protein that Norton was trying to do.\n\n**6) 7:55 onwards Norton discuss why plant protein shows better effects (duhh its the fibre)**\n\n>it the amino acids from plants when they're broken down are still just amino acids now you can argue well plant protein has less Lucine. Lucine activates mtor that's going to cause all these problems I don't think that's why plant protein has this Association. one thing they didn't control for was dietary fiber plant protein is going to have by far more dietary fiber than other sources of protein which are basically devoid of fiber so if you're eating more plant protein you're eating more fiber by default and what do we know about fiber for every 10 gram increase in fiber there is a 10% decrease in the risk of cardiovascular disease the risk of cancer and the risk of mortality\n\nIts not just the fibre. At least there are other theories which have not yet been falsified.\n\na) One is the methionine restriction hypothesis. Plant proteins are lower in methionine. Sure, most of this is from rat models and in vitro models, but cant wish it away especially when the human epidemiological results are in line with it.\n\n[Methionine restriction and life-span control](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12973)\n\n[A review of methionine dependency and the role of methionine restriction in cancer growth control and life-span extension](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2012.01.004)\n\nb) Leucine mediated mtor (cant wish it away Layne)\n\n[Identification of a leucine-mediated threshold effect governing macrophage mTOR signalling and cardiovascular risk](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-024-00984-2)\n\nc) All the tons of stuff already there about the association of red meat and processed red meat with higher disease and mortality (which Attia the rebel considers nonsense).\n\n**7) Finally, Norton goes on his animal protein defense rant after 8:20. He also (falsely) uses this study as an example of defense of animal protein.**\n\n>now do I think everybody to go out and buy like soy protein and uh pea protein and rice protein compared to whey protein or something like that I don't think that's going to make a difference\n\nAt 10:55 he says\n\n>Again if protein even animal protein was so bad why do people who have less risk of having lower quality of life as they get older and being at risk for these diseases why are they better off just slightly consuming more animal protein\n\nNo Layne, you are misrepresenting the study. Animal protein intake cause worse chronic disease outcomes, but slightly better physical function outcomes. Plant protein is much better in both.\n\nLayne and Attia keep pushing higher animal protein and fearmongering about sarcopenia in the aged folk, but in this study; when you look at end-point of \"No physical limitations\", for 3% energy increment from \n\na) Animal Protein, OR is 1.05 \\[1.02-1.09 95% CI\\].\n\nb) Plant protein, OR is 1.41 \\[1.27-1.57 95% CI\\]. Clearly plant protein is better at preventing physical issues.\n\nDid Layne read the conclusion written by the authors? They write\n\n>In conclusion, **the findings from this large prospective study suggest that dietary protein intake, and especially the consumption of plant protein, in middle-aged female nurses, may be related to higher odds of healthy aging. Plant protein intake was favorably associated with several domains of health status of older adults, including good physical function and good mental health status.** Our study contributes evidence to the role of protein in the etiology of healthy aging and adds specific insights to the importance of protein sources and relevant etiologic windows in midlife, which may contribute to providing recommendations regarding the amount of protein intake to promote healthy aging. Future research is warranted to verify these findings in other populations and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the associations between protein intake and healthy aging.\n\nThis paper was another one in the long list of studies showing why plant protein is King. Layne Norton twisted the study to suit his bias. Sad really, I do like his content.",

Chickpea pasta is easy to make and also has protein, but my dietitian told me it works for some people and bloats others despite not being high fodmap. You could also try homemade seitan, while wheat has fodmaps, gluten has not, so seitan is safe to eat as long as it doesn't have additives (onion). However, if you are sensible to gluten, it can also create problems, but you can at least try it. Also, some legumes such as canned chickpeas can be tolerated up to a certain amount if rinsed.",

Back when I was a kid, playing Civilization II, the year 2020 was when the game ended. When the future began. And now, it's the future. :o  \n>  \n>We've got a ton of updates to fill you in on, and even more coming up. Let's get started:\n>\n>* New Year's Sale! $5 off with coupon code: **ITSTHEFUTURE**\n>* ~~[Milk Fuel Plain small bags](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/milk-fuel/?flavor=plain&size=20) on sale till~~ they're gone!\n>* Scoops optional: remove from cart page, email us to add.\n>* **New, tasty rice protein**: almost all the old stock is cleared out!\n>* Keto Fuel reduced sodium: most flavors now at 100% DV.\n>* **Pumpkin Spice**: still available, until it's sold out!\n>\n>And more excitingly:\n>\n>* [Keto Fuel Strawberry](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/?flavor=strawberry) is here: under 20g net carbs per day!\n>* **Omega-3 included**: 800mg DHA, 2g Myo-Inositol per day.\n>* New website, new brand, scaling up production soon...?\n>\n>For our New Year's sale this year, get $5 off in January with coupon code: **ITSTHEFUTURE**  \n>  \n>If you have a subscription, just email us once your subscription renews and we'll take off the $5 for you. :)  \n>  \n>~~We also have a few more [Milk Fuel Plain smalls](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/milk-fuel/?flavor=plain&size=20) left, the last of the small bags. Help us get rid of them - they're on sale for really cheap!~~ ;) And of course, **pumpkin spice season** may be over, but we still have plenty of [Athlete Fuel Pumpkin Spice](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/athlete-fuel/?flavor=spice), [Milk Fuel Pumpkin Spice](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/milk-fuel/?flavor=spice&size=40), and [Super Fuel Pumpkin Spice](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fuel/?flavor=spice) left in stock.  \n>  \n>Scoops are now completely optional - no more scoops in the bags - and you can opt out of scoops for your order by removing them from the cart before checkout. If you want a scoop for a subscription renewal, just email us and let us know if you want a scoop next time or every time, and we'll make sure you get it. ;)  \n>  \n>More deliciously, our new organic rice protein *with the amazingly neutral taste* has been giving a big boost to the taste of our shakes (and my confidence in recommending it to people) and almost all the old rice protein stock has been cleared off the shelves. Yay! :D We'd love to hear if you can taste the difference.  \n>  \n>Also, most flavors of [Keto Fuel](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) have been switched over to the 100% DV sodium amount, bringing it in line with our other products. Only a few flavors - cinnamon and plain - still have the old 150% DV sodium in stock. And once those are out, it's 100% DV all the way! ;)  \n>  \n>So... can you guess what's so great about this neutral rice protein and this lower sodium for Keto Fuel? **It means we can finally do** [**Keto Fuel Strawberry**](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/?flavor=strawberry)**!** :D Yes, it tastes great, and it's packed with real, super-expensive freeze-dried strawberry powder, just enough to keep it under 20g of net carbs per day. Try it out, I can't wait to hear what you think. :)  \n>  \n>**And then there's my favorite new feature** \\- vegan long-chain omega-3 fatty acids included in the form of algal DHA powder, and the artist formerly known as Vitamin B8 who we call... Myo-Inositol. :) We've only recently started production on these new (dare I say... *final?*) formulas, so the update has only made it to a few flavors at present ([Athlete Fuel Plain](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/athlete-fuel/?flavor=plain) and [Super Fuel Plain](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fuel/?flavor=plain), for example). But keep an eye out for that in the near future!  \n>  \n>With this update, your bases are covered as far as omega-3 intake, with no need for fish oil or copious quantities of chia or flax - this provides 800mg of DHA per day, with over 1000mg of total omega-3 fatty acids in the powder, and over 2000mg when mixed with oil or milk. **This is a big deal.** It took a little while given some delays with our supplier, but we worked it out - and now it's here. Plus the Myo-Inositol, at 2g per day, should help keep your brain and hormonal system functioning properly. :)  \n>  \n>**Thanks to everyone who filled out our survey on these obscure nutrients!** :D Based on your feedback, we decided to leave off the Acetyl-L-Carnitine, as our extra Vitamin C intake should ensure that your body synthesizes it from protein, and excess oral consumption can interfere with thyroid metabolism. But Myo-Inositol is legally required to be included in baby formula (as is DHA, for that matter) so we figured we should require it of our own. And probiotics proved to be a much more controversial option than expected, so we're definitely skipping those. Take your probiotics separately, if you want 'em. :d  \n>  \n>Oh, and I almost forgot - **we're rebranding.** ;) We've been working on a fancy new website, and we just signed a deal with a bigger manufacturer to seriously scale up our production capacity. More to come in the next few months... :o *And, we want to include some customer photos on the new site for our featured testimonials, so if you want to be famous with your photo on our fabulous upcoming website, send us an email. ;)*  \n>  \n>In the meantime, enjoy the New Year. Wishing you all the best in 2020! :D  \n>  \n>Thanks everyone!  \n>  \n>Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)\n\nAnyway, check us out [here](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/) if you haven't already (or again, if you have!) and don't forget to use coupon code **ITSTHEFUTURE** for a little discount. :)\n\n**Civilization (II) may be ending, but we're still here.** ;)\n\nLet me know what you think of the formula updates, too, I'm excited to hear your feedback! :D",

    "body": "In the past days, I’ve been suffering heavily from acid reflux. Searching some terms brought me to this group, so I thought of sharing some of my experience of how I was able to cure it once. Maybe this will help other people, and maybe it will also help me to find the discipline to do it again.\n\nAround 10 years ago, I was heavily suffering from acid reflux. It started during a period in my life when I was extremely stressed out due to certain situations and family matters. That stress led to immense acid production, and I ended up believing that drinking milk and eating biscuits would help. But that only made it worse.\n\nEventually, I got to a point where I couldn’t lie down to sleep anymore. I had to sit in a chair and sleep while sitting—partially awake through the whole night, drinking milk, eating bread or biscuits, without realizing that I was making it worse with those choices.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks: I randomly searched for the term vegan on YouTube. I don’t even know why. I found a small YouTuber—he was a German fitness guy who had traveled to South America, got inspired by the food there, became vegan, and returned to Germany to start selling vegan and fitness courses.\n\nI liked his videos, so I reached out to him. He was super affordable, so I paid and we had a one-hour video call where I explained what I was eating. He then prepared some material for me and gave me his feedback.\n\nHe told me that eating meat, cheese, and especially drinking milk as a remedy for reflux was completely counterproductive. I told him I was taking 40 mg of Omeprazole daily, which was later doubled to twice a day. He said that if I tried his diet, I might find some relief.\n\nI told him I had consulted doctors and experts who all said the only cure was surgery. But he countered, saying: “You’ve been doing what the doctors said for over a month and you’re still suffering. Why not give this a try for a couple of days or weeks? It won’t hurt—it’s just plant-based food.”\n\nI agreed to try it.\n\nHis recommendation was a bit stricter than what he gave others due to my medical condition. Here’s what he told me to do, which I followed precisely:\n\nDietary Guidelines:\n\n-No processed foods whatsoever. (Yes, technically rice is processed, but he meant ultra-processed foods like bread, packaged sauces, snacks, etc.)\n\n-Bread: strictly forbidden.\n\n-Fried foods: absolutely forbidden.\n\n-I could use a bit of oil in a pan, but cooking was preferred.\n\n-Breakfast ideas: Orange juice, vegan yogurt, oats, nuts, berries, fruits (in any amount I liked).\n\n-Dinner ideas: Lentils, beans, whole grain rice, lots of potatoes. \n\n- I could use salt and mild spices, but be cautious with pepper because of acidity. \n\n-For sauces (like tomato sauce), I had to make them myself from fresh tomatoes—no store-bought sauces. \n\n-No processed meat substitutes (like fake vegan meats)—also considered processed. \n\n-The only two exceptions I made: \n\n-Boiled eggs \n-Honey\n\n-For dinner, he recommended a big salad with fresh squeezed lemon juice, a little olive oil if needed, and no dressings.\n\n-If acid reflux hit, he told me to eat raw spinach—and that really helped. \n\n-Maintain a 5-hour gap between meals. \n\n-15 minutes before every meal, drink a large glass of water and eat a whole apple. \n\n-He also gave me a fitness plan, which I followed. \n\n-After workouts, I was told not to eat for one hour to boost fat burn. \n\n-Later on, I added vegan rice protein powder, even though it’s slightly processed—it helped due to my fitness routine.\n\n\n\nI swear to God, I don’t remember the exact number of days, but in less than two weeks, I no longer felt the need to take Omeprazole. I just stopped taking it.\n\nBefore that, if I missed even one capsule, the next day would be horrible—intense acid reflux that lasted days. But after starting the plan, I had zero reflux. Within a month, it was completely gone.\n\nI didn’t touch restaurant food, bread, white rice—nothing processed. The fanciest dish I had was whole grain pasta with homemade tomato sauce and dried herbs. No cheese. No milk. No fake meats. Nothing processed.\n\nIt felt like my body finally recognized the food I was eating. No chemicals. A true detox. It was amazing.\n\nResults: \n\n-Lost 35 kilograms of weight. \n\n-Felt incredibly healthy and fit. \n\n-Mentally, I felt like I had superpowers. (Think Limitless with Bradley Cooper—that’s how clear my mind became.) \n\n-No need for medication. The reflux was completely gone.\n\nUnfortunately, about 8–9 months later, I broke the discipline. I ate a cheeseburger and it triggered something in me. I spiraled into eating meat and junk food again for days.\n\nEventually, I gained back 20–25 kilograms. The reflux didn’t return immediately, and I still didn’t need Omeprazole.\n\nBut a few years later, stress came back into my life—along with bad eating habits—and I had to start taking it again.\n\nCurrently, I take 20 mg every 12 hours. For the last 3–4 days, something triggered a serious flare-up again. Maybe I lifted something heavy, maybe it was something I ate. But I now have severe reflux again. I can’t lie down without the burning sensation. It’s constant.\n\nI’m trying various remedies, including traditional ones. But when I found this group, I promised myself: I will try it again.\n\nThe same routine from 10 years ago.\n\nIt was high-carb, low-fat—maximum 10 grams of fat per day. And for me, it was absolute magic. I don’t know if it will work the same for others, but for me, it worked like magic.\n\nI wish you all the best.",

I am not unaffected by this plight. \n\nThe holy whey has increased in price for many moons now, and together with other necessities it strains my coffers greatly. \n\nHaving looked at the market of holy potions used in our prayers, I have found that a sack of the pea protein and one of the brown rice protein costs no more than half of the same weight of holy whey.\n\nI read that combining the two grants the same benefits in the iron prayers as the holy whey. Yet here is my question:\n\nIs this the science of the bros, or do the scholars of academia confirm this? May I combine the two and be blessed by Brodin as with the whey?\n\nAlas I feast heartily of the blessed protein rich foods already, so there is no more room to improve my protein intake in such a manner without much distress on my stomach. The holy protein shakes are a must for my humble prayers.\n\nMany thanks for your wisdom, and may Brodin bless your lifts.",

Vanilla](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/schmilk/?flavor=vanilla&size=20)!** :D\n\nWe've never bothered with a vanilla version of Schmilk, because the original flavor works so well, but I've always been curious which would be more popular if we had both. So... now we do! ;)\n\nGive it a try and let me know what you think. :) You can get [a sample](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/schmilk-sample/?flavor=vanilla) or a [whole pack](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/schmilk/?flavor=vanilla&size=20). I'm looking forward to hearing everyone's feedback!\n\nAs far as [Super Protein](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-protein/), this new addition rounds out our lineup of discounted, high-quality DIY ingredients. Combine it with [Super Fiber](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fiber/), [Super Electrolytes](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-electrolytes/), and [Super Micros](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-micros/), and you get, essentially [Keto Fuel Plain](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/?flavor=plain). Add gluten-free oat flour to that and you can make your own [Super Fuel Plain](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fuel/?flavor=plain). Or just use it on its own as a hypoallergenic, vegan protein powder with a balanced amino acid profile, that also has a reasonably good taste and texture.\n\nWe're able to sell it at **$3.00**/day (at 100g protein per day, or **$0.03**/gram of protein) which is competitive with the majority of organic rice protein powder on the market, but ours has added **lysine** to balance out the amino acid profile, as well as **cellulose** for insoluble fiber to prevent constipation, and a little **xanthan gum** to improve the texture and stability. And we've found a specific manufacturer whose rice protein has a much better taste and texture than comparable brands, while also being low in heavy metals.\n\nIf you try it, please let us know what you think! :) [Super Protein](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-protein/)\n\nThanks everyone!",

Now, with high protein intake, I'm bloated and farting up a stinky storm.  \n\nBefore becoming vegan I was addicted to dairy. A half-gallon of whole milk a day was easy and a whole gallon was frequent. My diet was unquestionably worse with less fiber and vegetables and more processed food. I was hitting my protein goals without even trying though.  Never had any gas or stomach issues. This was years ago though so maybe my body and gut flora is just changing, and I would struggle with those also. \n\n  \nMy diet consists of a lot of various fruits, leafy greens, vegetables, legumes, seitan, tvp, soy curls, tofu, pea protein powder, brown rice protein powder, flax, chia, hemp hearts, rice, potatoes, pasta, and almost no processed foods. I keep it pretty simple. I have played around with the various plant proteins to see if one was what was causing the majority of my issues, but they all seem to heave negative effects when taken in high quantities. When i severely cut back on plant proteins my symptoms get better. I drink more than enough water (minimum 2 liters a day) and take more than enough fiber (I've messed around with high and low amounts of food-based fiber and psyllium husk). \n\n  \nOther than that, I eat homemade natto and water kefir along with various other fermented foods. I've tried digestion enzyme pills and have noticed no effects. I've yet to try probiotic pills. In a perfect world I would like to take as few pills a day, especially expensive ones, as possible. \n\n  \nI would really like to optimize my muscle gain but don't want to deal with digestive issues the rest of my life lol I almost wonder if this is what IBS feels like. It seems like a lot of people, vegan and not, consider these side effects of high protein intake just a cost of doing business. I'm seriously contemplating cutting back on protein if that is the case and maybe the extra gains just aren't worth it for me. In the past 2 weeks I've cut back to .5 grams per lbs from .8 and my symptoms have gotten better. \n\nI was really hoping my gut flora and body were just going to take time to adjust but 2 months later and i'm not noticing my symptoms getting any better. \n\n  \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

But here we are. I refuse to spend all day eating and all day chasing macros.

At first, its was wonderful, felt super nice in my hair and for the first time in my life, my frizziness was gone just after using the shampoo and conditioner.\n\nI thought I'd found a shampoo that was perfect for my hair finally, but just recently, it hasn't been so great. For the first 2 weeks, all my frizziness was completely gone, but it seems it comes back more and more with each wash, and I've been getting little tiny flakes of either dandruff or product buildup. I always make sure to scrub my scalp with the pads of my fingers and work the lather down, and the conditioner absorbs so well  into my strands that there's barely anything to wash out after waiting a couple minutes. On top of that, my hair has been getting greasy on my second day, which never happened on any shampoo I've ever used (Suave, Tresseme, RegisDesignline, Big & Sexy, Paul Mitchell). I don't use any heat products or any other kinds of products to set my hair, so I don't think that it's because of damage or product buildup, unless it's somehow the shampoo itself. \n\nI'm really at a loss at this point and not sure if I should try a different line within Shea moisture, to give this one a bit more time, or to try a different brand.\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Shampoo**\n\nWater (Aqua), Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycol Stearate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Trichilia Emetica Seed Butter, Ficus Carica (Fig) Extract, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearamide AMP, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Honey\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Conditioner**\n\nWater (Aqua), Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyropermum Parkii (Shea) Butter *, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Trichliav Emetica Seed Butter, Behentrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Cellulose, Glycerin (Vegetable), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Ether, Honey, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) Tocopherol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG Propyl Silanrtriol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ficus (Fig) Extract",

The top of my scalp was always so so waxy. Yes, I do mean waxy, not greasy. It had turned the hair on the top of my scalp into a straight (no longer wavy) waxy mess. I was full of dandruff, my head was also itchy (which made the dandruff even worse, and god I mean it was *insane* how itchy I was!!!) so I figured I should use more shampoo and really get it sudsing to wash it out. It made my situation worse. I was not using any product in my hair and going to work on the daily so it was always in a bun and I let it air dry almost every night, I was treating it right so I couldn't understand wtf was happening. \nAbout that time I decided I needed a hair cut and apologized in advance to the hair stylist and told her my woes (I'd never seen her before) and once I told her I was using this line of shampoo and conditioner she told me immediately to stop using it. The shampoo I had been using was full of too many oils and I wasn't clarifying my hair in any way. I was kinda drowning my hair in oil. The conditioner didn't really help much either. \nI haven't used their products since cause I was so upset from what it did to me. I know I used a different shampoo but there's something about this line that could never groove with my hair.

Curious to see how the /r/soylent perspective compares.*\n\nHey, I'm axcho. I [started out](https://discourse.soylent.com/t/anyone-selling-their-diy/12910/2?u=axcho) on the Soylent Discourse , then switched over to /r/soylent about a year ago and I still post here a lot.\n\nNow that I've got [my own company](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/) **making a range of hypoallergenic soylent alternatives** and Rosa Labs has caught up with their backlog, the discussion has shifted from DIYers to Soylent customers and I find that most people in these online communities don't find my contributions to be too relevant anymore.\n\nAnyway, in case anyone *is* looking for soylent alternatives here, I wanted to ask, **What *are* you looking for that Soylent isn't able to offer?**\n\nBased on the year I spent [taking custom DIY requests](http://custombodyfuel.com/about/) and designing many dozens of recipes for people, I think I have a sense of what people are looking for. And I've designed a standard set of five recipes (each with customizable calories and multiple flavors) that is meant to encompass the range of what people might want. But I wonder if there's anything else.\n\nSpecifically, there's...\n\n* [Schmilk](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/schmilk/) (**cheap** and actually tastes good to normal people)\n* [Light Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/light-fuel/) (**low-carb**)\n* [Keto Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/) (no-carb for **ketogenic** weight-loss)\n* [Athlete Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/athlete-fuel/) (**high-protein** for muscle-gain)\n* [Schmoylent](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/schmoylent/) (the original Soylent imitation when there was a backlog)\n\nThat basically covers everything that people have asked me for, aside from those with certain medical conditions (gastroparesis, hemachromatosis, etc). Weight-loss is big (Keto Fuel), as is the cheap and tasty option (Schmilk). Schmoylent still has its devoted fans. And high-protein (Athlete Fuel) and low-carb (Light Fuel) are a bit more niche.\n\nI've done my best to keep them accessible to as many people as possible regardless of dietary restrictions, so they're all hypoallergenic (gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, nut-free, etc) and *almost* completely vegan (working on that) as well. For people who want animal protein instead of just rice protein, the just-add-milk recipes (Schmilk, Athlete Fuel) make that possible without jeopardizing the dairy-free status of everyone else. And all of the recipes have been optimized for taste and texture, at least to the extent possible!\n\nRight now my company is not able to compete on price (except Schmilk) and convenience (it's hard to beat Soylent 2.0) because of the small scale of our operation and limited equipment. But at least for now, I think we've got something for just about everyone, regardless of goals or diet or caloric needs or food sensitivities. I wanted to be able to provide a commercial-quality product without leaving any of my old custom customers out in the cold. And I'm wondering if I've accomplished that.\n\nWhat do you think?

Everything you've listed here made for some great selling points, it will be better when its completely vegan but that's not a deal breaker for me. Keto Fuel is more what I was looking for, but since I hadn't tried anything like these before I wanted to keep my costs down in case I hated it. I have it for lunch and/or dinner, its pretty damn good. As stated on your website, a blender made all the difference. Definitely will get more, possibly KF this time. All I could ask is that it be cheaper because my small food budget is the main reason I'm trying these. But this is already one of the cheapest options, and I understand that's likely unrealistic. Keep up the good work. \n\nEdit: oh yea, and vanilla schmilk needs to be a thing.",

        "body": "I'm in Europe so I'm unlikely to ever try your product, but based on my own experiences shopping around here for different products as well as comments from other people I know that consume a lot of powdered food, some things you might want to consider:\n\n- Make something that doesn't have too much artificial sweetener.  There's a couple of reasonable products here in Europe that are unfortunately spoiled by being far too sweet completely unnecessarily. (I see you have one unsweetened variant; but see next points)\n- Offering a range of flavours helps a lot for people who want to live on your product 100%.  Queal and Joylent are good examples.  Cinnamon and chocolate are good starters, but some fruit flavours (strawberry and banana being popular and easy) would definitely help round out your options.\n- \"Unsweetened\" shouldn't really be a flavour.  If your target market seems to like the sweetened variants, offer all your flavours in sweetened and unsweetened variants.\n- Schmilk may be cheap, but looking at Blendrunner, it could be cheaper (especially when factoring in the cost of adding milk rather than water; sure, milk is pretty cheap, but it's far from free).\n- Be aware that some customers prefer to \"mix and drink straight away\" and others prefer to mix a larger batch and refrigerate.  Your products should ideally be capable of both.  Some products I've tried here such as Jake and Nano have to be consumed straight away as refrigerating for any significant period of time turns them to a thick sludge.  Others such as Mana have a sand-like texture until they've been sitting in the fridge for at least 6 hours.\n- Bonus points if it's capable of having a room-temperature shelf life of around 8 hours or more so that I can take it out of my fridge in the morning and drink in the afternoon at work without it having been cooled since.  This is even after 36 hours in the fridge.\n\nSo, these aren't jabs or complaints - I've unfortunately never tried your products (although I'd like to, just to know what they're like) - just ideas based on my experiences with a range of different products here in Europe.\n\nFor reference by the way, I really didn't like Rosa Labs Soylent 1.3 or 1.4; they had a weird kind of 'malty' taste that lingered as an aftertaste on the breath.  Others don't seem to report it, but since I found it with two different versions, I'm assuming it's something they're using that I'm sensitive to from a taste perspective and most other people aren't (however it could be that some people who just \"don't like it\" also found the same but didn't mention it specifically).  Even if it didn't have this, I'm a \"100%er\", so the lack of flavours would probably get to me after a while.  I don't need a lot of flavour, but some variation helps to look forward to it instead of dreading it.",

    "body": "So when I was in remission with Crohn's I used to love using a pre-workout shake such as NO X-plode, Whiteflood, etc. but since I'm in an active flare up, I can't handle the caffeine/stims for the life of me. I wanted something to give me a little energy boost, but more importantly a nice \"pump\" feeling at the gym. Here is what I'm currently taking  \n \n* **L-Arginine**: An amino acid that is a precursor to producing nitric oxide in the body. The idea is that nitric oxide helps dilate blood vessels to increase nutrition to your muscles when you go to the gym, thus giving you that \"pump\" feeling. \n* **Beta-alanine**: An amino acid that increases muscle carnosine levels at the gym. Carnosine is a peptide that acts as an anti-oxidant against the buildup of hydrogen ions (H+) during high intensity exercise. Decreasing H+ ions will help decrease overall fatigue during high-intensity workouts. \n* **Creatine Glycerol Phosphate**: Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid that occurs naturally in the body and helps to supply energy to all cells in the body, primarily muscle. It increases energy by directly increasing the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is known to increase overall strength. Why take creatine glycerol phosphate? It's way easier on the stomach, at least from my experience.\n\nI usually take the pre-workout shake about 15 - 20 minutes before I hit the gym. I take 2 scoops of orange flavored L-arginine, 1 tsp of unflavored beta-alanine, and 3/4 scoop of unflavored creatine GCP. I notice that I get a slight energy boost and some really nice muscle pumps. Most importantly though, my joint stiffness has completely gone away and it has made me more confident to lift harder and put on extra muscle mass.    \n\n\n  \n*My recommendation is to start with L-arginine and see how your body reacts to it. There are studies that show the benefits of L-arginine and Crohn's which I will talk about in a little bit. After supplementing with L-arginine, add in beta alanine. If beta-alanine works fine, add in 1/4 scoop of creatine GCP. I've never had bloating with creatine GCP, but take this with caution as creatine can have those side effects. If it works for you, then gradually increase your dosage.*  \n  \nAfter my workout, I take whey protein and **glutamine**. I can handle dairy, but most Crohn's patients have difficulty digesting dairy, so I'd recommend buying a rice protein or a soy protein after workout. Glutamine is another amino acid which is known for promoting muscle recovery, which is why I like taking it after my workout. 1 heaping tablespoon works fine with me.  \n\n*L-glutamine has even been proposed as a treatment for Crohn's disease because it can help with symptom control, but may be best combined with the amino acid arginine.\nThe reason glutamine and arginine might be important is because they help calm harmful chemicals known as cytokines. Glutamine and arginine also reduces the expression of TNf-alpha, which is what medications such as Humira are designed for.* This information has been taken from a 2008 article in the [Journal of Nutrition](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/138/12/2481.full).  \n\nSo yeah, the pre-workout I've experimented with has seriously worked wonders for me at the gym and I was able to put on 13lbs out of the 20lbs I've lost. I'm not saying it will work for everyone, but if you were a pre-workout junkie like me, just try to make your own with ingredients that you like. Gradually add them and see if your body responds well to it. Good luck everyone, and I hope this information is somewhat useful!  \n\n    \nHere are some helpful links:  \n1.

Apparently you can make it yourself with the custom mixer on truenutrition.com, and it comes out about the same price as a tub of whey even after shipping costs.\n\nThe one thing that confuses me is absorption. He said it has the same amino acid profile as whey, which is fast absorbing. Now, TrueNutrition lists a pre-mixed product with nigh identical contents, but it's under \"overnight recovery\", which is what Casein would normally be used for. I'm unsure if this is an appropriate substitute for whey, casein, and/or both.",

Dealing with some supply issues lately, but more interestingly, **considering adding some new ingredients to our formulas...** Curious to get your thoughts in [the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTiLQZwK9h_8RdgIop03ik5qAYG0GiR6nJj-si_SPmmebFvg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and in the comments here!\n\nHere's [the email](https://superbodyfuel.com/blog/december-2021-update/):\n\n>Hi everyone,  \n>  \n>It’s been a while! Not much has changed on our end in the past year, honestly – I’d been hoping we’d be announcing our shiny new rebrand by now, but things are still a few months behind schedule. :p  \n>  \n>As the great Shigeru Miyamoto once said, *“A delayed game is eventually good, but a bad game is bad forever.”* Spoken like a true perfectionist. In other words, stay tuned.  \n>  \n>**The good news is we’re** ***not*** **increasing our prices!** Other than that, we just have some supply issues and delay-causing complications to update you about. And [a survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTiLQZwK9h_8RdgIop03ik5qAYG0GiR6nJj-si_SPmmebFvg/viewform?usp=sf_link) at the end. A fun survey.\n> \n> * Delays, especially for international shipping!\n> * **NATURELO:** temporary placeholder vitamins.\n> * [Super Micros](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-micros/): out of stock for a few weeks.\n> * **Strawberry:** out of stock until next March!\n> \n>As you may have noticed, we’ve got a perpetual rolling backlog that is putting us as much as two or three weeks behind on some orders. I’m sorry about this ongoing issue. :/ If you’re lucky, you might not get much of a delay at all, but most likely, it will take a couple weeks before we can ship out your order. On top of that, the postal system has been slower than normal, and it’s particularly bad for destinations outside the US, like Australia. If you can swing it, I’d recommend keeping some extra on hand to cover you when these delays happen.  \n>  \n>We also just got notice that the EU is adding customs taxes to smaller orders that may have previously slipped under the threshold. We are already barely breaking even (or even losing money) on international orders, so this is not something that we can really help with right now. If you’re in Europe, you might want to hold off on ordering for a bit, given the combination of our backlog, slow international shipping, and additional customs fees – we honestly may not be able to provide enough value to make it worth your while (or ours, for that matter!).  \n>  \n>**You may have also heard about the global supply issues that have been affecting businesses all over.** There was even [an article about it in the San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Why-is-stuff-costing-more-The-case-of-one-16596604.php) recently, featuring our friendly business neighbor Nana Joes Granola! We’ve so far been able to stay nimble and dodge most of these issues, but there are a couple that we’ve just been hit with.  \n>  \n>First of all, we recently ran out of our custom vitamin premix before we were able to get a resupply, and so – a year and a half since the last time – we are back to using placeholder vitamins instead. As before, we’re substituting the high-quality vegan brand [NATURELO](https://naturelo.com/product/one-daily-multivitamin-for-women/), which includes the same methylated B vitamins and chelated minerals so it will hopefully be of comparable quality. But it’s still not the same, I know. Fortunately, we should be getting the next shipment of our custom vitamin mix before the end of this month, so you can expect to see it back in [our products](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/) (and Super Micros!) by January.  \n>  \n>We also got word from our freeze-dried strawberry supplier that they will be out of product until next March, which is a long time. Yes, there technically *are* other suppliers of real strawberry powder, but based on our taste tests, there’s only one that tastes good enough to (barely) justify the price, and so we’re out of luck. :/ We still have some of our strawberry products in stock, but they’ll be gone soon, and it will be a few months before we have it available again. So if you have a subscription that includes strawberry, I’d recommend switching the flavors now. Feel free to email us and we can take care of it for you – just let us know what flavor you want instead.  \n>  \n>I also want to say a big thanks to all of you who participated in our [scoop size survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQnvXZoZAAlVGORrGlCFH1G4adTOtgwl9XeWBOYd6ckx-a6Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) earlier this year! :) There was a very slight majority in favor of keeping the big scoops as-is, so we haven’t changed anything.  \n>  \n>**And now for the speculative stuff…**\n> \n> * netParcel: cheaper Canadian shipping?\n> * **Glycine:** should we add it to our formula?\n> * **Inulin:** dare we open Pandora’s box again?\n> * Please [take the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTiLQZwK9h_8RdgIop03ik5qAYG0GiR6nJj-si_SPmmebFvg/viewform?usp=sf_link)!\n> \n>Have any of you had experience with [netParcel](https://netparcel.com/)? One of our Canadian customers recommended it as a way to get cheaper Canadian shipping. We might give that a try soon, which would involve switching (only) Canadian shipments from USPS to UPS. This could potentially save enough money that we could afford to bring our Canadian shipping fees down to (nearly) the level of our US shipping. Seems almost too good to be true, right? If you have experiences with netParcel, good or bad, let us know. If you’re in Canada and have opinions on UPS shipping in your country, please let us know also!  \n>  \n>Lastly, the fun stuff. **In the past several months I’ve been experimenting a lot with various supplements for sleep and mood and tissue repair, and one of the most interesting I’ve come across is *glycine*.** Glycine is an amino acid, one of the building blocks of protein, found in significant amounts in collagen and skin and joints, moderate amounts in plant proteins, and smaller amounts in muscle tissue (and rice protein, turns out!).  \n>  \n>Super smart nutrition guy Chris Masterjohn (check out [his free resources on vitamins and minerals](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/2019/03/06/vitamins-minerals-101)!) recommends supplementing glycine if you eat meat (or rice protein?), in order to achieve a [4:1 ratio of glycine to methionine in your diet](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/balancing-methionine-and-glycine-in-foods-the-database) and improve your physical and mental health. He suggests that the human body expects this ratio in order to function optimally, which is easy to achieve if you’re eating mostly plants and “the whole animal” but rare these days when muscle meat is the main source of protein for most people.  \n>  \n>The good news is that glycine powder is cheap, vegan, hypoallergenic, and tastes sweet (with a slightly weird aftertaste if you take a lot). And in order to achieve a 4:1 ratio of glycine:methionine, we could add 2g of glycine per meal of Super Body Fuel. It would even pay for itself, given that we could lower the amount of expensive monkfruit sweetener slightly to account for the sweetness of the glycine. **Initial taste tests are very promising.** The slight sweetness even balances out the natural bitterness of the Plain flavors as well.  \n>  \n>The bad news? Well, there isn’t any, as far as I’ve found. Glycine can even improve your mood and sleep, via very gentle effects on the serotonin system (unlike the heavy-handed effects of tryptophan or 5-HTP, for example). People like Chris Masterjohn might argue that it’s just about giving your body the glycine levels it naturally expects, so it can run smoothly and calmly the way it’s supposed to. I just want to run it by you all before we pull the trigger and add it. What do you think? Let us know in [this short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTiLQZwK9h_8RdgIop03ik5qAYG0GiR6nJj-si_SPmmebFvg/viewform?usp=sf_link)! :)  \n>  \n>**I’ve also spent a while experimenting with prebiotic fiber sources this year and building up my tolerance for the notoriously potent *inulin*, and I’ll admit I’m tempted to play with it again in our Super Body Fuel formulas.** But don’t worry! I wouldn’t do it without consulting with you all first, via [this same survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTiLQZwK9h_8RdgIop03ik5qAYG0GiR6nJj-si_SPmmebFvg/viewform?usp=sf_link). ;) Inulin is delicious (tastes like cotton candy), sweet and smooth, the best prebiotic fiber source… if not for the explosive flatulence it can cause in some people. :o  \n>  \n>But you know, with up to 1g of inulin and 2g of glycine in a meal of one of our plain flavors, “Plain” becomes truly neutral and decently tasty, all without any sweeteners at all (no monkfruit!). The texture is better too. And if you start small, you can usually adjust to tolerate inulin without all the gas – there’s certainly an argument to be made for mixing fermentable fibers, like acacia and inulin, rather than using high doses of a single type as we currently do…  \n>  \n>**Still, that’s all theory – if it doesn’t work out for you in practice, it doesn’t work out.** :p We’re not going to do it unless we’ve thoroughly tested it to the point of success. So let us know if you have a concern, and let us know if you want to be a **brave tester** to find out if it would cause a problem for you, via the survey:  \n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTiLQZwK9h\\_8RdgIop03ik5qAYG0GiR6nJj-si\\_SPmmebFvg/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTiLQZwK9h_8RdgIop03ik5qAYG0GiR6nJj-si_SPmmebFvg/viewform?usp=sf_link)  \n>  \n>Even if you don’t have an opinion on glycine or inulin, **we’d also like to hear from all of you about your digestive experience generally on Super Body Fuel** – any gas or bloating, constipation or diarrhea, or is it all just smooth sailing for you? :) Please weigh in on [the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTiLQZwK9h_8RdgIop03ik5qAYG0GiR6nJj-si_SPmmebFvg/viewform?usp=sf_link)!  \n>  \n>Thank you, and Happy Holidays! :D See you next year. ;)  \n>  \n>Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)\n\nThanks! :)",

    "body": "Didn't see this posted here, but for those looking for keto option, /u/axcho just sent the following email:\n\nHi everyone,\n\nHappy May! :) In honor of International Worker's Day, I'd like to take the opportunity to plug one of my favorite books of the last few years, Reinventing Organizations. Decentralized, self-organizing businesses really do exist, in industries from manufacturing to healthcare, and this book shows how it can be done. As an idealist who has found myself suddenly running a manufacturing business with a growing team of employees, I find this vision extremely inspiring and I hope that someday this business can have as big an impact of empowerment and liberation through the lives of the people working for it as it does through the products it sells.\n\nAnyway, here are the updates:\n\nNew rice protein that doesn't taste awful!\nBack to next-day shipping, or close to it.\nFree US shipping on orders over $100!\nBimonthly subscriptions now available.\nThe biggest good news is that we've been able to get a better placeholder rice protein that doesn't have the awful burnt taste of the previous one. All the products made in the last month or so have been made with this new rice protein. Phew! :p Still no updates on availability from our preferred supplier, but the worst is over.\n\nPart of the reason we didn't announce this earlier is that we were also a bit backlogged over the past month as well. One of our manufacturing technicians, Justin, had to stop working due to (unrelated) health issues and production slowed as we filled in for him and looked for a replacement. Fortunately, he is recovering and we have hired Julia, who, along with Jamaica, is now cranking out batches at an impressive rate. So we're happy to say that the shipping delays of the last several weeks have been resolved, and we're back to shipping next-day, or close to it!\n\nNow that we're caught up with our backlog, I'm excited to finally introduce something I've wanted to do for a while: free shipping on larger orders. As we've honed our process and seen sales stabilize at a sustainable level, we are finally at a point where we can begin to pass cost-savings back to you, our customers. So, to start with, we are offering free shipping on orders and subscriptions over $100! :D This is only for US orders - unfortunately international shipping is still prohibitively expensive, though international expansion is part of our plan, as soon as we have the volume to make it work, logistically.\n\nAs part of this update, we're adding the option to have your subscription delivered every two months, so that you can consolidate your subscription into a larger order to save on shipping. If you'd like to change your subscription, just tell us in an email and we'll take care of it for you. ;) Or, you're always welcome to cancel your existing subscription and set up a new one yourself.\n\nComing soon:\n\nNew, odor-free vitamin mix just arrived!\nMCT oil powder for Keto Fuel coming in June.\nNew electrolyte mix for better nutrition and taste.\nWe just received our first shipment of our custom vitamin mix from our new supplier, reformulated to be free of the sulfurous odor of the original batch. It was the L-Selenomethionine, the active selenium compound that gives garlic and onions their characteristic odor, and to a lesser extent the particular brand of Choline L-Bitartrate, that caused the smell after all. We're now using the odorless amino acid chelate Selenium Glycinate instead, and a more expensive but relatively odorless Choline L-Bitratrate in this version. You can expect to start receiving product with this new mix over the next few weeks.\n\nMore excitingly, we've just put in an order for a custom MCT oil powder made with Acacia Gum, which we are expecting to receive by the end of May. The plan is to add it to Keto Fuel, at a dosage equivalent to about half a tablespoon of MCT oil per meal, so you'll no longer have to buy and add MCT oil yourself when using Keto Fuel! Even better, this reduces the dusty lightness of the Keto Fuel powder that is so annoying when trying to scoop and pour it. :p And crucially, we've been able to get the costs of this extra ingredient down enough that we won't be raising the price of Keto Fuel at all - it will just be a better product, at the same price. So we're really looking forward to rolling this out in June. :)\n\nAlso, we've just finished lining up the last suppliers for our electrolyte upgrade, and will be getting our hands on these new ingredients by the end of the month if all goes well. We've found that the electrolyte Potassium Citrate is responsible for the majority of the unpleasant flavors in our products, especially the potassium-heavy Keto Fuel, and we are cautiously optimistic about the opportunity we have here to significantly improve the taste with a few formula tweaks. So, we'll keep you posted on that - and if you want to help out with taste-testing, definitely let us know. ;)\n\nLast but not least, thanks for your help with our branding survey in February! We've been glad to hear that the qualities that we've been most proud of, in terms of our product and service, are the same qualities that you notice and appreciate. However, it's also clear that neither \"Schmilk\" nor \"Super Body Fuel\" do a good job of expressing that brand identity. So we're going back to the drawing board as far as articulating our brand and coming up with a name and visual identity that will really speak to what is unique about us. Stay tuned! ;)\n\nThanks again for sticking with us!\n\nAlex Cho Snyder (axcho)",

We know that some of you don’t like sucralose so, like with Black Edition, we have given you the choice between them\n\n* You will be able to buy either v1.0 or v2.0\n* We have a variety box of v2.0, so if you want to try all 4 flavors you can\n* We will be putting single v2.0 RTDs in the ‘add more to your basket’ section of checkout, as well as in the account area\n\nExcited for you guys to try it out as these are special😉\n\nLink: [https://huel.com/products/huel-ready-to-drink](https://huel.com/products/huel-ready-to-drink)",

I find this difficult to drink. It's possible to drink though. To me it tastes like dirt and the extra caffeine makes my stomach feel weird.

Is a little extra health for me more important than numerous lives?\"  \n\n\nHonestly, despite my good intentions of following a healthy vegan diet, in practice, my diet wasn't that healthy. I started out being careful to get the nutrients that a vegan diet was lacking in but became more careless about it over time and just got into habits of eating the vegan foods that I liked without calculating \"this has x amount of selenium this has x amount of iron this has x amount of b6 etc.\" So if any vegans want to tell me I didn't try hard enough, I'll concede that. Maybe if I was really obsessive about nutrition it could have worked better.",

    "body": "Hello everyone! This is my review of the updated 2016 PrimalKind 2016. Full disclaimer: I was sent a sample of this product for free in exchange for my review. HOWEVER, I am going to be 100% honest and accurate in this review without regard to the fact that I received the sample for free.  I have previously reviewed Nutberg in a much similar fashion, which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/4scpj8/my_detailed_review_of_nutberg_2016_formula/).\n\nNotes about me: 6'1, 200 lb male, living in California. I have been a vegan for 8 years (on ethical grounds, not nutritional), and a vegetarian for 7 years before that. My primary interests (as they relate to soylent products) are sustainability and nutrition. Price, taste, and texture are all concerns, but they take a back-burner to environmental and nutritional considerations for me. Prior to sampling PrimalKind, I have tried DIY soylent, Soylent 1.4, Soylent 1.5, Soylent 2.0, and, most recently, Nutberg 2016. Since I am in the USA, this will be a US-centric review with regards to pricing, shipping times, etc. Now, on to the product!\n\nFirst, [here in an Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/JmQas) with some pics of the box and product (before and after mixing).\n\n**Shipping:** The package arrived 8 days after/u/primalkind said he had shipped it. Since that is coming from Australia to west-coast USA, this seems like a pretty good shipping time.\n\n**Package condition:** Good, some minor indentations on the corners of the shipping box but nothing torn or damaged. The PrimalKind packets inside were totally untouched and undamaged.\n\n**Food safety:** I'm not certain about the food processing and safety standards in Australia, but I imagine they are similar to the US and EU (AKA not much of a concern).\n\n**Price:** For a large-size order (28 meals, AKA 7 days @ 2000 calories per day), PrimalKind is currently selling for $122 USD plus $41 shipping. That comes out to $23.30 per day, or $700 per 30 day month. If they implement free shipping, the price would drop to $17.40 per day, and $522 per 30 day month.  With this pricing, PrimalKind is definitely a premium product.  The pricing is much higher than some of the main soylent competitors (especially Soylent and Joylent). However, if you are comparing it to other products in it's niche (Ambronite, Bertrand, Sani), it is comparable in price.  It is also one of the few ketogenic options you can buy that doesn’t need any additional ingredients.\n\n**Smell:**\n\n*Natural, Dry:* Definitely nutty. It smells like macadamias with a bit of coconut.  It also reminded me of a sweeter version of nutritional yeast.\n\n*Cacao, Dry:* VERY similar to the smell of the Natural flavor.  There was maybe a slight hint of cacao smell, but it was very mild.\n\n*Natural, Wet:* Pretty much the same smell\n\n*Cacao, Wet:* Pretty much the same smell\n\n**Color:**\n\n*Natural:* Dark yellow/cream-colored\n\n*Cacao:* A light brown color, similar in color to brown sugar\n\n**Texture:**\n\n*Natural, Dry:* Similar texture to coconut flour or stone ground flour, but with larger nut pieces\n\n*Cacao, Dry:* The texture seemed slightly smoother than the Natural, but still with nut pieces\n\nNote: Before mentioning my prepared texture experiences, I should note that the official recommendation on the PrimalKind bag is to blend the product.  I can see why, since the shaken version still contains larger nut pieces, which might put some people off.  I don’t mind the texture, since it gives me a bit of chewing which helps with fullness.  However, if you want a smooth product, you will want to blend it for sure. I ignored those directions initially, just so I could test the product both ways.\n\n*Natural, shaken with 450 ml ice water:* It mixes very easily and is much thinner than Soylent 1.5. The texture is not quite what I would call gritty.  It is more like a soup with small nut pieces (a mix of very smooth with large nut chunks).   Part of the ingredients immediately settled to the bottom, although I couldn’t tell what the ingredients were specifically (small, dark particles).  If you like a product that involves chewing small pieces, you will like this.  You can definitely tell it contains pieces of nuts ground with other whole food ingredients.  Personally, I felt that 450 mL of water was too much water, so I used only 400 mL for my testing with the cacao flavor.\n\n*Cacao, shaken with 400 ml ice water:* Same as the Natural option.  The drop of 50 mL of water made the product a bit thicker, probably closer to Soylent 1.5 thickness.\n\n*Natural, with 450 ml ice water and blended:* Blending is definitely the way to go if you like a smooth texture.  There was some grit still, but overall the product had a mouthfeel much closer to Soylent 1.5. I have a Vitamix which pulverizes pretty much everything, so I'm not sure if a regular blender would have as much of an effect, but since you are mostly blending up the small nut pieces, a regular blender should do fine.  I still think 450 mL is too much water.\n\n*Cacao, with 400 ml ice water and blended:* Same as the Natural option\n\n**Taste:**\n\n*Natural, when drinking immediately:* The flavor is very nutty, mildy earthy, with a very mild savory component.  The product was much sweeter than I was expecting, since the label only lists 3.3 grams of sugar per serving.  When I double-checked the packet, I noticed monk fruit extract was one of the ingredients.  This is a newer, non-caloric sweetener similar to stevia (plant-based).  I have had packets of monk fruit sweetener before (in tea and other drinks), and I think the taste of monk fruit resembles real sugar more than stevia or aspartame.  For me, monk fruit is tied with sucralose (Splenda) in the ‘flavor’ category.  Overall, I immediately enjoyed the flavor, and it was almost too easy to drink the whole serving!\n\n*Natural, when drinking after 3 hours in fridge:* Same as before\n\n*Cacao, when drinking immediately:* The flavor is very similar to the Natural option, but slightly less sweet and more savory.  Honestly, I could barely taste the cacao powder.  The overall flavor was still nutty and earthy, with a very mild savory component.  The cacao version seemed a little less sweet than the Natural, so maybe the bitterness of the cacao was balancing out some of the sweetness of the monk fruit.  I generally like cacao powder and chocolate flavors, but the Cacao version just seemed like a less-sweet, slightly more bitter version of the Natural option.  Overall, I would stick with the Natural flavor in the future.\n\n*Cacao, when drinking after 3 hours in fridge:* Same as before\n\n**Satiety:**\n\nI was not hungry 3+ hours after my servings. I think the quantity of fiber helped keep me full, and perhaps the low glycemic effect was helpful as well. However, I am not someone who gets hungry easily, so it's hard to get a good judgement from just a few 500 calorie servings.\n\n**Notes while drinking:**\n\n*Natural:*  I immediately enjoyed the flavor of my first serving of the Natural flavor.  It was nutty and moderately sweet, reminding me of a slightly sweet nut butter.  I ended up going through my serving pretty fast, and had to remember to slow down and take the proper tasting notes! I don't have a problem with grit (I am used to DIY ingredients and vegan protein powders), but I definitely preferred it blended.\n\n*Cacao:*  After beginning to drink the cacao flavor, I thought of it very similarly to the Natural flavor, but a little less sweet.  As I continued drinking, I liked it less and less.  I’m not sure if it was the cacao that added an underlying bitterness to the overall flavor, but it just didn’t work as well for me as the Natural option.\n\n**Nutrition:**\n\nNUTRITIONAL DISCLAIMER: Nutritional science is ever-evolving and always in dispute. There is good and bad science supporting and dismissing many different nutritional principles and ideologies. Each person has to do their own research and decide what they believe for themselves. I personally am a big fan of large epidemiological studies, as well as metabolic ward studies and R+DB+PC studies. I have come to some conclusions that many others here have not, and that's OK. Particularly, I don't believe that food science is at a point where we know exactly all of the ingredients that are optimal for health and lifespan, and I still believe that a whole foods approach is a healthier option. I support products like Soylent because I like their vision of sustainability and their goals of progressing food science and of making a perfect food. I just don't think they are there yet. I will try to link to some of my supporting evidence in the paragraphs below, but frankly I'm not here to start any battles. I am simply trying to share my thoughts on PrimalKind and what I believe to be the pros and cons of the product with regards to modern nutrition.\n\n**Ingredients:** The product is primarily ground up macadamias, pumkpin seeds, and coconut flour, with the exception of some blends of vitamins, powdered foods, and ‘energizing’ ingredients.  It is paleo-friendly, keto-friendly, vegan, and GMO-free.\n\n**Protein:**\n\n*Quantity:* Lower in protein (65/75 grams). I'm not a huge protein fiend, but I do think a plant-based diet requires slightly more protein than the standard RDA due to the decreased digestibility and [PDCAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Digestibility_Corrected_Amino_Acid_Score) of plant proteins. My personal ideal body-weight (according to BMI) is around 80 kg (176 lbs, 6'1 male). With a 2000 calorie serving of PrimalKind, that works out to 0.875 g/kg of protein, or 0.4 g/lb. The US RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg or 0.36 g/lb, while bodybuilders and power-lifters tend to shoot closer to 2.2 g/kg (1 g/lb). Personally I believe that the RDA is too low for many groups (the elderly, vegans, the sick/malnourished), but I also believe that 1 g/lb is [definitely excessive](http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/).  PrimalKind is on the lower end of this spectrum, so people looking to gain muscle mass, those on large weight deficits, or those in the ‘at-risk’ groups I mentioned above may want to consider supplementing.\n\n*Quality:* The protein in PrimalKind has a good amino acid score.  Pumpkin seed protein contains a balanced ratio of all essential amino acids.  Macadamia nuts are very low in lysine, but the PrimalKind site has actually done due diligence and listed the amino acid breakdown of their products.  I used this info to calculate the ratios of all the essential amino acids compared to the amino acid ratios of an ‘ideal’ protein.  Overall, the aminos in Primalkind exceeded the ideal ratio for every essential amino acid. Lysine just barely exceeded the ideal, and as such, is the limiting amino acid in the product.  If you supplement with additional protein, your best option is a protein high in lysine, which is basically any protein powder that’s not rice protein (grains are generally lysine-limited).\n\n**Carbs:**\n\n*Quantity:* Very low, net carbs ~31 per day (I think; the site doesn’t make this clear).  This is definitely a low-carb product, and is marketed as a ketogenic-friendly option.  My thoughts on carbs are that the quality (starches, fibers, sugars) is generally more important than the quantity.  With that being said, many people have had great success with weight loss on keto diets (/r/keto is filled with success posts).  I think a keto lifestyle can help some people break their addiction to ‘junk’ carbs like sugars, boxed foods, and ‘white’ products (bread, pasta, etc.).  As a vegan, my regular diet doesn’t really allow me to experiment with the keto lifestyle, so this product would be a great option if I wanted to try out a low-carb life while still keeping to my veganism.\n\n**Fiber:**\n\n*Quantity:* About 37 grams, although I had to go to the site to find this info, since it’s not listed on the nutrition panel.  Like Nutberg, this a product with much more fiber than Soylent.  I heard stories of people complaining about the gas effects from paltry amounts of fiber in 1.4, so in 1.5 the fiber was reduced even further, which is frankly a nutritionally bad idea. There is more and more evidence that [humans evolved on high fiber diets](https://michaellustgarten.wordpress.com/2015/07/17/on-a-paleo-diet-not-if-you-fiber-intake-is-less-than/), and those with high fiber intakes have [better health outcomes](https://michaellustgarten.wordpress.com/2014/08/02/is-dietary-fiber-associated-with-reduced-mortality/) than those with lower intakes. Fiber is now being shown to be essential for maintaining a healthy gut (and a [healthy body overall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOZcbNw7sng)) by feeding our gut bacteria.  The fiber was increased in Soylent 1.6, but not to the level of PrimalKind.\n\n*Quality:* The nutrition panel doesn't actually give a breakdown of the types of fiber in PrimalKind, but the main ingredients all contain a mix of soluble and insoluble fibers. Both fibers are important for health (insoluble adds bulk and helps pass stool while soluble feeds our gut bacteria).\n\n**Sugar:**\n\n*Quantity:* PrimalKind has only 13 grams of sugar per 2000 calories. Compared to many Soylent-type products, this is a very low amount of sugar. I don't believe PrimalKind has released data on the glycemic load of their product, but with the very low quantities of sugar and carbs, and the higher amounts of fiber and fats, I would expect this product to have a very low GL value compared to its competitors.\n\n**Fats:**\n\n*Quantity/Quality:* 180 grams total, 45 grams SFAs, ~18 grams PUFA's. First, let me say that the saturated fats are higher than are currently recommended by most nutritional governing bodies, but recent research may be indicating that the SFA's in coconut may be less harmful than the SFA's in fatty animal meats. Also, the negative effects of SFA's are partially mediated by cholesterol and refined carbs in the diet, which this product has none. Overall I wouldn't worry much about the saturated fats. With regards to the PUFA's, there is a very good balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fats (about a 1:4 ratio).  From what I can tell, all of the omega-3 fats come in the form of ALA fats, and there are no added EPA/DHA fats. The website mentions EPA/DHA fats, but the only source I could think of for those fats would be perhaps the kelp, since EPA/DHA is found in ocean plants.  Even if all the omega-3 fats are ALA, [research indicates](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/92/5/1040.full) that even those with a zero intake of EPA/DHA still have similar levels of those fatty acids in their blood when compared with EPA/DHA consumers. The general thought is that the body becomes better at converting ALA to EPA/DHA when the dietary intake of EPA/DHA is low, whereas if you are getting EPA/DHA in the diet then your body won't bother converting as much. Overall I would be glad if there was actual DHA in the product, but I also don't feel that it's strictly necessary.\n\n**Micronutrients:**\n\nHonestly this section could take me hours to type up, but this review is already quite long so I will try to be succinct. My thoughts on the 'optimal' levels of vitamins and minerals generally come from health outcomes measured in large epidemiological studies. Obviously these studies can have flaws, but I think looking at large population groups (and correctly controlling for variables) is a good way to what quantities of different nutrients are optimal. For some analysis of micronutrients and optimal dosing, see some of the blog posts on [this site](https://michaellustgarten.wordpress.com/category/diet-and-mortality/).\n\nWhat I like: First, let me say that it looks like they have done some good research and have chosen very bioavailable forms of their vitamins and minerals.  Added choline is nice to see, since it’s not technically a required nutrient, but it has been shown to have some beneficial effects.  PrimalKind has above-RDA values for vitamins A, C, D, E, and the B vitamins. These are vitamins where the RDA is a little low, so it's nice to see a bit of an excess above 100% for these nutrients. Personally, I would prefer potassium, vitamin K, and zinc to be a bit higher, but they meet the RDA.\n\nWhat I don't like: Low sodium levels.  Sodium is an essential nutrient and would have to be supplemented on a PrimalKind-only diet. Salt is just a mineral and is easily be added, so I am thinking it was only left out of the product to improve taste. I understand the importance of making your product taste good, but I don't like the idea of sacrificing nutrition to do it.  Higher levels of salt and potassium are even more important on keto diets, since many people seem to require larger-than-normal doses of these electrolytes to help stave off ‘keto flu’.\n\nFinally, a note on the ‘energizing’ and ‘whole food’ blends.  Personally I don’t have a need for an energizing blend in my food, but I can see the benefit for people who are active and can use a boost to help with their workouts.  As for the whole foods blend, I personally like this addition.  The blend is basically a mix of powderized fruits, vegetables, and spices.  Now, obviously, fruits, veggies, and spices are all great, healthy foods to include, but I’m not sure if the quantities are large enough to have much of an effect.  With that being said, some of the ingredients are known for being very high in antioxidants (amla), while the others have had very promising results in various studies (turmeric).  Overall, I think it’s great that this blend is included and it doesn’t appear to negatively affect the taste to any great extent.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR Conclusion:** I definitely like PrimalKind. Overall this looks to be a very healthy, low-carb meal replacement. You get a vegan/keto/paleo food with many of the benefits of 'whole foods' cooked at home, but without the work of going to the store, preparing the ingredients, cooking, and ensuring your diet has a balanced profile of macro and micronutrients. The texture (when blended) is smooth, but not ultra-smooth.  Having a DIY background and experience with 'gritty' ingredients like rice protein, the texture didn't bother me at all.  For flavor, I really enjoyed the sweet nuttiness of the Natural option and it was very easy to drink an entire serving.  I didn’t care much for the Cacao flavor option, since the cacao flavor was very mild and seemed to add to the bitterness of the product.  From a nutritional perspective, I think this product has a good profile.  The protein levels are lower than I would like, but the fiber levels are still good and the glycemic load is likely very low (great for diabetics).  Nutritionally, PrimalKind checks off an huge amount of boxes (vegan, keto-friendly, paleo-friendly, GMO-free, grain-free, dairy-free, low-carb), which makes it a good option for everyone except those that have a nut allergy or those that feel the need for more carbs or protein in the diet.  I like the powdered food blend and the focus on optimizing vitamin and mineral levels.  I don't prefer having to add sodium, but it is an easy addition to make. Regarding the price, I am a budget-conscious consumer so I would really love to see a drop in price.  Currently the product is much higher even than Soylent 2.0, but I also understand that it’s filling a space in the market that 2.0 isn’t.\n\nThat's it. I hope you enjoyed the review! I can answer any questions anyone has about PrimalKind or about my thought processes.",

        "author": "primalkind",
        "body": "Wow, thank you very much for this awesome detailed review [u/dreiter](https://www.reddit.com/user/dreiter)\n\nWe’re so happy you like our updated PrimalKind 1.2 blend and we hope everyone can appreciate the PrimalKind difference. \n\nWe really appreciate you taking the time to write such an incredible in-depth review of PrimalKind and for providing us with some amazing feedback, that we will definitely be actioning in future updates and as food-science continues to evolve we will continue to update our blends accordingly. \n\nWe have reduced the level of Cacao in our new blends, because we received some feedback that the original Cacao blend was a bit bitter for a couple of customers. I personally like the rich flavour of raw cacao, but I’m concerned some customers might think it’s a sweet Cadbury’s/Hershey's chocolate flavour. However now we have included Monkfruit in our blends it has definitely taken the edge off the cacao & we have now received feedback from other customers that they would like more Cacao, so we feel this could be more a personal preference? \n\nWe really have to thank [u/axcho](https://www.reddit.com/user/axcho/) from Super Body Fuel [superbodyfuel.com](http://superbodyfuel.com) for recommending Monkfruit. We would have never considered using any sweeteners, but after axcho recommendation & much research we believe Monkfruit is the only natural sweetener suitable. Our original blends did not contain any sweeteners and the flavour was more suited to traditional healthfood products, however now we have included Monkfruit we believe PrimalKind will now be more appealing to a broader community of health conscious consumers. \n\nWe have increased the level of Protein in our latest blends and to stick with the Ketogenic concept of low carb, high healthy fats, & medium protein, therefore we have not put high protein levels in our blends, instead we have ensured there is sufficient Essential Amino Acid levels. Anyway as suggested the Protein can easily be boosted to suit personal health goals. I personally boost the protein levels in my post workout PrimalKind meals. \n\nWe are considering the option of releasing a PrimalKind blend with higher levels of protein for our Primal fitness, Crossfit, & Ketogains fans, although with the current restrictions on Hemp protein in Australia we are considering the option of using a raw grass-fed WPI, so please let us know if you or anyone else would be interested in this? \n\nWe have also increased the Potassium & Sodium levels in our latest blends. Although the latest food-science suggests higher levels of sodium, we feel a lot of people still follow the low-salt trend, so for now we have increased the Sodium levels to the maximum Australian RDI, and as the latest sodium food-science becomes more acceptable we will continue to adjust our blends accordingly. \n\nThe Omega3 in the pouches only includes ALA, however as per our suggestion you should take one Omega3 capsule with each serve of PrimalKind to get a high quality source of DHA & EPA Omeaga3. We originally included the Omega3 capsules with our blends, but our customers requested additional capsules or to provide the pouches without capsules (because they already had their own Omeaga3 capsules), so we decided to provide the Omeaga3 capsules separately in our PrimalKind V1.1 update and we reduced the price of the pouches accordingly. We have investigated the option of including DHA/EPA powders in our blends, however they’re current manufactured with Maltodextrin, so for now we’d prefer to continue with a cleaner Omega3 capsule. \n\nThanks again for all your help [u/dreiter](https://www.reddit.com/user/dreiter) for all your time & for helping us test our International Shipping processes. We will officially announce our international shipping to the US & Canada shortly. We have just prepared an [International Shipping Guide](http://primalkind.com/faqs/) to help show shipping costs & approximate currency conversions. Please note this is a guide only, all pricing shown on our website is in Australian dollars (AUD) including 10% Australian GST. Australian GST is not applicable on International orders and will therefore the 10% GST will be automatically deducted for international orders.",

While over there she sent me the money and said with whatever is left to get her a snack. As i was lookinf she starts texting me saying oh I shouldn't have gone to the shop i did because it will take too long to get to her (its a 5 minute walk) so i reassured her it will be okay. And while i was there she asked to get her a milk chocolate protein pudding as her snack and i do. Little did i know as i don't buy that food there is a minor detail that i missed, the pudding i picked up wasilk chocolate RICE protein pudding.\n\nAnyway i get to hers in time and give her the bread which shes happy with then the pudding. And she gets mad after having a close look at it. It says in small writing on the back that theres rice in it which she doesn't like this one. So she blows up at me saying because of this she has no time to get ready for work and eat breakfast. But every few sentences she will just slide in oh but i appreciate you going out in the heavy rain to get the bread.\n\nSo i leave a little upset as i had no clue about this difference in the pudding and just in the end feel as if my time was wasted and that she just didn't truly appreciate me going out of my way and trying to help her out this morning. I conveyed this to her a hour later but she was having none of it saying that she did appreciate it which is why every few sentences she said that. But to me that just felt like she was trying to lessen the blow at me getting shouted at. So we blow up again and said she doesn't want to talk to me because how much i fucked up this morning over what i would call a minor inconvenience.\n\nI just don't know where we go from here, like what do i even try text her as to me she currently rn is disregarding how i feel about the situation and invalidating how i viewed it from my POV. Im just looking for some help on this if anyone could help us out here?",

Making them with part whole wheat pastry flour would up the nutritional content as well and the texture would be masked by the peanut butter.\n\nAlthough I haven't tried it, hemp hearts would be easy to hide in things like carrot cake, and they are about 31% protein by weight\n\nThe only time I tried cooking with whey protein, I made banana bread.  It had 6 grams of protein per 50 gram slice and excellent flavor, but the texture was a little tougher and spongier than standard banana bread.  You could eat a few slices, but it wasn't super enjoyable.  I suspect that trying for an excessive amount of protein is going to result in your texture suffering.",

Also, think about mixing in or sprinkling on some hemp hearts, they give a good fatty (almost nutty) flavor and are packed with protein.\n\nI would try rice or pea protein replaced for parts of your flour.

I recently just purchased the no7 Protect and Perfect facial suncream in SPF50, 5 star UVA from Boots http://www.boots.com/en/No7-Protect-Perfect-Intense-Facial-Sun-Protection-SPF-50-50ml_1483958/\n\nI've been using it for just over a week, and my skin is looking amazing. It is clearing up my redness/uneven skintone and PIH - my skin looks almost as clear as when I was 13, before I started tanning heavily in the summer (I'm 22). Previously I was using the no7 protect and perfect daycreams, because they had spf15 in and 5 star UVA protection. In comparison to this suncream though, they barely did anything to noticeably improve my skin. \n\nAs far as application goes, I find it moisturising but not too greasy (haven't had any trouble with it breaking me out). I've been having trouble finding a good facial sunscreen so pretty pleased I gave this one a go :)\n\n\n\nIngedients:\nAqua (Water), C12-15 alkyl benzoate, Octocrylene, Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene glycol, Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (nano), Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, Tribehenin, Cetearyl alcohol, Glycerin, Diethylhexyl butamido triazone, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium cetyl phosphate, Decyl glucoside, Parfum (Fragrance), Mica, Acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, Methylparaben, Xanthan gum, Tocopheryl acetate, Ethylhexyl salicylate, Actinidia chinensis (Kiwi) fruit water, Propylene glycol, Sodium hyaluronate, Ethylparaben, Ascorbyl glucoside, Hydrolyzed rice protein, Potassium hydroxide, Alcohol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Retinyl palmitate, Medicago sativa (Alfalfa) extract, Sorbitan laurate, Panax ginseng root extract, Carbomer, Dipropylene glycol, Polysorbate 20, Morus alba leaf extract, Sophora angustifolia root extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium benzoate, Ascorbic acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methyl benzoate, Tocopherol, Acetyldipeptide-1 cetyl ester, Palmitoyl tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7, CI 77891 (Titanium dioxide).",

It would give me intense stomach aches. \n\nSo I switched to casein, which oddly enough was fine. I consumed that for awhile and it was much lesser of a stomach irritant. I'm still not certain how this was, because finally I came to the conclusion that I either have or have developed a lactose problem. It's difficult for me to think I've always had it, because as a kid I ate cereal every day with tons of milk, often with a glass of milk on the side, and no issues.\n\nI've since moved to rice protein, and get NO stomach pains. Also, and for some this may not matter, but it seems a lot of of rice protein brands are fairly health conscious as well. An example being this [Growing Naturals Rice Protein](http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Naturals-Organic-Protein-Vanilla/dp/B008U7MM8I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1397584875&sr=8-2&keywords=rice+protein)\n\nIt is:\n\n* Dairy Free\n* Gluten Free\n* Soy Free\n* Organic\n\nMy only warning is that it has a slightly grainy consistency. It does however mix pretty well, the flavors are definitely fine. Reviews are good on Amazon. I will take a slightly grainy consistency if it means I'm not getting awful gas, bloating, stomach pain.\n",

I am curious as to what people do to meet their protein goal without blowing their carbs sky high. Talking to one of my friend's who is vegan he mentioned foods such as quinoa, lentils, beans and oats. All of these have more carbs than they do protein, so although they are good sources of both and are good to put into a diet, using them as a source of protein doesn't seem efficient. Tofu I see as a good source, but that can get rather expensive and the meal would need to be quiet large to give a significant amount of protein. \n\nCarbs:Protein\n\nBeans are 3:1\n\nLentils are 2:1\n\nOats are nearly 4:1\n\nQuinoa is about 4.5:1\n\n\nI understand that mixing pea and rice protein together per shake can give about 50g of protein easily but rather than having multiple shakes per day to hit the goal what do people do?",

I’m optimistic. :)  \n>  \n>The news we have to share with you today is all (mostly) *pretty* good news:  \n>  \n> * January sale: 20% off with coupon code [**BASICALLYEAR**](https://basicallyfood.com/discount/BASICALLYEAR)\n> * BOOST chocolate and BUILD chocolate: *temporarily out of stock :(*\n> * New manufacturer: **BOOST**, **BUILD**, and **BURN** chocolate on the way (no DHA)\n> * **Basically Vitamins**, **Electrolytes**, and **Protein**: now available!\n>  \n>First of all, here’s a little (belated) New Year’s sale to kick off 2024 – use the coupon code **BASICALLYEAR** for 20% off [Basically Food](https://basicallyfood.com/) during the month of January. :)  \n>  \n>*If you missed out on the* ***SUPERBODYFAM*** *coupon code in 2023, this is your chance to get the same discount this month. But if you still have an active subscription using SUPERBODYFAM, don’t cancel it – the discount will continue until you cancel! And you can reschedule, postpone, and edit the subscription in the meantime.*  \n>  \n>We don’t have any further discounts or sales planned out at the moment, so this is your best chance to get one if you’re looking for a deal! ;) Finances are very tight for us now, so we can definitely use all the non-discounted sales we can get. Personally, I’ve opted to take a pay cut to just below subsistence income, in order to maximize the chances that we *won’t* run out of money or inventory this year. :d But don’t worry about that. *We’ll be fine.* :\\]  \n>  \n>*Speaking of inventory,* **we are temporarily out of stock of** [**BOOST chocolate**](https://basicallyfood.com/products/boost) **and (very nearly)** [**BUILD chocolate**](https://basicallyfood.com/products/build), as those are apparently our most popular items at the moment. But the reason we don’t have more is *not* for lack of funds, it’s because the new manufacturer we were going to work with turned out to be… not so great after all. :p  \n>  \n>But the good news is, we have finally placed an order with a *new* new manufacturer, who so far seems to be quite promising, both in terms of pricing and quality (attention to detail). We’re very excited about it, honestly. If all continues to go well, **we should have another 1000 units each of BOOST chocolate, BUILD chocolate, and also** [**BURN chocolate**](https://basicallyfood.com/products/burn) **(the next most popular) in… a few months**, most likely? A *couple months* if we’re lucky.  \n>  \n>Obviously, any number of months other than **zero** is less than ideal, and we’re really sorry to leave you chocolate-lovers hanging. :/ If you’re really craving your chocolate, might I suggest *adding 100g of cocoa powder to a tub of vanilla-flavored Basically Food powder and shaking it up to make chocolate?* :3 Or just make do with cinnamon. Your choice.  \n>  \n>Oh, and for those of you who responded to the [DHA survey](https://superbodyfuel.com/blog/basically-food-update-dha-survey/) a few months ago (or those who experienced the dreaded fishiness firsthand), we have analyzed the feedback and come to a tentative decision: **no more DHA.** Starting with the three chocolate batches we just ordered.  \n>  \n>I was surprised to find that nearly half of all respondents had experienced fishiness at some point in the last few years of Super Body Fuel and Basically Food, and nearly half of those people were adamant that we remove the offending DHA from the formula or else they would not continue to buy our product. Many of them had already stopped! Even considering the self-selection bias in survey respondents, *that’s a lot of people.*  \n>  \n>What made the decision for me, though, was [this study on the shelf-life of DHA powder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666833520300137), which showed that it could last pretty long at room temperature, but at 122°F (50°C), literally 0% of the DHA powder remained after six months. It had all oxidized – transformed from a vital nutrient to a disgustingly fishy smell. How much DHA would remain after a few days at 122°F in a shipping truck in the summer? Probably more than 0%, but even if a small percentage oxidized during that time, it would make the whole thing unpalatably fishy.  \n>  \n>If we can’t guarantee that the temperature will stay cool at all times, we can’t guarantee the amount of DHA in the final product, and we can’t guarantee that it won’t get fishy. :/ So no DHA.  \n>  \n>*But…* there’s a bright side! Just last month I came across [another study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327812000580), showing that **you can actually synthesize enough DHA from the plant-based omega-3 fat ALA**, *as long as* you only get a tiny amount of ALA (*alpha-linolenic acid*) and a tiny amount of the plant-based omega-6 fat LA (*linoleic acid*, not Los Angeles). Too much omega-6 (as in seed oils), and even too much omega-3 (as in flax or chia), is actually *counterproductive* and *blocks* the conversion step. You can see relevant snippets from the full text quoted in [the discussion thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/18mu6h3/think_alpha_linolenic_acid_is_useless_think_again/), showing that olive oil (which has a small amount of omega-6 LA, and an even smaller amount of omega-3 ALA) actually results in just as much DHA in the end as ALA-rich *flaxseed oil*, but without the significant oxidation risk. And similarly for milk fat – it’s even better than olive oil.  \n>  \n>*That is a game changer.* That means that the small amounts of ALA and LA in the olive oil or avocado oil or cream you add to BURN or BALANCE, or the milk you add to BOOST or BUILD, **should be enough to produce sufficient DHA in your own body!** That is, *as long as you stay away from high-omega-6 foods like seed oils* (aka, “vegetable” oils, and to a degree, nuts and lard and poultry fat) – which you really *really* ([really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kGnfXXIKZM)) [should already be doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/mokljg/introduction_to_the_stearic_diet_first_draft/), anyway. My health (and skin) is *so much better* since I started [strictly cutting out seed oils](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopEatingSeedOils/) a few years ago. **I still eat corn chips** – I just bake my own from organic corn tortillas and they’re just as crunchy. :d  \n>  \n>Of course, if your brain is still growing, as a kid or teenager (or even young adult?) or if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you’ll need more DHA, and it would probably be a good idea to eat seafood once in a while or take a quality DHA supplement.\\* If you’re craving fatty fish, you’re probably needing a bit more DHA. If not, maybe not.  \n>  \n>**Lastly, we finally have our Basically** ***supplements*** **available to order**, with fully fleshed-out product pages and nutrition info and such – thanks for your patience. :) There’s [**Basically Vitamins**](https://basicallyfood.com/products/basically-vitamins), which is like [Super Micros](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-micros/) but mixed with cellulose to prevent it from absorbing moisture and clumping. There’s my favorite, [**Basically Electrolytes**](https://basicallyfood.com/products/basically-electrolytes) ([Super Electrolytes](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-electrolytes/)), which I mix with water and [Stur flavor drops](https://www.amazon.com/Stur-Enhancer-Flavored-Calories-Sweetened/dp/B01M311CXS) to make a refreshing drink that I enjoy daily. And based on the feedback from our [supplements survey](https://superbodyfuel.com/blog/basically-food-update-supplements-survey/), there’s [**Basically Protein**](https://basicallyfood.com/products/basically-protein), which is like [Super Protein](https://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-protein/) without the added gums and fiber. Just brown rice protein and amino acids. Doesn’t taste great, but you can mix it with something that does! ;D  \n>  \n>We don’t have a ton of these in stock, so no pressure to go out and order them, but they’re available for those of you who can’t go without. :3  \n>  \n>Anyway, that’s it for now – enjoy the sale ([**BASICALLYEAR**](https://basicallyfood.com/discount/BASICALLYEAR)!) and best of luck getting your January off to a good start! :)  \n>  \n>Thanks for sticking with us. Take care, all! :D  \n>  \n>Alex Cho Snyder (axcho)  \n>  \n>*\\* It’s not just DHA – the same goes for protein, by the way. Adults need less, kids and teenagers (and athletes) need more. The key here is “adults need less” – there’s been some fascinating discussion and experimentation in the* [*nutrition nerd hangouts I frequent*](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/) *about* [*protein-restricted diets*](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/17yfgg6/show_me_the_bcaa_studies/) *for weight-loss, energy and longevity. And I’ve been doing my own version of the experiment, eating a loosely vegan diet consisting of mostly starch with a bit of fruit and veggies, with no added protein or fat. I’m also consuming plenty of old expired Milk Fuel samples mixed with just water, though! ;p*  \n>  \n>*Maybe it’s my rice farmer ancestors, or maybe it’s the degree to which I’ve been force-feeding myself protein at every meal since I was a teenager, but my energy and sleep have been great and I’m gradually losing the little bit of belly fat that tends to show up when I eat a balanced diet while severely stressed and sleep-deprived. No cravings for meat or protein whatsoever – not yet. It’s fascinating. The traditional “peasant diet” works! Who would have thought?*  \n>  \n>*Keto is certainly faster for burning off belly fat, but my energy and sleep tends to suffer whenever I restrict carbs. Eating as much starch as I want while restricting protein and fat is just… easy, for me. I noticed the same thing when I ate lots of starch and a fair amount of protein while cutting out fat completely, when I was doing hard physical labor on a daily basis, manufacturing at Super Body Fuel last year. But apparently the protein part is pretty much optional for me too. At least for now. :p*  \n>  \n>*Well, I’m definitely saving a lot of money on my food bill this way! And I finally have a use for all that extra oat flour that was left when we shut down SBF manufacturing. Homemade oat crackers are quite delicious. :\\] And oat cakes, and oat cookies, and oat pancakes… Maybe even oat dumplings, though I haven’t tried those yet. :d*  \n>  \n>*Anyway. Feel free to reach out if you want my recipes. ;)*\n\nCurious to hear if you have any thoughts about our decision on the DHA, or the subject of ALA conversion and LA avoidance (see r/SaturatedFat and r/StopEatingSeedOils for more on that) and how it relates to our formula or those of other brands such as Soylent and Huel.\n\nHappy New Year! :)",

Official recipe is outlined in three posts for [macronutrients](http://blog.soylent.me/post/68180382810/soylent-1-0-macronutrient-overview), [micronutrients](http://blog.soylent.me/post/69835344439/soylent-micronutrient-breakdown), and [other ingredients](http://blog.soylent.me/post/73232819517/there-is-more-to-food-than-nutrition-even-a).\n\nOfficial recipe adds fish oil, gum arabic, vanillin, and sucralose. It has no psyllium husk powder. It also includes a lot of info about the ingredients' production processes. \n\n>Potassium (3500mg) from Potassium Gluconate (15,750mg) - Potassium is produced commercially from the mineral Sylvite (KCl)\n\n>Sodium (1500mg) from Sodium Chloride (2100mg) - Sodium Chloride is mass-produced by the evaporation of seawater...\n\n>Calcium (1000mg) from Calcium Carbonate (2500mg) - Calcium carbonate is primarily used in the construction industry as a building material and comes from rocks such as calcite and limestone.\n\n>Vitamin C (90mg) as Ascorbic Acid - Today ascorbic acid is produced industrially from glucose by the Reichstein process, which won Tadeus Reichstein the Nobel Prize in 1933.\n\n>Vitamin B3 (16mg) as Niacin - Thousands of tons of Niacin are synthesized annually from 3-methylpyridine.\n\n>Zinc (11mg) from Zinc Sulfate (27.5mg) - Over 12 million tonnes of zinc are produced annually, mostly for industrial use\n\n>Vitamin B5 (5mg) as Calcium d-pantothenate - Pantothenate can be synthesized industrially from any lactone and beta-Alanine.\n\n> Vitamin D (15ug) as Ergocalciferol - Interestingly, vitamin D is produced industrially by exposing a sheep’s wool grease product or alternatively yeast or mushroom extracts to intense UVB light.\n\nThe following micros don't have any production information. Vitamin Bp (550mg) from Choline Bitartrate (1375mg), Vitamin E (15mg) as Alpha-tocopherol, Manganese (2.3mg) from Manganese Sulfate (6.4mg), Vitamin B2 (1.3mg) as Riboflavin, Vitamin B6 (1.3mg) as Pyridoxine HCL, Vitamin B1 (1.2mg) as Thiamin HCL, Vitamin A (900ug) from Retinyl palmitate (1636ug), Copper (900ug) from Copper Gluconate (6429ug), Vitamin B9 (400ug) as Folic Acid, Iodine (150ug) from Potassium Iodide, Vitamin K (120ug) as Phytonadione, Selenium (55ug) from Sodium Selenite (120ug), Molybdenum (45ug) from Sodium Molybdate (98ug), Chromium (35ug) from Chromium Chloride (106ug), Vitamin B7 (30ug) as Biotin, Vitamin B12 (2.4ug) as Cyanocobalamin.\n\nA lot of those sound like they're derived from pretty basic industrial and chemical processes though.",

Especially if we'll be selling it separately to DIYers!\n\nSo without further ado, here's my latest thinking on the premix spec, per daily serving:\n\nNutrient | Amount | Unit | Form | % DV | Highest RDA of DRI \n----------|----------|------|-------|--------|-----------------------\nVitamin A | ~~4000~~ 3000 | IU | Retinyl Palmitate | 60% | 3000 IU\nVitamin A | ~~2000~~ 3000 | IU | Beta Carotene | 60% | 3000 IU\nVitamin C | 360 | mg | Ascorbic Acid | 600% | 90 mg\nIron | 10 | mg | Ferrous Gluconate | 55% | 18 mg\nVitamin D | 2400 | IU | Ergocalciferol | 600% | 600 IU\nVitamin E | ~~30~~ 36 | IU | Tocopheryl Acetate | 120% | 33 IU\n | ~~30~~ 0 | mg | Mixed Tocotrienols | * | *\nVitamin K | ~~40~~ 160 | mcg | Phytonadione | 200% | 120 mcg\nVitamin K | 80 | mcg | Menaquinone-7 | 100% | 120 mcg\nThiamin | 1.5 | mg | Thiamin HCl | 100% | 1.2 mg\nRiboflavin | 5.1 | mg | Riboflavin | 300% | 1.3 mg\nNiacin | 20 | mg | Niacinamide | 100% | 16 mg\nVitamin B6 | 3.6 | mg | Pyridoxine HCl | 180% | 1.7 mg\nFolate | 200 | mcg | L-Methylfolate | 50% | 400 mcg\nFolate | 200 | mcg | Folic Acid | 50% | 400 mcg\nVitamin B12 | 12 | mcg | Cyanocobalamin | 200% | 2.4 mcg\nVitamin B12 | 6 | mcg | Methylcobalamin | 100% | 2.4 mcg\nBiotin | 300 | mcg | Biotin | 100% | 30 mcg\nPantothenic Acid | 60 | mg | Calcium Pantothenate | 600% | 5 mg\nIodine | 180 | mcg | Potassium Iodide | 120% | 150 mcg\nZinc | 15 | mg | Zinc Glycinate | 100% | 11 mg\nSelenium | 210 | mcg | L-Selenomethionine | 300% | 55 mcg\nCopper | 2 | mg | Copper Glycinate | 100% | 0.9 mg\nChromium | 216 | mcg | Chromium Picolinate | 180% | 35 mcg\nMolybdenum | 75 | mcg | Molybdenum Glycinate | 100% | 45 mcg\nCholine | 550 | mg | Choline L-Bitartrate | * | 550 mg\nBoron | 500 | mcg | Boron Glycinate | * | *\n\nBoron is a trace element that does not have an established recommended intake. However, it is involved in bone formation, and it's easy and safe to supplement, so we might as well include it just to be safe.\n\nNickel, silicon, and vanadium are also trace elements without an established recommended intake, but they are present in sufficient amounts in brown rice and oats (which [our products](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/) at Super Body Fuel are based on) so there's no need to supplement in our premix.\n\nManganese and phosphorus are both present in significant amounts in both rice protein and oat flour, so we won't supplement them either.\n\nIron is present in significant amounts in rice protein and oat flour as well, but not enough to meet 100% DV, and additionally the bioavailability of grain-based iron is quite low. So we will partially supplement.\n\nWe add our electrolytes separately, since they are bulky and vary from product to product, so they're not included in this premix. So if you're wondering about potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium, that's why they're not included in the spec.\n\nWe'd been hoping to use Vitamin D3 rather than Vitamin D2 (or at least a mix of both), because of the potentially greater bioavailability of the D3 form. However, we have been searching for two months to find a manufacturer that can offer a vegan D3 (made from lichen instead of sheep's wool) and unfortunately, not a single one will do it. So we will probably use D2 for now, until we can command the volume to be able to afford to source our own vegan D3. More details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/4gpffb/vegan_vitamin_d3_does_it_even_exist/).\n\nWe've also been having similar difficulty trying to find a manufacturer that offers tocotrienols at a reasonable price, so we may have to forgo this for now as well, unfortunately.\n\nMore details to come - I'll update this post later with in-depth explanations of each of the included micronutrients.\n\nFor now, I just want to get this out there for the most dedicated nutrition enthusiasts to start digging into. :)\n\nPlease share your thoughts below, and we'll look forward to incorporating your feedback to design the best vitamin mix possible before placing an order! :D",

        "body": "This looks really good! There are a few changes I'd make which I'll post here, but honestly it looks great as it is in spite of these things.\n\n1) Up vitamin D to 3800 I.U. per day. Seems high but it's what I go for after having read it in this study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18541590\nReports of vitamin D toxicity have been greatly exaggerated, and there has, in fact, been no case of toxicity occurring below 10000 I.U. for an extended period of time (at least from my research). You could, as a result, go for 5000 I.U. but I think tailoring it to people with existing deficiencies is probably an unnecessary cost.\n\n2) Cut down a little on vitamin A. The NHS website generally isn't great for the vitamin and mineral content, and annoyingly they don't cite sources, but while I was checking for information regarding vitamin A, I saw this:\n\"According to some research, having more than an average of 1.5mg a day of vitamin A over many years may affect your bones, making them more likely to fracture when you are older.\" -http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vitamins-minerals/Pages/Vitamin-A.aspx\nNow whilst the official UTL is 10000 I.U. per day, I'm wary of that statement and feel it's best not to take the risk. 1.5mg is the same as 5000 I.U. so the 6000 I.U. in the mix may be a little high. My suggestion would simply be removing the 2000 I.U. of the inferior beta carotene as the 4000 I.U. from retinyl palmitate is plenty.\n\nIt's really nice to see 300 micrograms of biotin in the mix as there's a lot of research suggesting that figure is ideal even though it's way higher than the recommendation. I question the 60 milligrams of pantothenic acid, but I admit, I haven't researched that as in-depth as the other vitamins so I'm sure there's evidence pointing towards that being ideal. Riboflavin is also higher than I'm used to seeing but again, I'm sure you've seen research to support this. \n\nIf possible, I'd up total vitamin K to 150 micrograms by upping menaquinone-7 by 30. \n\nAnd despite the contents of Super Body Fuel making up the difference in the other elements (iron, manganese, phosphorus and the trace elements), if this is something you intend to work on over time it would be really cool to see it also provide these for those wanting to entirely DIY, but due to minimum purchase quantities, it's totally understandable if this is an impossibility.\n\nSomeone else mentioned zinc orotate which could well be a better choice but is likely also quite a bit more expensive.\n\nLeaving out the electrolytes seems wise.\n\nOh and as someone else says, have all of the folate coming from L-Methylfolate.\n\nAny idea on what sort of price you'll be charging for the product so far? And sorry my post has been a bit messy, I've been jotting things down as I came up with them for the most part!",

I like the increased selenium, although it might be a bit higher than it needs to be (just nitpicking here).\n\n2. I love the increased C, D, and B12 levels.  Folate seems solid, but you could maybe go just slightly higher for an extra safety margin?  Again, nitpicking.\n\n3.  Just a comment, I think any of the chelated forms of zinc will work just fine.\n\n4. I would increase K1 quite a bit, but that's a personal preference.\n\n5.  Personally I would cut down a bit on the retinyl A and increase the beta-carotene, perhaps setting them at 3000/3000.  As per [this page](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#h8) there are risks at taking retinyl A at doses higher than the 3000 IU recommended daily amount.  There are no such risks with beta-carotene.  Plus, vitamin A deficiency will be very rare on a 3000/3000 dosing, because even if the body requires more than the 3000 IU retinyl dose, that leaves enough beta carotene to be converted to cover any deficit.  From the linked page:\n\n>Observational studies have suggested an association between high intakes of preformed vitamin A (more than 1,500 mcg daily—only slightly higher than the RDA), reduced bone mineral density, and increased fracture risk [1,4,37]. However, the results of studies on this risk have been mixed, so the safe retinol intake level for this association is unknown. Total intakes of preformed vitamin A that exceed the UL and some synthetic retinoids used as topical therapies (such as isotretinoin and etretinate) can cause congenital birth defects [2-4]. These birth defects can include malformations of the eye, skull, lungs, and heart [4]. Women who might be pregnant should not take high doses of vitamin A supplements [2]. Unlike preformed vitamin A, beta-carotene is not known to be teratogenic or lead to reproductive toxicity [1]. And even large supplemental doses (20–30 mg/day) of beta-carotene or diets with high levels of carotenoid-rich food for long periods are not associated with toxicity. \n\nAnyway, even with none of these changes, your recipe looks much better than any of the current products on the market!",

The guy in charge of SuperBodyFuel is allergic to a lot of things so he is VERY conscious about allergens in food. I'm lucky to only be allergic to cats (which is why you will never find any cats in Keto Chow) so my recipes include potential allergens because the results taste better (to me). Anyway, Keto Fuel is \"gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, and nut-free\", It's also barely not vegan (has trace gelatin from the vitamins). Because it's dairy free it needs a plant based protein source and soy protein would invalidate the \"soy free\" claim so they use rice protein, which is what Soylent 1.x also uses. Rice protein is a difficult beast because it can impart a gritty texture. The Chocolate Keto Fuel also has Cocoa powder for flavoring which can add some grittiness too.\n\nLately I've been experimenting with using Acacia Gum for fiber in Keto Chow instead of Psyllium husk powder, the result is what little discernible texture there was is now completely gone so I've been drinking almost oddly smooth stuff for a bit. The texture of Keto Fuel was quite a change compared to that. Personally I've had some REALLY gritty meal replacement drinks in the past and Keto Fuel is actually pretty smooth by comparison. It's far smoother than People Chow was (corn masa) and given the goals in the recipe I think it's probably as good as you could possibly do. Now one caveat: I followed the instructions on the package with the heavy cream option instead of the olive oil option since I'm not lactose intolerant and know it'll taste WAY better this way. I drank one meal and kept the rest for family and friends doing keto to try. I'll not lie: none of them liked it, but none of them have allergies that would prevent them from drinking Keto Chow. \n\nI'm of the opinion that if you do have problems with dairy, soy or nuts then it's an excellent product; especially considering how difficult a ketogenic diet is with those kinds of restrictions.",

A blender is involved, I imagine?\n\nIt's my impression from dealing with cold oatmeal that the oats, if cooked in less liquid, will cool to a pretty solid consistency anyway. If you don't cook them to a complete sludge, leave some of the grain structure, they would gel up I would think.\n\nI've never handled maltodextrin directly. You get it as a powder? If so, you can maybe just cut it in to the cooked oats to make a dough.\n\nIf it comes as a syrup? You need some kind of binder to dry up the syrup so it doesn't ooze out of the bar. But the rice protein powder(?) should do that. Dribble the syrup into the rice protein while whisking madly, see how much syrup you can load into a given quantity of protein powder to make a stiff dough. More experiments! And cut that into the cooked oats.\n\nIf any of that works (and remember, I have no bleepin' idea) you would have a heavy dough and then you could just try spreading it 1cm thick on a silicon baking tray and bake it and see. I'm betting though, that it would be crumbly. You will probably want to add some kind of a binder. Can you tolerate egg white? A little bit of egg white mixed into the dough would help hold it together. Or maybe gelatin powder?\n\nIf it comes out too sticky, you need to roll the finished bars in some kind of powder you can eat. Can you tolerate a small amount of cocoa? Or maybe oat flour with a trace of cinnamon? Sesame seeds?\n\nAnyway, take these spitball ideas an play with them, you can have many happy hours in the kitchen experimenting.

It’s hard finding natural, simplistic ingredients that can cater towards natural hair individuals with inflammatory skin conditions, without having to pack all this shit onto our skin just to soothe a reaction. I absolutely adore the clarifying shampoo, natural acids combined with essential oils like tea tree and willow bark elevated my wash day experiences alongside routines.\n\nI truly believed that Cécred was revitalising my hair, when i was younger, my hair used to be crazy dense to the point i’d have to thin it out with shears because it was “giving me headaches” (it wasn’t). Now that I’m older, my hairs gotten curlier and less dense (i’m delusional) but I’ve figured out that my hair is just fine to medium but there’s so much of it where i’d had assumed my hair was course but it wasn’t.\n\nI was optimistic about cécred, it was making my hair course, thickening my hair so much to the point where I struggled to see my own scalp. However, it wasn’t until about 1-2 months in, when it all started going down hill. Maybe I wasn’t sustaining the protein/moisture balance? My hairs medium porosity, I assumed it was high because it would lose moisture quite quickly and remain dry after day 3. I wash my hair every 3-4 days because of my scalp condition producing more oil than usual. My hair started falling out rapidly, not handfuls of hair in my hand, but overtime i noticed more and more hairs accumulating within my hands after my wash days.\n\nI stopped using cécred as I got a big scare from it, my hair thinned out and my scalp became more visible afterwards. It’s been 9 months and my hair is now only returning back to its normal density (with the help of nizoral too, don’t like hair oils)\n\nAfter exploring and searching for hours, I came to the conclusion that maybe it was Cécred or my routines. Maybe I wasn’t deep conditioning enough, or for not as long as I should be (usually 5-10 mins cuz some of my strands are also fine so don’t wanna weigh it down)\n\nI started studying cécred ingredients. Bio-active keratin alongside hydrolysed rice protein is what cécred utilise within their shampoos, masks, etc. Furthermore, these two particular ingredients are usually higher up on the ingredient list meaning it’s more prominent, which in simple terms means it will affect your hair as you continue to use it. Mind you, these are two proteins. Your hair naturally produces keratin, it’s what gives you your hair strands, your nails, eyelashes, etc. Depending on the thickness of them (fine, medium, course) is determined 99% by genetics and diet.\n\nIf you’re a fine hair girlie, and you’re consistently adding more protein into your routine, although it’s good, it will cause severe damage in the long run if you’re not retaining moisture alongside the protein. Hair porosity also comes into play with this^ Learnt it the hard way. Be careful when using cécred.\n\nCécred is packed with proteins that have a tendency of masking individuals hair over time to give off the illusion that it’s feeding, thickening and revitalising their hair, when in reality, it’s masking it with proteins that in the long run will eventually snap your hair off…?\n\nIt’s not thickening, it’s not “curing” your breakage, it’s just adding extra layers of protection to your strands, that soon enough, will introduce even more breakage.\n\nThis is just my experience, i’m not criticising, just stating some facts as I’ve not seen ANYONE converse about this. Maybe I might go back into using cécred, I still have the clarifying shampoo which I now use every 2-3 weeks.\n",

I’ve used topical stuff, a good daily washing regimen, tried multiple Ordinary products, etc. I acne has been mostly isolated to larger cystic breakouts on my forehead and temples, and occasionally around my nose.\n\nBack in April of this year, I did a food sensitivity test by sending in hair follicles and the results were incredibly revealing. I had always known that whey protein was a problem, and always assumed dairy was a culprit as well. Aside from eating too much sugar, I generally always ate pretty well, exercise regularly, and like my nutrition plans to support exercise.\n\nThe results of the food sensitivity test proved that whey and dairy (all forms of it) were problematic, but also revealed several other things were high sensitivity that I ate regularly: brown and white rice, black beans, wheat of any kind, various gluten foods, mushrooms, apples, cod, shrimp. I typically ate black beans and rice every day or every other day, because they are great carbs. \n\nOnce I had this information, I did some random elimination diets or tried to avoid certain things but gave myself a day on Saturday to consume things with wheat in them. I have a bunch of pizza, because that was a double edge sword of dairy and wheat. \n\nGuess what? When I cut wheat and dairy entirely, cut black beans and rice entirely, my skin cleared up in a week. When I avoided everything bad but splurged and had pizza on a Saturday, I luckily avoided any breakouts, possibly because it was such a one off event and not a regular thing building up in my body.\n\nNow I’m incredibly focused on looking at labels and making sure that nothing I eat has any form of rice or rice flour or rice protein, or any form of wheat or dairy. Luckily there’s decent non-dairy cheese. Rice is the only thing I can’t substitute, because wild rice is expensive and gross. I don’t miss black beans because I substitute with lentils and kidney beans. Luckily there is also a ton of great nondairy ice cream out there and it’s always satisfying.\n\nMy biggest frustration with modern dermatology, and I expect many of you have the same frustration, is that it wants to heal people from the outside in rather than from the inside out. Holistic treatment of acne is still on the fringe of dermatology, to the detriment of each of us who suffer at any age.\n\nSince figuring this all out, my skin has been completely clear for a month with no breakouts like I was used to experiencing. I have been happier than ever thanks to this.\n\nHere is the service I used for the food sensitivity test: https://checkmybodyhealth.com/us/",

I want to note I have not been anaphylactic but have had serious nervous system issues across respiratory, heart, brain, fatigue etc. ultimately, my flare ups leave me bed ridden but not life threatening. I have noticed improvements but wander if anyone can share their experiences once they are on full dose Cromolyn. Did they go back to a near normal diet? Do they still abide to the low histamine diet like I currently do on 3 ampules. Curious because I’d like to know what to expect when I work my way up to the full 8 doses. Thanks!",

    "body": "UPDATE:  It took awhile to locate the place in my 23andme results with the answer. It seems they just test one gene, not two. I don't have it. I just hate the vile weed!\n\nAs for my pernicketyness, I grew up in a family from the rural South during pre-factory farming times. Meat and fish/seafood were fresh, local, and compared to now, bursting with flavor. We often picked our own berries and grew tomatoes, sweet potatoes, green beans, and cucumbers, but most of what we ate came from small producers or neighbors who still grew and preserved their own food, even when we were living on the west coast. Unsalted butter and a little salt were all the seasoning we usually needed (except for tacos 😁).\n\nIMO, instead of cooking complicated dishes with extensive seasoning, we'd be better off spending that time and energy on growing food - IF the same varieties can be found and grown. Then again, it's not that simple. Until recent times, the answer to boredom was, by necessity, self supplied. It could not be bought. Everything was different. Everything.\n\n-----------\n\nI hate cilantro, but I cannot say that it tastes like soap to me. (It might eventually if I keep expecting it to, though 😁)\n\nMaybe I don't have The Gene? Is mine nature or nurture (DNA vs acquired distaste)?\n\nIs it possible for people without the genetic variation to hate cilantro just as much as those who do?\n\nDo my yecks fit the pattern? \n\n(1) HERBS/SPICES\nAside from cilantro, I also dislike fennel, anise, anything licorice like. Also cumin, coriander, caraway, curry, fenugreek. And some spice - maybe one of those - that is always noticeable in natural food stores. (M.O.M. stores with cafes must use it in everything.) Oregano can easily overpower me. I slowly learned to eat a wee bit of black pepper as well as fresh basil in SOME things, but could live without both.\n\n(2) PRODUCE\nI'm not a bit keen on celery, melon, mango, papaya and do not care for solo cucumber by itself (though the scent is lovely and I like pickles). Onion that's not fresh cut. Reconstituted lemon/lime juice. Any fruit that tastes the slightest bit green.\n\n(3) MAILLARD REACTION\nI LOATHE coffee (roasted bean), carob (roasted bean), toasted marshmallows, toasted meringue, cheez-its, fried egg with brown edges, omelets with brown parts, char on roasted vegetables, and meat that is more than gently reheated (though this may be due to a different reason). \n\n(4) LEGUMES/GRAINS.\nBuckwheat (tastes like plastic). Chick peas. Edamame. Undercooked wheat flour (pasta al dente). Most whole wheat bread has a  bitter aftertaste to me. Rice protein powder. Things made with pea protein (Ripple - milk alternative)\n\n(5) OTHER\nPepsi. Whey. Rice protein powder. Tuna with cheese. Potatoes with cheese. Eggs with cheese (except mild cheese in certain omelets, lightly). Fat that's not fresh or has been overheated (pork skins, Brazil nuts that aren't super fresh, \"off\" bites in roast pork, old olive oil, the rim of a plastic mayo jar even right after you open it)",

    "body": "I don’t necessarily know what “type” of rosacea I have, but my dermatologist simply called it “Acne Rosacea.” I have my flare ups from time to time and I wanted to share what’s worked for me lately. During my flare ups, my skin is super oily and I get lots of pustules and sebaceous filaments. I generally have larger pores, but they get super yucky in times of flare ups.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT an expert by any means. I just wanted to share these things because when I was first diagnosed with Rosacea, I was desperate for people to tell me what kinds of products they were using, because my skin was so sensitive to everything.\n\n1- Daily probiotic- I listened to a podcast once where a doctor was discussing rosacea. He theorized that part of the reason we get these flare ups is because of the gut biome being imbalanced. I find that a daily probiotic has helped immensely. When I’ve gone 3-5 days without the probiotic (due to forgetting to pick up another bottle) my digestive issues get crazy, and my skin takes weeks to recover. I’ve been using the Garden of Life brand for around a year, because my coworker who’s a nurse recommended the brand.\nLink: https://www.gardenoflife.com/products/our-probiotics/dr-formulated-probiotics-once-daily-womens-shelf-stable-vegetarian-capsules\n\n2- Cleanser- I don’t remember how I came across this one, but I’d seen the brand all over TikTok. At some point I saw someone recommend Beauty of Joseon for rosacea. This Green Plum Cleanser has been excellent. (For context, I do best with a gentle cleanser, and any soap with Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate causes my skin to go crazy.)\nLink: https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/green-plum-refreshing-cleanser\n\n3- Moisturizer- There’s a few I use. I’m really picky about my moisturizers because so many of them make my skin oily.\n\nSunscreen- I really like this Beauty of Joseon Rice + Probiotics sunscreen. I’m a little worried that it doesn’t seem to be on their website right now, but here’s a link:\nhttps://www.beautybay.com/p/beauty-of-joseon/relief-sun-rice-probiotics/?ctyid=us&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADuI9VnqzADs4PhCRQyDtmunNPiD4&gclid=Cj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzr0nLAab6eL-coRCJt1jCnalFFy86xo11Hq2Rt8C7V73f4UF-jV63YaAgygEALw_wcB\n\nGeneral moisturizer- My skin seems to really like this Avène Tolerance Control moisturizer. I’m able to find it at Walgreens.\nLink: https://www.aveneusa.com/collections/skin-recovery/tolerance-control-cream?_gl=1*1lpftgr*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzoJ6OK4vE4u2275LQUYmw7sG6l6hK-Alz29fJsDUhRCHJ-_Y_jXJpMaAjCaEALw_wcB&gbraid=0AAAAADSZREbH0hS_PegjXtp6-MF894GMW\n\nEmergency flare up moisturizer- When my skin is all messed up, I slap this on every night before bed and it helps so much. I can usually find it at Walgreens or Ulta. \nLink: https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/body/body-lotion/cicaplast-balm-b5-for-dry-skin-irritations-3606000437449.html?GeoRedirectOff&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD80ULeiHaQJIK_vwI1iuIRaO5adj&gclid=Cj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzok4Va0wRW45LpBoWxXWSSNIlMsjEmPwVfu-MKbRvziejvPB3pD7BsaAhITEALw_wcB\n\n4- Makeup. Right now I’m using Tarte Shape Tape concealer as my “foundation.” But the makeup I CANNOT survive without is this Neutrogena Shine Control Rice Protein powder.  I use it after I’m done putting on my makeup, and it really keeps my oiliness at bay! If they ever stop making it, I’ll probably combust.\nLink: https://www.neutrogena.com/products/makeup/neutrogena-shine-control-powder/6819600",

    "body": "I've been trying Huel out now for about a week now, so I thought I would leave a review as I haven't seen any others yet. I'm comparing Huel to Joylent and Queal as those are the powdered meals I have direct experience of. I'm based in the UK.\n\nDelivery was good, I got a dispatch notice the same day of ordering and the box arrived three days later. As an early customer I got a free t-shirt and shaker. I ordered a weeks worth, and it came it two large 1.74kg bags. Branding and packaging all looked great.\n\nIt is a very finely ground powder, more so I think than both Queal and Joylent. It theoretically should mix well but that is made some what more difficult by how much water is needed. Huel suggests four meals a day, and I think the reason for that is they also suggest 4 parts water to 1 part huel. I generally have a powdered meal twice a day with 150g for each meal. 150g + 600ml of water fills of all the shakers I have. You really need additional space to shake and mix it properly. Any less water than that and it is really, really thick and you'll need to eat it with a spoon. It would be much easier with a blender. It doesn't seem to thicken any more after preparing, unlike Joylent which thickens overnight. If you can mix it well the texture is very good.\n\nI feel quite full after eating, because of the increase of water. I'm hungry though in roughly the same time as Joylent / Queal - which isn't entirely surprising as it roughly the same calories.\n\nIf you prepare it and drink straight away it is very sweet, probably too sweet. My wife, who drinks mostly Joylent, didn't really like it. It also has a slight after taste (either the pea or brown rice protein I'm guessing). Left overnight the taste improves and the after taste does slightly too. It only comes in a vanilla flavour.\n\nProtein is a little high for my liking, I think I'd like to see that reduced and both carbohydrates and fats increased to compensate for the calories. \n\nPrice is high compared to both Joylent and Queal, I calculated it would be about £14 a week for Joylent and £23 for Huel. I understand they are higher quality ingredients, presumably the proteins. I have mild IBS and Joylent tends to set that off very slightly, Huel less so but probably not significantly.\n\nSo in general I liked it, I think the flavour could do with improving and I'd need a blender or a larger shaker to cope with mixing it. According to the website there is now a two week delay in delivery, so it would be interesting to see how this works out in terms of availability.\n\nI'd like to try Mana next, and Soylent of course once they bless us with delivery in the UK.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/y9CIpkr\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I immediately ordered some.\n\nThe product is fairly new to market and sold by Paca Foods in Sweden although it’s made in the Netherlands.\n\nI was immediately impressed with the simplicity of the ingredients, especially when you compare to other products like Rosa Food’s Soylent:\n\n>“Paca is made from a blend of **oat flour \\(gluten\\)**, maltodextrin, **soy flour**, pea protein, rice protein, sunflower oil, vitamin and mineral blend\\*, natural vanilla flavouring, sodium carbonate, xanthan gum \\(thickener\\), silica \\(anticoagulant\\), modified starch, rosemary extract \\(antioxidant\\) and sucralose \\(sweetener\\).”\n\nPaca Powder is sold by the 1\\-day 2000 kCal\\-ish bag. Prices range from €7,50 to €6 per bag depending on quantity purchased and shipping is free.  It comes in Vanilla only.\n\nTogether with my order of 5 bags, I received a free shaker, free scoop, lots of free stickers and the coolest handwritten letter from Alexander, the founder of Paca Foods.  I literally ran around to everyone I could find to show them the cool letter.\n\nThe bags are easy and straightforward to open, with a plastic zipper “zip loc” style top, inside the powder looks very fine and you are immediately greeted with a lovely vanilla aroma.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63w6brih9gu01.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583b1916a4062285f7fefa27d8367bcdc27e13a\n\nWhen preparing, I added extra water to get the consistency I wanted, and would say that it is smoother than Jimmy Joy’s Plenny Shake or Huel.  It’s about the same smoothness as MANA. But not quite at the same level as Soylent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ews4z7uj9gu01.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=0835cbbfa37a9fef0d10e52d038e654da413d960\n\nIt tastes sweet, and clearly of vanilla, but more natural than Jimmy Joy’s Plenny Shake vanilla.  It wasn’t so sweet or so vanilla\\-y that it felt difficult to get through a whole 700 kCal meal.\n\nOverall I would definitely buy this product again and see it as a welcome newcomer with a very unique taste profile.\n\nOh, and I should mention I have no connection to the company and paid for the product with my own money.  I will not receive any compensation for this review.\n\nLink: [https://pacafood.com/](https://pacafood.com/)",

    "body": "For anyone who is on the fence about these products, I honestly can't recommend them enough.\n\n**My history** (skip forward to review if you want):\n\nI was an early fan of Soylent and follower as Rob started the movement and watched it blow up, extremely excited about nutrition optimization and finally bought Soylent (pre-bottled, probably 1.0?) a long time ago, but I immediately absolutely loved the flavor and started drinking almost nothing but it.\n\nI began to experience weird symptoms and ultimately had to stop. At the time I thought it was something with my heart but I got EKG and everything and everything came out normal, but when I stopped drinking the Soylent I was fine.\n\nI did some Mealsquares for a while and they are honestly amazing but the shelf life is poor, they take up a lot of room in the freezer, and they haven't been able to scale and bring the price down.\n\nFast forward to today. I figured out separate from Soylent a couple years ago that it seems that I don't necessarily have heart issues, it seems to be bad acid reflux / heartburn that I sometimes get triggered by specific foods. Coffee and tomatoes being the biggest culprits, but I wondered if that similar episode years ago with Soylent was due to heart burn / acid reflux (at the time we thought it must have been a salt thing or a dehydration thing).\n\n**Review**:\n\nSo earlier this month I bought every flavor of powdered Plenny Active and Huel 3.0. My reasoning for going protein-heavy formula with Plenny but normal formula for Huel was that I like the idea of the zero maltodextrin in each company's respective high-protein blend but I didn't want to only drink high-protein blend, I think the ratio of macros would mean too much protein if you ever want 24/7 and happened to only have these 'active'/'black' blends. And regular Huel already has extremely limited sugar content so I went with that for the regular.\n\nMy body seems to be doing great on them (using them for about 1/2 to 2/3 of calories for a couple weeks to see if I have any issues).\n\nI got my Huel first, it shipped in just a few days. I immediately tried the unflavored/unsweetened and was a little disappointed. It tasted less like oatmeal (which I eat often) and more like drinking some thick nothing with occasional big balls of raw tasteless flour that made your tongue revolt due to the dryness.\n\nI was a little worried.\n\nBut then I tried vanilla and wow it tastes absolutely amazing. Basically tastes exactly like drinking the cake batter flavor of frozen yogurt. I can deal with the balls of flour by doing what others have suggested and letting it sit overnight which seems to not completely remove the balls but at least gives the water more time to seep in and prevent them from having that disgusting dry-chalk-grit explosion when you bite into them.\n\nObviously if I had a blender this would be a non-issue and I'm actively considering buying an immersion blender.\n\nThe other flavors were better than unflavored. Berry is OK. Wouldn't it call strawberry which is my favorite berry. It covers up the raw flavors of the flour alright but isn't something I would yearn for the way the vanilla was. Chocolate is pretty bizarre and I can't say I'm a fan. It tastes to me like taking a tablespoon of Hershey's chocolate syrup and putting in an 8 oz glass of plain water and mixing it up.\n\nThe flavor boosts to my tongue are a little bizarre and a little weak (the single serving sample packets). I'm not a big of Stevia based products generally which is unfortunate given they seem to be better than Sucralose. But at least Huel  (even the sucralose ones) seems to have the least grams of sugar (or sweeteners) compared to Plenny, Mana, or Hol Foods (which I wanted to buy to test until I saw their sugar levels).\n\nThen the Plenny came.\n\nFirst taste of unflavored, I was a little scared after tasting it because it seemed to have a very unpleasant aftertaste. Worse than the taste of Huel unflavored (if you were to blend and avoid the balls of dry raw flour).\n\nOne note, the Plenny Active bags have been entirely impossible for me to reseal whereas the Huel bags are extremely easy to reseal. I didn't use scissors or anything weird to open them, I used the perforations to pull/rip the top open and the two parts you'd expect to seal the bag are there but just seem to be worthless. If anyone has tips I'd love them. Otherwise I need to buy large containers.\n\nBut at least it shakes up entirely smooth with just a few seconds of shaking and no need to chill in the fridge.\n\nAnd the flavored versions were great. The vanilla is actually extremely similar to my tongue to the Huel 3.0 vanilla. The banana I expected to love as I love both natural and fake tasting banana flavors, and it was a bit weaker / less sweet than I expected but after trying it a couple times I love it and glad it provides a good way to mix things up. Strawberry also is quite great. Not as good as vanilla but once again nice to have the variety. Strawberry Plenny Active tastes much more like the 'berry' flavor I expected in my head than Berry Huel 3.0. I haven't tried the Chai Latte yet, it's still sitting unopened.\n\nI've been testing what ratio of unflavored to flavored I can use in a mix and 1 scoop of Plenny Strawberry is adequate to cover up 2 scoops of Plenny unflavored or Huel unflavored. Plenny Banana is the same. I think the vanilla for both Huel and Plenny is so strong and tasty that I can probably get away with 1 scoop of Plenny vanilla with 3 scoops of Huel or Plenny unflavored, ditto for Huel vanilla.\n\nAs far as other factors, Huel is definitely more satiating and makes me feel fuller, Huel also gave me more problems with gas and bloating initially (both seem well tolerated now), and Plenny Active wins for mixability and smoothness. I think for me I will land on buying some of each, to hedge against any risks of missing unknown micros in either formulation (and to hedge against any downsides of chronic soy intake).\n\n**My Overall Ranking:**\n\n1. Huel or Plenny Active Vanilla (tie).\n2. Plenny Active Strawberry.\n3. Plenny Active Banana.\n4. Huel Berry.\n5. Huel Chocolate.\n6. Huel unflavored.\n7. Plenny unflavored.\n\nFor anyone thinking about buying some of these products, I highly recommend it. And if you were on the fence about what flavors you might like, if you typically like cake batter flavored froyo or icecream, to my taste buds the vanilla in these two products tastes basically exactly like that. Banana Plenny Active is very mild and not very sweet but the flavor is decent. I've never been as big of a chocolate candy person as I have been a fan of other types of candy or cake (besides chocolate + nuts which I love like Snickers or Reeses), but I figured I should try all of the flavors in case I didn't do it and then 5 years later after eating vanilla learn I missed out on a great flavor.\n\nWell, if you're like me just don't even bother risking it with chocolate. It doesn't taste like chocolate candy. Just weird watered down chocolate. And you're not missing much. Idk about you but if you water down lemonade you get lemonwater. I like lemonwater. If you water down strawberry you would expect to get strawberry water. To me strawberry water is still decent. It's no strawberry milk or icecream, but it's OK. Ditto for banana, and ditto for vanilla (altho the vanilla flavors are actually not really that watered down to my tongue). But would you ever think to yourself I could really go for a chocolatewater right now? To me it's very strange. If you wanna start with a small order just get unflavored and vanilla so you can taste the difference between the healthy option and the cake flavored option, and if you can handle the healthy one then going forward you can just order more unflavored and if you can't stomach it you'll definitely be able to if you mix it with flavored. And then you can try other flavors later on.\n\n**What's next:**\n\nI wanna try Super Body Fuel's Super Fuel because it's zero maltodextrin and seems even more reduced / atomic / pure than Huel, the only reason I didn't order it in the first place was it seemed to have a close ingredient profile to Huel, and I wanted to try the two different options with more varied ingredient lists (since Huel and SBF are Oat and Rice Protein and Flax (Huel additionally Pea protein and a small amount of Maltodextrin), whereas Plenny Active was a bit further apart (Oat + Soy, No maltodextrin).\n\nI considered Hol Foods (Rice, Whey, Milk, no maltodextrin) but 10g cane sugar is honestly more sugar than I already eat in my normal non-meal-replacement diet. Ditto Mana which has an everything and the kitchen sink approach to protein/carb sources which I guess is cool but also has 7g of sugar.",

    "body": "Hey everyone, axcho here. I started out as [a DIYer](https://diy.soylent.com/users/axcho) and started selling my own mixes, first on the [Soylent forum](https://discourse.soylent.com/t/anyone-selling-their-diy/12910/2?u=axcho), then at [Custom Body Fuel](http://custombodyfuel.com/blog/), and now at actual real company [Super Body Fuel](http://superbodyfuel.com/blog/).\n\nNow that we've finally caught up with our backlog ([yay!](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/)) I've got some time to dust off a few projects I've had to put on the back burner. One of those is my idea for **Super Protein**.\n\nAs you may know, we've made our vitamin and mineral blend ([Super Micros](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-micros/)) and electrolyte blend ([Super Electrolytes](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-electrolytes/)) available at discounted prices to DIYers, along with our ketogenic fat and fiber mix ([Super Fiber](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-fiber/)). This makes it really easy to create your own DIY recipe - just add the carb, protein, and fat sources of your choice, and you have a nutritionally complete shake.\n\nThere are a lot of great options for protein out there, but not a lot of great options that are both *complete* (or rather, well balanced in terms of amino acid profile) and *hypoallergenic*, not to mention also tasting reasonably good. I see a niche potentially worth filling with a hypoallergenic, complete protein mix: **Super Protein**\n\nHere's what I'm thinking:\n\n* 100g of protein per day (or 25g per serving), from hypoallergenic **organic brown rice protein**, plus vegan **lysine** (an amino acid which rice protein is a little low in)\n* A little **xanthan gum** to improve the texture and prevent the powder from settling at the bottom when mixed with water\n* Some added **cellulose** for insoluble fiber, to prevent constipation\n* Sold for **$3.00** a day, or essentially $0.03 per gram of protein, in units of **$30.00** for a 10-day supply (1000g of protein)\n\nThat's cheaper than or comparable to most of the rice protein you can find on Amazon, plus it's complete (with lysine) and has a better taste and texture than a lot of the stuff you'd buy online as well.\n\nIf you combine a serving of Super Protein with a serving of Super Fiber, Super Electrolytes, and Super Fiber, you'd essentially get [Keto Fuel Plain](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/keto-fuel/?flavor=plain), at a price of $6 a day or less.\n\nHowever, you could also just use whey protein or something instead of this, if you wanted. So I don't know how much demand there would be for this.\n\n**So, what do you all think?** :) Would you want to buy it? What do you think of the price point, and the quantity? How about the extra ingredients? Anything you'd add or remove?\n\nLet me know and we'll make it happen! ;) Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\n---\n\n**Update:** Just released [Super Protein](http://superbodyfuel.com/shop/super-protein/) and posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/8l5gu8/new_schmilk_flavor_and_super_protein_now/)! :)",

I'm already a happy customer of your Super DIY products.\n\nI explored vegan protein sources and settled on soy protein isolate because most other products contained a significant amount of iron.\n\ne.g. a 30g scoop of rice protein isolate from [TrueNutrition](https://truenutrition.com/p-1102-rice-protein-concentrate-non-gmo-1lb.aspx) has 25&#37; of your iron RDI, and this adds up fast and is combined with Super Micros to \\>200&#37;, for me, at least\n\nCan you comment on how you'd accomodate for the iron content? Do you think it's not worth worrying about a 40ug daily iron dose?\n\nAlso, are you aware of any vegan hypoallergenic sources of faster\\-digesting protein? Broscience holds that fast\\-digesting protein like whey isolate is better after exercise than slow\\-digesting protein like soy or rice or casein. Myself \\- I like to mix casein and whey for my recipe \\- even though it's surely only giving marginal benefits.\n\nWould you offer flavored protein? Or consider just selling Super Flavors™  separately? I mentioned soy protein isolate earlier \\- when I bought it, I'd get it unflavored and add [TrueNutrition's flavor powders](https://truenutrition.com/tn-flavor-packs.aspx) to my recipe. \\(ultimately, it wasn't tasty or smooth enough for me so I went back to flavored ON whey and casein. maybe you could do a better job.\\)\n\nSpeaking of TrueNutrition, just for additional comparison, they offer rice protein for about 2.4 cents per gram. I'm not particularly motivated by Super Protein's cellulose, but if you can make it taste and mix well, I'd buy from you.\n\nAnd mentioning cellulose \\- would you modify the Super Fiber formula or prescribe using less to account for Super Protein's fiber?",

Leucine is big right now as being considered the key amino acid that signals the body to grow muscle.  [Here](http://www.nutritiontactics.com/measure-muscle-protein-synthesis/#73_Leucine) and [here](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/athlete-protein-intake/) are two articles that include a discussion about leucine.

    "body": "Hello everyone! This is my review of u/axcho’s Athlete Fuel in Plain and Vanilla flavors. Full disclaimer: I was sent a sample of this product for only the cost of shipping, but **I want to make it clear that u/axcho did not send me this sample with any agreement that I would review it on this sub.  This review was something I decided to do on my own and without his input.**  As always, I am going to be 100% honest and accurate in this review without regard to the fact that I received the sample for a discounted rate.  I have previously reviewed Nutberg in a much similar fashion, which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/4scpj8/my_detailed_review_of_nutberg_2016_formula/), and PrimalKind 1.2, which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/4wrtqs/my_detailed_review_of_primalkind_12_2016/).\n\nNotes about me: 6'1, 200 lb male, living in California. I have been a vegan for 8 years (on ethical grounds, not nutritional), and a vegetarian for 7 years before that. My primary interests (as they relate to soylent products) are sustainability and nutrition. Price, taste, and texture are all concerns, but they take a back-burner to environmental and nutritional considerations for me. Prior to sampling AthleteFuel, I have tried DIY soylent, Soylent 1.4, Soylent 1.5, Soylent 2.0, Hol Food, Nutberg 2016, and PrimalKind 1.2. Since I am in the USA, this will be a US-centric review with regards to pricing, shipping times, etc. Now, on to the product!\n\nFirst, [here in an Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/gKA9j) with some pics of the packaging and product (before and after mixing).\n\n**Shipping:** U/axcho actually shipped the order *three hours* after I had placed it.  I had been in contact with him earlier in the morning, so perhaps that is why he was so quick with the shipping.  Either way, I am not saying my results will or will not be typical, but that the turnaround time for my order was very quick.  The package arrived 3 days after I received a shipping notification.   Since that is coming from northern CA down to southern CA, this seems like a moderate shipping time.  I honestly expected shipping to be a bit faster, but USPS tends to take their time these days with anything that isn’t an Amazon order.\n\n**Package condition:** Great, the sample shipped in a flat rate USPS box and was sealed with extra tape for a bit of extra security.  The Athlete Fuel packets inside were totally untouched and undamaged.\n\n**Food safety:** I have seen some pictures on the Super Body Fuel site of their facility and it does appear to be clean and well-organized.  I know that USDA/FDA laws are fairly stringent about food safety, so personally I am not too worried about the risk of contamination or mold, especially since this is a powdered product and not a liquid.\n\n**Price:** For a standard order (20 meals, AKA 5 days @ 1320 calories per day), Athlete Fuel is currently selling for $50 USD plus $10 shipping. If you buy a month's worth, the cost is $300 plus $20 shipping.  This comes out to be just under $11 per day. However, this does not include the additional milk you will need to buy to complete the nutritional profile of the product.  With this pricing, I would consider Athlete Fuel a mid-cost product.  The pricing is definitely higher than some of the main soylent competitors (especially Soylent and Joylent). However, if you are comparing it to other products that serve a specialized market (ketogenic-type and/or high-protein-type products), it seems fairly priced.  I assume most of the cost comes from the high protein content, the specialized vitamin mix, and the fact that u/axcho is a much smaller supplier than Rosa Labs or Joylent.  Depending on how much you pay for your choice of milk, this could be a moderately-priced diet, or a very expensive one.  My milk choice is unsweetened soy milk, which runs $6/gallon.  For those that buy organic milk, the cost will be similar, but for those that buy the discount/cheapo milk, you may only be looking at half that price or less.\n\n**Smell:**\n\n*Plain, Dry:* It smells just like oat flour and rice protein, similar to what white flour smells like.\n\n*Vanilla, Dry:* A floury smell just like the Plain flavor, but with an obvious hint of vanilla and sweetness.\n\n*Plain, Wet:* Pretty much the same smell\n\n*Vanilla, Wet:* Pretty much the same smell\n\n**Color:**\n\n*Plain/Vanilla:* Off-white (sometimes called bone white).\n\n**Texture:**\n\n*Plain/Vanilla, Dry:* The texture was very smooth, much smoother than my experience with store-bought rice protein powder, and just as smooth as Soylent 1.5.  Very similar in texture to white flour.\n\n*Plain/Vanilla, each 42g serving shaken with 1 cup soy milk:* Using a shaker cup, blending was almost instantaneous, but with a thicker result than Soylent 1.5. The texture was very smooth, and I didn’t notice any settling during my testing, although I did not let the products sit for very long.  Personally, I would add either some water or ice to help thin out the mixture a bit, but that’s easy enough to change to suit your preference.\n\n**Taste:**\n\n*Plain:* I should note that the Super Body Fuel site clearly explains that the Plain flavor has a flavor that many people might not enjoy, since it is entirely unsweetened.  After trying Nutberg (which is also unsweetened), I wasn’t too worried about the warning, so I tried it anyway.  The product tasted like unsweetened salty oatmeal.  I personally didn’t mind the lack of sweetness, but the biggest challenge with the Plain flavoring option was simply the saltiness.  Overall, I personally thought the flavor was fine, although I can see why the other flavoring options are generally recommended.  However, if you were looking for a savory option, this would definitely suit your needs.\n\n*Vanilla:* Now, for me, this version of the product was very sweet.  Sweeter than Soylent 1.5, and perhaps on the same level as Hol Food (although without the chocolate flavor obviously).  The way is would describe it is: have you ever had the Quaker breakfast oatmeal packets you get at the store?  The ‘maple cinnamon’ or ‘apple cinnamon’ or ‘berries and cream’ packets?  The sweetness would be like blending one of those packets into a cup of milk.  This option was definitely too sweet for me, but for those with a sweet tooth, it might be perfect.  I will say, the sweetness did make it very easy to finish a serving, but I would be concerned about wanting to drink too much of the product with how easy it is to gulp down.\n\n*Plain+Vanilla:* For my final test, I decide to make a 50/50 blend of the Vanilla and Plain flavors.  For me, this option was perfect.  Just mildly sweet, mildly salty, and with a vanilla oat/rice finish.  Personally, this is the flavoring ratio I would use in the future.  It adds a bit of hassle to mix the two flavor options together, but it’s not a big deal if you are making a larger batch, since you can just throw two baggies together into your container and go.\n \n**Satiety:**\n\nI was not hungry 3+ hours after my servings. I think the high amount of protein and good amount of fiber helped keep me full, and perhaps the low glycemic effect was helpful as well. However, I am not someone who gets hungry easily, so it's hard to get a good judgement from just a few servings.\n\n**Nutrition:**\n\nNUTRITIONAL DISCLAIMER: Nutritional science is ever-evolving and always in dispute. There is good and bad science supporting and dismissing many different nutritional principles and ideologies. Each person has to do their own research and decide what they believe for themselves. I personally am a big fan of large epidemiological studies, as well as metabolic ward studies and R+DB+PC studies. I have come to some conclusions that many others here have not, and that's OK. Particularly, I don't believe that food science is at a point where we know exactly all of the ingredients that are optimal for health and lifespan, and I still believe that a whole foods approach is a healthier option. I support products like Soylent because I like their vision of sustainability and their goals of progressing food science and of making a perfect food. I just don't think they are there yet. I will try to link to some of my supporting evidence in the paragraphs below, but frankly I'm not here to start any battles. I am simply trying to share my thoughts on Athlete Fuel and what I believe to be the pros and cons of the product with regards to modern nutrition.\n\n**Ingredients:** The product is primarily oat flour, rice protein powder, various fibers, and vitamins/minerels/flavoring.  It is high-protein, vegan, and gluten-free.  The brown rice protein is organic, but from my understanding, the total product is not organic or GMO-free.\n\n**Protein:**\n\n*Quantity:* Very high in protein (128 grams per 4 servings). I'm not a huge protein fiend, but I do think a plant-based diet requires slightly more protein than the standard RDA due to the decreased digestibility and [PDCAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Digestibility_Corrected_Amino_Acid_Score) of plant proteins. My personal ideal body-weight (according to BMI) is around 80 kg (176 lbs, 6'1 male). With a 1320 calorie serving plus my choice of milk (8 grams protein per cup), that works out to 160 total grams, or nearly 1 g/lb.  The US RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg or 0.36 g/lb, while bodybuilders and power-lifters tend to shoot closer to 2.2 g/kg (1 g/lb). Personally I believe that the RDA is too low for many groups (the elderly, vegans, the sick/malnourished), but I also believe that 1 g/lb is [definitely excessive](http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/).  Athlete Fuel is on the high end of this spectrum, so people looking to gain muscle mass, those on large weight deficits, or those that are simply supplementing a regular diet with Athlete Fuel will probably appreciate the high protein content.  If you are replacing all of your diet and not in one of the aforementioned groups, definitely look for a lower-protein option.  The Super Body Fuel site also has a well-reviewed product called Schmilk that could fit your needs.\n\n*Quality:* The protein in Athlete Fuel has a good amino acid score, primarily because u/axcho has done the legwork and fortified the rice protein with additional lysine, which rice protein is naturally low in (most grains are lysine-limited).  I did not see a place on the Super Body Fuel site that listed the specific amino acid breakdown of Athlete fuel, but I believe /u/axcho has done the proper work to ensure that this is an ‘amino complete’ product.  The digestibility of rice protein is generally lower than whey, but since the protein has been so thoroughly powdered, and simply because the product has so much protein per serving, I would not be worried about the digestibility score.\n\n**Carbs:**\n\n*Quantity:* This is a lower-carb product, with each serving containing 30 net carbs.  This is not marketed as a ketogenic-friendly product, since 4 servings would be 120 net carbs per day, and keto dieters tend to stay near 20-50 grams per day of net carbs.  My thoughts on carbs are that the quality (starches, fibers, sugars) is generally more important than the quantity.  With that being said, many people have had great success with weight loss on lower-carb diets (/r/keto is filled with success posts).  I think a lower-carb product can help with blood sugar regulation and reducing insulin spikes.\n\n**Fiber:**\n\n*Quantity:* 32 grams per 4 servings.  Like most soylents out there, this a product with much more fiber than Rosa Labs Soylent.  I heard stories of people complaining about the gas effects from paltry amounts of fiber in 1.4, so in 1.5 the fiber was reduced even further, which is frankly a nutritionally bad idea. There is more and more evidence that [humans evolved on high fiber diets](https://michaellustgarten.wordpress.com/2015/07/17/on-a-paleo-diet-not-if-you-fiber-intake-is-less-than/), and those with high fiber intakes have [better health outcomes](https://michaellustgarten.wordpress.com/2014/08/02/is-dietary-fiber-associated-with-reduced-mortality/) than those with lower intakes. Fiber is now being shown to be essential for maintaining a healthy gut (and a [healthy body overall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOZcbNw7sng)) by feeding our gut bacteria.  The fiber was increased in Soylent 1.6, but not to the level of Athlete Fuel.\n\n*Quality:* The nutrition panel doesn't actually give a breakdown of the types of fiber in Athlete Fuel, but the main ingredients all contain a mix of soluble and insoluble fibers. Both fibers are important for health (insoluble adds bulk and helps pass stool while soluble feeds our gut bacteria).\n\n**Sugar:**\n\n*Quantity:* Athlete Fuel is a nearly sugar-free product.  From what I can see, monk fruit (calorie free, similar to stevia) is the primary sweetener. I don’t know if u/axcho has done any research on the glycemic load of the product, but with the lack of sugar, lower amounts of carbs, and the higher amount of fiber, I would expect this product to have a low GL value compared to Soylent/Joylent.\n\n**Fats:**\n\n*Quantity/Quality:* 20 grams per 4 servings, 4 grams SFAs, ~? grams PUFA's.  By itself, the product is low in saturated fats.  However, if used with cow’s milk like most people will, then the saturated fats are higher than are currently recommended by most nutritional governing bodies.  However, the negative effects of SFA's are partially mediated by cholesterol and refined carbs in the diet, which this product has none of. Overall, I wouldn't worry much about the saturated fats, especially if you are active. With regards to the PUFA's, there is no information provided about the quantity or ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fats.  All of the omega-3 fats would come in the form of ALA fats, and there are no added EPA/DHA fats.  Even if all the omega-3 fats are ALA, [research indicates](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/92/5/1040.full) that even those with a zero intake of EPA/DHA still have similar levels of those fatty acids in their blood when compared with EPA/DHA consumers. The general thought is that the body becomes better at converting ALA to EPA/DHA when the dietary intake of EPA/DHA is low, whereas if you are getting EPA/DHA in the diet then your body won't bother converting as much. Overall I would be glad if there was actual DHA in the product, but I also don't feel that it's strictly necessary.  I am not familiar enough with the omega composition of cow’s milk and/or soy milk to determine how much of an issue this could be over time.\n\n**Micronutrients:**\n\nThis section could take me hours to type up, but this review is already long so I will try to be succinct. My thoughts on the 'optimal' levels of vitamins and minerals generally come from health outcomes measured in large epidemiological studies. Obviously these studies can have flaws, but I think looking at large population groups (and correctly controlling for variables) is a good way to what quantities of different nutrients are optimal. For some analysis of micronutrients and optimal dosing, see some of the blog posts on [this site](https://michaellustgarten.wordpress.com/category/diet-and-mortality/).\n\nWhat I like: First, let me say that I know from experience that u/axcho has done good research and has chosen very bio-available forms of the vitamins and minerals in Athlete Fuel.  The product has above-RDA values for many vitamins and minerals that modern Americans are often deficient in. Additionally, many of these are vitamins where the RDA is a little low, so it's nice to see a bit of an excess above 100% for these nutrients.  Note that this product is purposely deficient in calcium since it is intended to be mixed with fortified milks.  If you take this product only with water you **will not** get enough calcium in your diet, so make sure your milk is calcium-fortified or that it naturally contains enough calcium for your needs.\n\nWhat I don't like: Honestly, I can think of very few improvements that could be made from a micronutrient standpoint. Personally I would like to see an increase in the potassium level.  I also asked /u/axcho about the choline and manganese levels in the product, and his response was: “Choline is in our mix as well, but the Nutrition Facts label is not allowed to show choline. Manganese is no longer supplemented, and comes from oat flour and rice protein which contain widely varying amounts depending on the crop, so I've chosen to leave it off the label. Same with phosphorus.”\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR Conclusion:** I really like Athlete Fuel. Overall this looks to be a healthy, high-protein, lower-carb, higher-fiber meal replacement. You get a vegan food that is tasty, but without the work of going to the store, preparing the ingredients, cooking, and ensuring your diet has a balanced profile of macro and micronutrients. The texture is very smooth.  Having a DIY background and experience with 'gritty' ingredients like rice protein, the texture really surprised me with its smoothness.  For flavor, I really enjoyed a 50/50 blend of the Plain and Vanilla flavors, and it was easy to drink an entire serving.  I didn’t care much for the Plain on it’s own (since it was quite salty), or the Vanilla on it’s own (since it was very sweet), but the blend solved all my concerns.  From a nutritional perspective, I think this product has a great profile.  The protein levels are higher than most people need (remember, this is called *Athlete* Fuel for a reason).  The fiber levels are good and the glycemic load is likely moderately low (acceptable for diabetics or those with blood sugar concerns).  Nutritionally, Athlete Fuel is very low in food allergens and is vegan-friendly as the same time.  It also comes with the benefit of choice, since you can decide which milk fits your lifestyle and go from there.  I like the attention to detail with regards to the amino acid balance and the focus on optimizing vitamin and mineral levels.  Regarding the price, I am a budget-conscious consumer so I would like to see a cheaper option (maybe another larger order option that comes with a discounted price?), but I understand the costs involved and I definitely don’t think u/axcho is pricing the product unfairly.  Currently the product is a similar price to Soylent 2.0, but I also understand that it’s filling a very different space in the market that 2.0 isn’t, so I would hesitate to compare them directly on price.\n\nThat's it. I hope you enjoyed the review! I can answer any questions anyone has about Athlete Fuel or about my thought processes.",

The vitamin mix is such a small fraction of the cost, honestly, that it really doesn't matter much. Which is a great reason to use the best possible vitamin mix you can get, instead of skimping there. ;)",

If its just you and your friends using it then you can do whatever, but even if you only want to sell it at a farmer's market you'll need to consider some things:\n\n- does the powder provide a complete amino profile? Do you need to put any extra ingredients in besides the proteins and flavorings so that its a quality product? Do you know where these ingredients are sourced from and that they are 100% allergen free and vegan?\n- many people are concerned with heavy metal levels in some brands of protein. Will you test for this?\n- how will you guarantee there is consistency between batches, especially if you're producing in small volumes and not buying large amounts of raw ingredients at once?\n- you're selling people a mysterious powder, one that they could likely make themselves given that you appear to have a pretty simple ingredient list. How do they know they can trust you? Why should they pick your product?\n- how will you package the powder? If you want people to trust you you can't just put it in a ziploc. You will need containers and branding, which gets expensive.\n\nI don't mean to discourage you; if you like working out and dietary science I think you could have a real future making products and starting a supplement company. But I do want to be realistic with you as lots of people have tried to do the same before. Ultimately you are gonna be the best endorsement for your products, so you should keep innovating and get mad shredded, cuz then people will know it works and you will have more success on social media.",

(I'm 5'5\") This has been SO frustrating. I finally got diagnosed with SIBO (hydrogen and methane) about 2 weeks ago. Started the protocol a week ago. The supplements cause terrible diarrhea so I lost MORE weight! And the SIBO diet which I just started is so limiting. Plus, fatty things like coconut milk, avocado and nuts cause a bad reaction in terms of histamines. The nerves in my stomach go crazy, and I get zaps into my head, as well. (Brain-gut connection)  I've been looking for a good protein powder supplement to have between meals to try to gain weight. I can't do Whey or Seeds like Hemp, Chia and Flax.  So that leaves Pea Protein and Brown Rice Protein. I don't feel so great with those either. Has anyone had this type of difficulty? And if so, what did you do????",

Its specifically made for people who can only drink their meals for nutrition. Many use the elemental diet to get 75 to 80 percent reduction in sibo, by just drinking that for 2 -3 weeks. Its completely allergen free, and basically the stuff you need to survive. You just calculate how many scoops you need a day to satisfy calories and space the shakes out through the day. I just did 2 weeks of it and it kept me alive and I didn't lose but 5 pounds. Dr. Michael Ruscio makes a elemental diet powder too, check it out. Hope that helps.",

Wanted to make morning protein breakfast drinks to supplement my workout, I'm trying to cut out dairy from my diet for ethical reasons and because I'm pretty lactose intolerant so wanted to avoid whey. Been aggressively lurking here and decided to follow folks advice and make a pea / brown rice protein 50-50 mix. Ordered the 2.5kg sacks of each from one of those black Friday deals, and wasn't prepared for how much I got! Looking forward to integrating it! Initial plan will involve nut milk, almonds, hemp hearts, and fruit, and go from there! \n\nDo these go bad? Any storage tips? Don't want to watch my investment go bad! Anyone have any favorite combinations they like?",

I had unmanageable gastrointestinal side effects on 1.0 so now my doctor has me at 0.75. At this dose, I have very little appetite and get full easily on very little food (which is the point, I know :) but that makes it hard to get enough protein.\n\nI'm also a vegetarian, and have an intolerance for lactose and whey. I am able to eat eggs daily and I have a rice protein powder that I use daily, but even with that, I'm not coming close to where I need to be on protein.\n\nAny suggestions on manageable ways to intake more? Thanks in advance!",
