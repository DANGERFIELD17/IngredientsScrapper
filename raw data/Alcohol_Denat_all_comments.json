It started spinning for a few seconds and once it picked up full speed the loose chuck launched out of the lathe barely missing the student using it and flew across the room colliding with the teachers head who was helping out another student at the time. The teacher was knocked unconscious and suffered brain damage from the injury. Since then he has only be working part time and has trouble with speech and coordination. The student got suspended but that was the only punishment he received for giving the teacher a life long disability. \n\nBy the way the teacher is very very light hearted about it and has always been a positive guy.

It seems like, at least in England, virtually everyone would be expected to have their meals with an alcoholic drink, including children, but if fresh water was available and they were thirsty at other times they would drink water. Drinking water with meals was something the rich would do in cities, who could afford to have drinking water pipes to their homes. The wikipedia article on ‚Äòsmall beer‚Äô, the porridge-like beer mediaeval people drank is well-cited https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer\n\nTo get more to the point on this: it‚Äôs hard to say really if people drank beer because it was ‚Äòmore sanitary‚Äô or not, as it seems largely people both preferred beer with meals, and water was more expensive. If people did benefit from this in a sanitary sense, it wouldn‚Äôt really be a conscious decision as much as the done thing of the time.",

So I was glad that I wouldn't have to make a trip to the hardware store to get some pre-stain to condition the wood if I just mix together these things that I have in stock. Seemed like it should work in theory, so I decided to go with it.\n\nWhy this is an issue is because the thing I'm constructing is made out of rando scraps and laminated boards. So the stain will go all sorts of goofy blotchy nutso with the dissimilar woods/layers. Which might look shitty. The pre-stain will prevent the real stain from going too deep and making a mess. \n\nIt seems to be working thus far. It needs a few more coats of color to be sure.",

Though, to be fair, one corner will be where the metal lathe, mill, and horizontal bandsaw live, so it won't all be for wood.\n\n> Our shopsmith is an old Mark V.\n\nSo random ShopSmith history lesson.  The original model was made by Magna Engineering and was the brain child of Hans Goldschmidt.  The first model was the 10e (experimental.)  It was refined with the 10er (experimental, revised.)  And I mispoke above: mine is from '48.  I don't think the first SS was released until '46?.  The first Mark V came out in 1953.  And shortly after that, Magna went out of business.  I believe around '64.\n\nLater, a fan of the Mark V happened to find the casting patterns for the Mark V.  He then founded ShopSmith, Inc, around 1974 and started making the it again.  \n\nI merely calling myself a SS hipster because I'm using the old, non-mainstream version ;-)",

        "body": "‚ÄúBad alcohol‚Äù is also often used to help sunscreen spread better on the skin, both so that it feels nice to apply but also helps with UV protection when the UV filters can spread more evenly on the skin. \n\nA good example, the biore watery essence is a cult favorite due to how nicely it applies on the skin, but it also has a lot of alcohol in it which makes a lot of people afraid to try it. But if you look up reviews from people who have actually used it and disliked it, almost always it‚Äôs because it made their skin greasy, not because they found it drying. Which shows the sunscreen was formulated to counter act any drying effect so the alcohol is useful without being drying. I have skin that is prone to dehydration because I live where there is harsh winters and also use tretinoin, and the watery essence is great for me because i find it hydrating and not greasy. When I travel to humid climates it‚Äôs pretty greasy though. But yea, you would expect with so much alcohol it would dry your skin out. If you have eczema or skin that is very sensitive to alcohol then it might still be good to avoid, but if you have dry skin then ‚Äúbad alcohol‚Äù isn‚Äôt automatically a recipe for disaster, it really depends on the formula.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard because people want to be able to look at an ingredients list and just know if a product is good or bad, but usually it‚Äôs YMMV.",

But if you look at the SDS for Denatured Alcohol you‚Äôll find it is less dense than water, at 0.79. \n\nSo to calculate the actual weight of denatured alcohol ‚Äî without a scale, but with a volumetric measurement like fluid ounces or mL as I see many people doing ‚Äî you actually need to multiply that number by 0.79. eg 1 mL is 0.79 grams, and 1 oz is 0.79 oz. \n\nAgain, sorry if everyone already knew this, but I figured it would be useful info, especially when comparing how alcohol stoves stack up to canister stoves. 14 fluid oz of alcohol actually only weighs 11.06 oz!",

        "body": "Finally someone made a post. Have been meaning to write one but got lazy. I bought the spray version and the roll on version. Filters are good. It's budget friendly. I have finished the roll on version and now finishing up the spray version. It's definitely oily but the plus is there is no white cast. However, I don't use it on my face as I do not like the oily/sticky feeling. I use it on my arms and feet. And it does a good job of protecting them. I really don't think it's water resistant though - I do reapply whenever I have washed my hands. \n\nI have to be  generous with the spray. Use around 10-12 pumps on each arm and about 2-3 pumps on the top of my feet. The texture is runny for the spray and ever so slightly thicker for the roll on ( I don't think there is a lot of difference in the composition between the two- but I haven't really checked). The best thing? It's  manufactured in France and it is moisturising. I haven't got any breakouts because of it . It is really bougie on a budget like OP said. WRP!\n\nEdit- I do use the solar protective gloves over my hands even with sunscreen application as I have a tendency to develop rashes on exposed areas. But on the rare occasion that I have been lazy to use them, these provided good protection.",

I will never use spray sunscreen for my first application but I feel for reapplications it is a valid option if you avoid wind and do it properly.

Is there or will there be any kind of camp stove exemption? Will everyone just switch to canister stoves? (No cook not an option for me because: hot coffee).\n\nI'm surprised I haven't seen more news about it. Apparently the ban took effect at the beginning of 2019, but retailers were allowed to sell existing stock, they just couldn't order more. Didn't have any problems last year, but in the last couple months I've tried to buy from a couple of different stores that were permanently sold out so it is becoming real. Seems like it's on track to impact PCT / JMT / Sierra resupplies this year.\n\nThat said I haven't been able to find any official documentation online. As best I can tell the California Air Resources Board is tasked with reducing VOCs emitted into the atmosphere and they decided that denatured alcohol is a significant source that needed to be controlled. I don't know anything about the science of whether or not denatured alcohol is a significant pollutant so I'm not prepared to criticize their decision, but I do wish there was an explanation. Things are certainly less than ideal when half-hinged letters to the editor are the best source of information about what is going on-\n\n[https://www.timesheraldonline.com/2019/12/20/anthony-mills-ban-is-nonsense/](https://www.timesheraldonline.com/2019/12/20/anthony-mills-ban-is-nonsense/)",

However it gives worse gas mileage (lower energy per gallon so fewer miles per gallon); for awhile in the early-to-mid 1990s I was going mildly crazy wondering why my car's gas mileage was gradually worsening, until I read that gas stations in LA were required to sell gasohol instead of just gasoline.",

The theory was that the alcohol had such a low flash point that the fumes could've ignited and scared the crew because they heard an explosion below deck and could've seen smoke. This caused them to abandon ship hastily, and not properly tether the ship to the evacuation boat(s) as a result.",

Over the past 11 months, I've been cooking my own food with a burner that runs on denatured alcohol. I prefer to cook my own food due to dietary restrictions. However, I cannot find denatured alcohol in most hardware stores here in Cambodia. I'm sure denatured alcohol exists, but I don't know how to translate it into the local language. My last option would be collating a number of photos of denatured alcohol and putting that in my kindle to show to the store's salespeople... But if there's an easier way to acquire denatured alcohol, please share your tricks with me. I appreciate your response!",

Everyone who has basic chemistry knowledge will know them and most people running stores do know.\n\nIn order: 1 carbon, 2 carbons, 3 carbons and 4 carbon\n\n* Gases: Methane, ethane, propane and (n-)butane\n\n* Liquids: Methanol, ethanol, propanol and (n-)butanol\n\n**Liquids for backpacking:**\n\n* Methanol is very poisonous and used as a solvent and as an antifreeze in pipelines and windshield washer fluid. It is used to make ethanol undrinkable, ie. denature.\n\n* Ethanol is far less poisonous, it's what is commonly referred as alcohol and is consumed through mouth world wide. 3-8% in beer, 9-16% in wine, vodka most commonly 38-40%, 30-50% in spirits and some speciality drinks go up to 80%. Pure ethanol bottles are usually 96% because moisture from air dissolves into the bottle after you open the cap. It's cheap as dam to make, but because it's drinkable and intoxicating, it's often regulated and denatured with something that will make you throw up immediately. Usually drinkable ethanol is taxed to be expensive and the same stuff with some additives, denatured, is cheap, around 1$/litre.\n\n**Gases for backpacking:**\n\n* Boiling (vaporization) point\n\nn-butane    -0.5C    31F\n\nisobutane    -12C    11F\n\npropane      -42C   -44F\n\n* So propane is superior in cold weather, but it has too high pressure for thin-walled cartridges. On the other hand, butane gas stoves are great for backpacking, when you want light weight cartridge. These are the typical pocket rocket gases.",

Methanol/ethanol mixes are commonly used in professional resin printing as the washing agent, so I don't see how sirrealofpentacles is correct. Pure ethanol, isopropyl, methanol, butanol, all have approximately the same performance when cleaning resin. Which you use tends to come down to price and other factors (flammability, smell, etc). Isopropyl alcohol tends to be recommended because it's less toxic and tends to smell better, not because it cleans prints better.

Form Labs recommends IPA or tripropylene glycol monomethyl ether. I have never seen methanol recommended for cleaning parts, which is unsurprising considering its toxicity. And any medicine-related application is more likely to use ethanol, both due to its far lower toxicity to humans and because methanol is not an effective sterilizing agent.

Everyone in a position that requires handling hazardous materials should be familiar with the MSDS, only use the chemicals in the proper environment, and do the research to make sure you are using the appropriate safety equipment. However, it is also important to take into account specifics when discussing such matters. When initially doing research on this topic, the guide I used was the Methanol Institute's safe handling guide.\n\n[Methanol Safe Handling Guide](https://www.methanol.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SafeHandlingManual-Health-Safety-Module.pdf)\n\nIt is true for example that methanol can be absorbed through the skin. So how dangerous is it? According to the guide, submerging your entire hand in a vat of methanol for two minutes represents less than 200mg of exposure. And in low splash risk environments (i.e. you are not going to dump a barrel of it over you) nitrile gloves are considered sufficient protection. Air protection only requires that an area be well ventilated as with most toxic chemicals and requires no protection. There is very little data on actual cases of contact or inhalation poisoning because it virtually never happens. Given the specifics of alcohol use in resin printing, I don't consider these serious concerns. Or put another way, yes methanol is more toxic than the alternatives in a vacuum, but given how we use it, the risks are still negligible with the standard safety precautions. So, is methanol safe enough to use as a hobbyist? People can read about it and decide that for themselves, but in my opinion it certainly is.  \n\nThe one risk I *do* think is extremely serious is if you have young children. If you have children under the age of 10, by no means should you *ever* use denatured alcohol for this, and I would seriously consider making sure you don't have any anywhere in the house. It is simply not worth the risk, and a child who drinks any amount of it will almost certainly die.",

You shouldn't leave your prints in a tub of alcohol to clean them no matter what you use. *All* alcohol based cleaning agents will eventually break down resin, including IPA. Given the small timescales involved however (around 5 minutes), there is no meaningful difference between them.\n\nIsopropyl alcohol is usually recommended for its comparatively low toxicity and weak smell, not its ability to break down uncured resin. Also, the reason dental printers often use ethyl/methyl combos is that sterilization and washing are separate steps. The weak sterilization properties of methanol don't matter in this application because you wash in your ethanol/methanol mix, wash with water, and then sterilize with alcohol or another sterilization agent. The toxicity of the methanol doesn't matter any more than the toxicity of the uncured resin itself for the same reason. This information comes from a dental assistant friend of mine, and she claimed this was not uncommon. The reason industrial resin printing and dental printing sometimes use ethanol/methanol combinations to wash is the same as for us. It comes down to price, what you are trying to accomplish, and regulatory ease of obtaining the agent (IPA for example is more highly regulated in some parts of the world due to its extreme flammability).\n\nKeep in mind, I'm not saying denatured alcohol is *better.* You should pick the cleaning agent whose properties meet your needs. What I am saying is that when it comes to the property 'breaking down uncured resin to wash a print', there is no meaningful difference between the various alcohol options. If IPA is fifty bucks and alcohol fuel is twenty bucks, it's perfectly fine to use the alcohol fuel.",

Obviously DA is unecessary in a moisturizer for example but what about serums with active ingredients? As it is often used to increase penetration. I was browsing Vitamin C serums & a lot of them have DA.\n\n Would you skip on a good Vitamin c serum just because it has Denatured alcohol?\nShould one limit DA in only product in their routine instead of having 2 or more that contain it for example? Do you choose to not have any of it in your skincare even tho youre not sensitive to it? If so why? Whats your take on it?\nWould love to hear peoples opinion on this or the science side of things.",

It's really nice and I like to use it on my body. Be aware that there are two versions, one with and without perfume. the perfumed one has a quite heavy and lasting scent, so I wouldn't want to use it on my face (but I am surprised that I enjoy it on my body. It's more a body lotion scent, not very typical for a sunscreen). It has some comedogenic ingredients so I havn't tried it on my face yet (and also because I only have the perfumed version.)\n\nof the P20's I tried the sensitive skin. It's quite shiny / emollient. It's a good heavy duty sunscreen for outside/sports days. Not my favorite on my face but it works.\n\nEucerin Oil control feels very dry on my oily-dehydrated skin. I do not like it.\n\nMy fav alcohol-free sunscreen is currently the Bioderma Photoderm Aquafluide [https://www.bioderma.de/unsere-produkte/photoderm/aquafluide-lsf-50](https://www.bioderma.de/unsere-produkte/photoderm/aquafluide-lsf-50) .

None of these ever caused irritation on me nor on my daughter. We've used a couple of tubes of Intense Protect when she was a toddler. It's heavy and sticky, but non-irritating and protects well. When she was a baby I used the non-tinted non-perfumed wallpasty mineral screen (in the small white tube) on her and have nothing bad to say about it. Of the face versions I've used an untinted fragrance free combo-skin fluid that I think is discontinued and replaced with the Invisible Touch.

The excess dye can be removed with a rag and alcohol. You really can't build up a darker shade by adding more dye if you are applying the dye directly to the wood. Again referring to the photo, the areas where there is not a leathery look are as dark as you can go. Darker shading can be had by using the dye to color lacquer for spray application. If you want to hand apply the dye directly to the wood though, you'll want to be wary of the limits of how much dye the wood can absorb. Also be aware that the end grain will absorb more dye and appear darker. You can prevent this from happening (to some extent) by lightly dampening areas of end grain with a damp (with water) rag before applying the dye.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nR.M.

They specifically warn against using water/alcohol-based dyes applied directly to their veneer woods, which is not a problem for ANY other brand of kit, and your experience suggests that they apply the same, stain-resistant sealer to other woods too.  StewMac products need to be approached with a plan for extra sanding, or simply given an opaque finish, and that first option can lead to minor disasters with their thin, sealed veneers.  Given that I only use translucent stains/dyes, myself, I'll never buy a kit from them, just the occasional tool.",

I picked up a new one last night, used a bit, and then checked the ingredients on the box. I was sad to see that denatured alcohol is the third ingredient  It also contains lemon extract, which I am not too concerned about, but I also wish it weren't in there.\n\nSee the full ingredient list here: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Alcohol Denat., Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Squalane, Bis-Peg/Ppf-14/14 Dimethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Talc, Nylon-12, Maltitol, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Sorbitol, Caffeine, Citrus Medica Limonum Extract/Lemon Fruit Extract. [+/- May Contain: CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499/Iron Oxides].\n\nThe skin around my eyes does look dry sometimes, so I think that after this discovery, I shouldn't use it anymore, right?  I am looking for a new concealer but it's so hard to find a good one.  I saw that the NARS radiant concealer is popular in the other posts so I also went to Sephora last night but none of the shades in that brand match me very well.  I have light skin with yellow undertones (I am between Vanilla and Custard in that NARS concealer.  I wear the shade Frisky Abyssinian in Meow Cosmetics foundations).  I ended up taking home samples of a Marc Jacobs concealer and a Make Up For Ever one.  It's so frustrating to find a something which matches my skintone, doesn't look cakey, and and doesn't dry out my skin.  Any suggestions?",

    "body": "Hello everybody!  \n  \nI've recently gotten into hobby chemistry at home and for a minor project I'm working on need alcohol for an extraction I'm planning on doing (plus, solvents like alcohols are just handy to have on hand). Usually a chemist would buy denatured ethanol from a chemical supplier, however they usually don't ship to individuals (for good reason) and the ones that do supply much higher concentrations and purities than what a hobby chemist could need, in turn making it much more expensive than what I can afford.  \n\nBrewing my own alcohol at home is an option I'm considering, and that's where I turn to this community, to seek help and answers. I should note that the alcohol I'm trying to brew is *not intended for consumption*. This means I do not care about the presence of methanol (or any other alcohol) in the final product. I have a background in chemistry so I'm familiar with the general concepts of brewing alcohol. I do, however, have a couple of questions that I hoped a more experienced homebrewer than myself could answer.  \n  \n1) What yeast should I use? Please keep in mind, I'm a chemist. Not a brewer. I'm not looking for a yeast that makes beer glow in the dark or that makes mead taste like cotton candy, I'm just looking for a type of yeast that produces the highest concentration of ethanol in, preferably, the shortest amount of time. I understand this question might not be as simple as I'm making it out to be, but what it boils (or, distills) down to, is that I need a type of yeast that produces alcohol (any alcohol will do) with not a whole lot of other stuff going on.  \n  \n2) If I have a yeast to brew with, what do I feed it? Yeast lives off sugars, so foods high in sugar come to mind, like fruit. However, fruit can be expensive. Plus, if my limited education on brewing has taught me anything, it's that the food for the yeast determines the product. Since the alcohol Im looking to produce isn't ment for consumption, I dont care whether there's a bit of methanol in my product, hell, it might even be all methanol for all I care. What I'm asking is *what is the cheapest, most readily available food for yeast to produce any type of alcohol*? I'm also not worried about bacterial growth, since I'll be distilling my product regardless. Does that mean I could use fruit scraps?\n  \n3) What's the highest concentration of alcohol (before distillin I can realistically achieve when brewing at home?  \n  \n4) or I guess, 0)? Is this even worth my money? Say, if I wanted to brew enough product to get me half a liter of alcohol after distillation. Would that cost me more in terms of yeast and food than if I were to buy that volume of concentrated denatured alcohol to begin with? Please understand that answering 'yes' is absolutely no dealbreaker for me, Im only asking this question to potentiaal curb my expectations. After all, I'm also here to explore the science behind brewing, more so than to pursue a financial gain from this endeavour.  \n  \nI hope some of you may be able to help me answer these questions, thank you in advance to those who take the time to do so!",

        "body": "You can buy denatured alcohol by the quart at hardware stores. It has 5% methanol added to it. They use it to thin shellac and as a cooking stove fuel. That would be the easiest and cheapest way to go. You can't distill higher than 95% because ethanol is hygroscopic. You can hit around 95% with multiple distillations and hit about 99.9% by running the distillate over a molecular sieve drier like silica gel. It won't stay at 99.9% for long as it will absorb water from the air until it drops back down to 95%. You would want to use a yeast like turbo yeast which I believe can get up to 18%. For sugar you can just use common table sugar as you don't care what the end product tastes like. So yeah, what your trying is way to much work when you can just run to the hardware store. If by the off chance that you're underage and trying to make moonshine keep in mind that you can't distill the methanol out of denatured alcohol as it forms an azeotrope that can't be separated by distillation, that's why they add the methanol to it. Distilling high purity alcohols is inherently dangerous due to flammability, so unless you are set up to safely do this, then don't. It will be much cheaper to buy the alcohol at the hardware store, but the time you buy the yeast, and fuel for multiple distillations it will cost a lot more than buying it. Hope this helps.",

Stir to dissolve.  Let cool to about 70 degrees then add AlcoMax turbo yeast.  Ferment in a covered bucket that has a hole in the lid to allow CO2 to escape.  Keep the hole covered with a rag.

My biggest skincare concern I absolutely have to address daily and I mean daily is clogged pores. My pores clog into hairlike protrusions I believe are called sebaceous filaments...don't google image search this term if you have a weak stomach. After years of searching for a solution, and I mean almost my entire life, I found one: BHA. And I'm not talking about all the acne cleansers with salycilic acid, as they are, as far I've researched, almost all out of the pH window that ensures effectiveness. I've tried the paulas choice best selling BHA liquid. I've also tried The Ordinary 2% Salycilic. Both do the trick. But both have to be ordered online. The good ones at sephora/high end stores are ridiculously priced. I've yet to find a good BHA at the drugstore. So... The Ordinary BHA I've most recently been using quickly ran out as it comes in a ridiculously small size...only 15 mL! Without BHA my pores became ridiculously clogged after a day or two. I found myself in Walgreens desperate for an affordable Leave on BHA product, i didn't care about any of the ingredients I threw all my cosmetic formulary knowledge out the window. I just needed something that would get rid of my sebaceous filaments! \"This will just be for the short term\" I told myself. And so I found one product that was in the correct pH range (According to beautypedia's 1 star review on the product). It's neutrogena's triple action acne toner 2% Salicylic acne treatment. The second ingredient is alcohol denat. And just a few later, fragrance. I purchased it anyways because I needed to not have these hideous clogged pores on my nose. This product is absolutely drying as hell, but when I'm applying my serums and moisturizers after it, my skin has literally never felt or looked better. I know high levels of denatured alcohol on skin is pro-oxidant and drying and so on. But my skin looks and feels so good. I find myself trying to find a scientific source that says alcohol is okay on the skin. Has Paula Begoun brainwashed me? Do I need to rethink everything I know about skincare? I hate that I look forward to using this product I know is probably aging me and damaging my skin. BUT I don't want to stop using this affordable Walgreens BHA exfoliant!\n\nHELP!",

But at the top half, I feel like the concentration is just too much when some other ingredient known to be beneficial and non-irritating could be in its place",

I don‚Äôt mind ordering it but Im Canadian and shipping can be super expensive, my client has a a couple baby BP they want done but i don‚Äôt want to give them something that will rot over time so they are in the freezer for now.

If you use formaldehyde for fixation, it can be useful, to put it in demineralised water before transferring it to some liquid storage medium, in some cases you can get a very fine dust of paraformaldehyde, which starts to fall out.   \nThe 70 % ethanol is sort of a gold standard for wet specimens, because it does not harden the specimen so much like 90 % ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. Also a study has shown, that a container that leaks (almost all containers do leak a bit after some time) will not be so much of a problem with 70 % ethanol as with 50 % or 90 % ethanol, because the 70 % ethanol seems to be the most \"stable\" concentration, it will not evaporate so quickly and if it does, the concentration does not change much.",

For metal miniatures you can also use Acetone.\n\nIf you choose to use a product like Dettol or Simple Green, you will usually need to soak the minis for up to 24 hours in order to successfully remove the paint. After the models have soaked, use an old toothbrush to scrub the paint off the minis.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think people just assumed methanol is often put in hand sanitizer cuz it's so bizzare to hear someone drank it when you're not familiar with the reality that some people drink hand sanitizer occasionally, usually those who are in poverty &/or homeless. when reading that those individuals overdosed & either died or went blind from the methanol in the hand sanitizer, they just assumed it's a legal ingredient when it's not. methanol is often found within ethanol, especially higher proofs in trace amounts that aren't harmful. But it shouldn't ever be in hand sanitizer or anything we drink or put on our skin to dangerous levels. I wonder if they sell methanol test strips to test your ethanol alcohol, like needle exchanges pass out fentanyl test strips for free to test other drugs for the presence of. If not, it should be made available. gonna search Amazon when I start home brewing lmao.",

Tried it with fantastic results - and guess what the active ingredient is? Tripropylene glycol *methyl* ether. We have a winner!\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/1vc4ti/marker_goo_gone_no_more_marker/",

Yes, it will not like water that is spilled on it, but if you are quick about cleaning it up then things will usually be okay. If you get a ring or if it blushes then you can refresh the finish fairly easily. Shellac is easy to apply and easy to repair. Coasters and paste wax can prevent most issues that would occur. \n\nI recommend using dewaxed shellac instead of regular shellac. Once the wax is removed from the shellac it gets tougher and it does a better job a resisting water, alcohol, etc.  \n\nYou can dewax shellac by letting regular shellac sit, undisturbed, for a while. The wax will sink to the bottom and you can decant the liquid off of the top. You can also purchased dewaxed flakes. \n\nIf you want, you can add a coat of varnish just to the top of the table. Apply shellac to everything else. If there are children, frequent party guests, or well intentioned in-laws that use the wrong cleaners then a varnish top coat will reduce frequent repairs.

I was told a deglazer would work but I'd have to redye some.\n\nI'm not a patient person and I didn't want to wait for some deglazer to come in so I took what I had access to and gave it a try on a piece from my bag that I realized wouldn't work (too short so had to cut a longer piece last night).  \nIt was done in the same order as the rest so I figured it would do.\n\n1) On the far left (removed some dye), you can see the results of using a little denatured alcohol on the magic eraser and LIGHTLY rubbing to erase. I erased too much on a high spot...  \n2) Next to that (slightly less glossy than the untouched part) is where I used just the dry magic eraser to rub at the resolene. I don't think this did enough but we will see soon.  \n3) Next in line with the high gloss is the untouched part as my control. It still has the resolene layer intact.  \n4) To the far right is the one I think did the best (though evenness is questionable). I used the magic eraser dry and then lightly wiped the alcohol soaked side across (not rubbed, but just wiped hence the streaks). I think this gives the most control and still removes enough I can oil the leather.\n\nThe next step is to try adding more neatsfoot oil to each section so I can determine if it takes the oil again. Hopefully one of these ways will do the trick and I can get back on track with making my bag.  \nI'll report back so that if it works, maybe others can benefit too.\n\nEdit: [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/OfoxsPr) is the Imgur link with the updated picture.",

When my skin was very oily using a toner with alcohol was refreshing and helpful.  It never made me more oily.  Now that my oily skin is under control with medication I still occasionally use a high alcohol toner, but they can be drying and irritating.  My toner has glycerin which seems to limit the drying effect.  It is a YMMV thing to be sure, but like I said, alcohol can also be beneficial oily skin by dissolving and removing excess sebum, allowing products to penetrate better and allowing a more matte finish when a product dries.",

It specifically says \"not rubbing alcohol.\" \n\nIs this correct or possibly outdated information?  Most advice I've read for cleaning electronics suggest using Isoropyl (rubbing) alcohol as it's pure isopropanol and will evaporate quickly and completely.  Denatured alchohol is ethanol with any of a number of additives to make it undrinkable, sometimes including methynol, which leaves an oily residue behind.\n\nSo, my question is: is the recommendation for denatured alcohol with the intention to leave some of that residue behind?  Or is it just that Isopropyl wasn't widely available in the late 70s and it'ss actually a better cleaner for these?  Any thoughts welcome :)",

I moisturise before . Is it because my moisture barrier is fragile and denatured alcohol making it worse or else?",

My go-to is the Australian Gold tinted sunscreen, though I don't know if it's available there. Others I've heard good things about but you'll have to check for in your country: kinship, cosrx aloe soothing sun cream, sum bum mineral tinted sunscreen, bliss block Star and one by the brand cotz. I believe LRP also has mineral spfs, though idk how well they work on the face cosmetically.",
