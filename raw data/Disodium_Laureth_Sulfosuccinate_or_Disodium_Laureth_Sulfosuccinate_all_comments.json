I’m not affiliated with any brand but I can see how some may feel negatively towards this, especially considering some of the history on the sub for brands to exploit the readers here. \n\nI may make a separate post later with recommendations as well as a bit of a discussion around it for people who are looking for recommendations. \n\n—-\n\nHi guys!\n\nYears ago I wrote[ the sidebar'd piece about dehydrated skin that I still get tagged in today](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/22c4tf/dehydrated_skin_and_the_moisture_barrier_an/). I wanted to update that with some more detailed information and knowledge on why it happens, what is happening, et cetra. Hopefully this can replace that guide, since I feel like it was a bit too broad. :)\n\n---\n\nDehydration is characterized by a lack of hydration in the cellular system and intercellular channels of the skin. It is not a skin type, but a skin condition. It does not discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin types, and is frequently aggravated by lifestyle and skincare choices. \n\nTo understand skin dehydration, you need to first understand the role of the natural moisturizing factors (NMF) in skin hydration. The NMF is an invisible lipid composition that sits on the top layer of the stratum corneum (SC) as well as interwoven in the top most layers of corneocytes (skin cells), making up a part in what is considered the \"acid mantle\" of the skin. The term NMF first appeared in 1959, but was not universally adopted immediately. It is hydrosoluable (able to dissolve in water) and hygroscopic (able to retain water), composed of about 40% free amino acids, 12% pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA), 12% lactates, 8.5% sugars/peptides/inorganic acids, 7% urea, 6% chloride, 5% sodium, and various small amounts of other materials. \n\nIt serves three major functions:\n\n1.  Protecting skin from damage\n2.  Encouraging desquamation (exfoliation of the upper most layer of corneocytes)\n3.  Controlling permeability of the SC\n\nThe NMFs are very effective natural humectants, drawing moisture to the skin from the atmosphere, even at humidity as low as 50%. \"Hydrated NMF forms ionic interacts with keratin fibers, reducing the intermolecular forces between the fibers and thus increasing the elasticity of the stratum corneum.\"² This keeps the skin healthy and supple in appearance. It also serves to prevent excessive water influx (see the third major function above), such as when your skin wrinkles from being in the bath or shower for too long, which causes the corneocytes to shrink. \n\nWhile it is often thought that the stratum corneum is \"dead\" tissue, it still requires water to function effectively. The NMF serves to provide for this, drawing and holding much of the water required. For example, enzymes that cause skin cells to exfoliate away naturally, by breaking the various bonds holding corneocytes together, need water to do their job effectively. \n\nReduction or stripping away of the NMF results in dry skin ([known as xerosis](https://imgur.com/vBOb07w)), scaling, flaking, as well as fissuring and cracking ([such as severely cracked and dry heels](https://imgur.com/C0F7BKK)). It can also result in what we refer to as \"dehydrated skin\" (though this is not a medical term).\n\n* * *\n\nWhat Dehydration Feels Like\n===========================\n\nDehydrated skin is one of the more difficult conditions to diagnose because it is frequently invisible. There are many \"tips\" online about how to diagnose dehydrated skin, such as pinching the back of your hand to see how quickly the skin snaps back into place. *It's important to keep in mind that this only serves to show if your body is dehydrated. Dehydrated skin usually has less to do about the hydration inside of your body and more to do with how we treat the skin topically or the atmosphere around us.* This is why someone with dehydrated skin can pinch the back of their hand and see their skin immediately pop back into place, yet feel horrible irritation on their skin when applying a simple moisturizer.  \n\n[The skin usually looks dry, scaly, or flaky](https://imgur.com/cLTwbTf), and feels \"tight\" (such as after using a harsh cleanser). When pulled very gently, [it can appear to crinkle](https://imgur.com/8RRFIfj) (not to be confused with crepey skin, such as the skin appearance around joints), and can even look like it has a very thin layer of skin sitting atop the upper most layer of skin. In some people, it feels itchy. It is usually most evident on the forehead or nose. It can also look lackluster, dull, and lack \"bounce\" and suppleness. In some, it can take the form of crinkly but very shiny skin, usually due to abuse of skin remodelers like AHAs or BHAs. \n\nBoth dry and oily skin types can be dehydrated - dry skin because it struggles to hold onto moisture and oily because sufferers frequently use harsh cleansers or astringents to gain relief. According to Milady's Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary, \"When oily skin becomes dehydrated, the surface layers of cells harden ... and block oil secretion. The result is an entrapment of the oils under the stratum corneum layer. This is particularly detrimental in the case of someone with acne because it also results in the entrapment of the infection.\"¹ \n\nDehydrated skin also typically responds more viciously to active ingredients, such as BHAs, AHAs, sulfur, retinoids, and vitamin C. It can also respond to completely benign ingredients, creating a burning sensation or the skin feeling flushed and hot.\n\n* * *\n\nCauses of Dehydration\n=====================\n\nThe most common culprits of dehydration of the skin is stripping cleansers, harsh soaps, and hot water, though a host of other causes can come into play for some people, including skin conditions that aggravate dry skin (again, while dehydrated skin is not the same as dry skin, dry skin is especially prone to dehydration) or create acne (which frequently causes people to \"overtreat\" the acne and strip their skin).\n\nSkin Conditions\n---------------\n\n*   Atopic dermatitis\n*   Irritant contact dermatitis\n*   Psoriasis\n*   Cutaneous lymphoma\n\nEnvironmental\n-------------\n\n*   Seasonal changes\n*   Dry air (low humidity)\n*   Flowing air (especially wind)\n*   UV radiation (tanning beds, the sun)\n*   Overwashing\n*   Age\n*   Sunburn\n*   Cigarette smoking and smoke exposure\n*   Friction (including harsh scrubbing and mechanical exfoliation tools like the Clarisonic)\n\nHeredity Disorders\n------------------\n\n*   Ichthyosis vulgaris\n*   Netherton syndrome\n\nHormonal\n--------\n\n*   Hypothyroidism\n*   Estrogen deficiency\n\nTopical\n-------\n\n*   Alcohol/isopropyl alcohol/SD alcohol/denatured alcohol\n*   Drinking alcohol\n*   Essential oils\n*   Clay masks\n*   Sodium lauryl sulfate\n*   Bar soap\n*   Astringents (particularly alcohol-based astringents)\n*   Topical medications (e.g. retinoids)\n*   Excessive AHA or BHA use\n\n* * *\n\nCaring for Dehydrated Skin\n==========================\n\nThe most important thing when solving dehydrated skin is consideration of the products you use as well as your environment. This means paying special attention to the ingredients label when shopping, being cautious about what is applied to the skin, and what your home environment is like (and potentially limiting outside exposure to harsh wind and sun). \n\nSince everything starts with your cleanser, this means picking a creamier cleanser or one with lower amounts of surfactants. I've done a whole post on cleansers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), if you'd like to read about all the various types of cleansers and how they work. The long and short of it is look for either a wipe-off cleansers, such as Albolene; an oil cleanser that emulsifies (rinses clean) in water, such as my beloved Clinique Take the Day off Balm; a creamy cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Aquanil; or a gentle sudsing cleanser, such as Paula's Choice Hydralight or CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. Avoid washing with hot water, which reduces the size of the micelles (the molecules created from surfactants, which cluster together), allowing them to penetrate deeper into the skin and strip it further. You'll also want to completely avoid bar soaps (pH is too high), micellar water (can be much more irritating), makeup wipes (same as micellar water), and harsh cleansers that make your skin feel tight after cleansing. \n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate. \n\nMoisturizers are also a cornerstone in treating dehydrated skin. Humectants are especially important. Some humectants to look for:\n\n*   **Glycerin** - A well-established humectant, it is a clear, thick liquid that is usually sticky on it's own. It is derived from combining water and fat, usually vegetable oil. It is not typically irritating, but it can be to some people in high concentrations.\n*   **Hyaluronic Acid (HA)** - A component of glycosaminoglycan, it occurs naturally in the dermis of the skin and is thought to play a very important role in skin function. It is advertised frequently as holding up to \"1000\" times it's weight in water (citation needed). When applied, \"hyaluronic acid forms a viscoelastic film in a manner similar to the way it holds water in the intercellular matrix of dermal connective tissue.\"¹ It needs application regularly to be effective, frequently breaking down in skin 24-48 hours after application (note: this is not the case with HA injections). It is best applied to damp skin, straight out of the shower.\n*   **Urea** - While it is frequently considered more of a moisturizer or keratolytic (able to break down bonds on dead skin) ingredient, urea has humectant properties and can attract and hold moisture in the SC.\n\n* * *\n\nHealing Dehydrated Skin\n=======================\n\nArmed with the proper ingredients, skin can typically bounce back within about two weeks (14 days). Once healed, skin should be maintained with ingredients and products that are beneficial to the skin's health. \n\nWhile healing dehydrated skin, it is recommended to use the most bland routine possible and avoid trying new things and any active ingredients at all. _It should go without saying that to heal dehydrated skin, you must drop the products that are creating the problem in the first place._ If you must change out one or two products that you believe were causing your dehydration, do so slowly and one at a time, starting with any cleansers and then moving on to moisturizers. \n\nPetrolatum is helpful to some people as well, but can cause problems for others. This is possibly due to it's ability to diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin in some people, which interferes with recovery. Your mileage may vary. \n\nIt is also recommended to sleep with a humidifier if you are in a particularly dry climate. You want to shoot for somewhere between 40-60% indoor humidity, as this will prevent the humectants from drawing moisture from the deeper layers of the skin, which evaporates away.\n\n* * *\n\nSources\n=======\n\n1.

It was a crucial part of my routine while dehydrated and I still use it to this day. I live in a very humid environment and have genetically oily skin, so I was struggling to find products for the daytime that hydrated enough but were also lightweight enough to not make my skin any more oily. Aloe was a life-saver - it was the extra hydrating layer that my skin was craving. It's not enough on it's own but when used in conjunction with a hyaluronic acid product and the proper moisturizer, it can do wonders. I just wanted to bring this up for any oily skin types (and others) that are struggling to find the right products.",

    "body": "About four years ago, I wrote the currently sidebar'd post, [\"Evaluating Your Current Routine\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1x1ubd/evaluating_your_current_routine_read_me_before/). In that, I recommended things to ask yourself and consider before buying new products or changing your routine entirely.\n\nI recently began blogging, but I wanted to bring these posts to Reddit as well for people who did not want to click out of the sub. \n\nLots of this is content that has been referenced over the years on this subreddit, as well as elsewhere. However, I understand the frustration for new users stumbling in, seeing product recommendations and terminology being thrown around, as well as an enormous sidebar. It's pretty anxiety-inducing. I also see a lot of people skipping from products to products, asking what to try next. \n\nMy goals with this series is to break down *what* goes into your cleansers and how it affects your skin so you are empowered to make better choices as well as understand some of the science that gets passed around.\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down your average, general cleansers as well as oil cleansers (or the oil-cleansing method aka OCM) and micellar cleansers. Let's dive right in!\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Cleansers**\n\nCleansers work by dissolving or binding to things on the skin that aren't normally rinsed away by water, such as the waxes or oils produced by our skin.\n\nWithout getting too into the weeds, they are able to do this with surfactants  (or \"the thing that makes cleansers sudsy\"). The most common surfactants, and the ones you may have heard of are SLS and SLES (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). These ingredients work by binding to the lipids (oils such as jojoba oil or silicones like dimethicone) and then being whisked away by their water-loving properties. Once mixed with water, surfactant molecules cluster together into little spheres known as micelles. Some surfactants molecular size allows them to penetrate deeper into the skin (namely SLS), where they can bind to skin cells. As you can imagine, this is very irritating to skin, and is what causes the eventual drying that you may experience after using some products.\n\nSo by increasing the size of these molecules or adding additional ingredients, we get a gentler cleanser.\n\nIf you've hung out in any beauty circle, you've probably also heard chatter of pH - \"What is the pH of that cleanser? Have you tried the CosRx Low pH Cleanser?\". The pH value of a cleanser can have an impact on how harsh your cleanser is on your skin as well, and simply put, it's because the surface of your skin is naturally pretty acidic.\n\nGoing back to Chemistry class really quickly, you'll probably remember something called the \"pH Scale.\"\n\nThings on the left side of the scale (1-6) are considered acidic. Things on the right side (8-14) are considered basic or alkaline. And of course, there is what is considered neutral, or pH 7. Skin has a pH of around 5.5, but becomes more basic the further down into the dermis you go, reaching a pH of about 7. Why is this important, you may be asking? Well, if you think back to your high school Chemistry course, you may have remembered the good ol' baking soda and vinegar reaction. When this reaction -- called an acid-base reaction -- occurs, the baking soda and vinegar exchange atoms and form different compounds, namely water and carbon dioxide. This is because bases are compounds that generally want to donate atoms and acids are compounds that generally want to accept atoms.\n\nAs skin comes in contact with other ingredients, even water, the pH temporarily raises and other compounds are created. Fatty acids (read: acidic components) of the skin are removed.\n\nHealthy skin can usually re-balance itself within an hour or so. Some skin takes longer to do this, especially skin that is prone to irritation, such as skin with acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. This is why your boyfriend can cleanse his face with a Dial soap bar and have glowing skin an hour later, while you're busily slathering on layer after layer of moisturizer.\n\nUsing a cleanser that is closer to our skin's natural pH is the obvious solution to this problem, and most modern cleansers are formulated much better than those of the past.\n\nSo now you're probably asking yourself: *Well, how can I test the pH of the cleanser I would like to buy? And how do I know the surfactant isn't going to irritate my skin?*\n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate.\n\nYou should also look for moisturizers, like oils, ceramides, cholesterol, and humectants (water-binding ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or squalane). Avoid saponified oils (please don't use Dr. Bronner's on your skin) and bar soap.\n\nNow I know you're asking: What about oil cleansers then?\n\n---\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\nWhat if I told you that your grandmother was ahead of the game?\n\nNearly all of us have seen a tub of Pond's Cold Cream hanging out in our grandmother's bathroom or on her vanity. You might've seen her dab some all over her skin and wipe away all of her makeup with a tissue. She may have sworn by it as the thing that kept her looking young, and she's not entirely wrong.\n\nI like to think of oil cleansers as being broken down into two types of cleansers -- wipe-off cleansers like your grandmother's Pond's, and emulsifying cleansers like the translucent oil cleansers that come in a pump or tub.\n\nThe former -- wipe-off cleansers -- are the most common mixtures in the cosmetics industry. They are usually simple mixtures of oil and water, and are high in water content, which makes them inexpensive.\n\nThey spread easily and often leave an oily or richly moisturized feeling behind. They're typically purchased by people with mature skin, but are a great alternative for people with dry skin.\n\nThe latter -- emulsifying cleansers -- are also mixtures of oil and water, but are higher in oil content, which makes them more expensive. They contain emulsifiers that bind well to water, which allows them to rinse away in water.\n\nThe benefit of these cleansers is there is no real \"sudsing\" action on the skin. Indeed many of them can actually feel \"moisturizing\" due to their ingredient makeup. They are also excellent for breaking down make-up and other waterproof things, such as mascara, due to the high oil content.\n\nWhen picking out an oil-cleanser, look for shortened ingredient lists. Don't be swayed by extracts or other frills that will wash away. The oil itself will be the biggest point of irritation (or not) for your skin, so don't be afraid of \"boring\" oils like mineral oil or petrolatum, which is one of the blandest, most non-reactive molecules around.\n\nJust one more to go...\n\n---\n\n**Micellar Cleansers**\n\nMicellar water is quite literally made up of micelles, or the molecular bunches of surfactants that group up, their water-loving butts faced outwards. These larger bunches of molecules, diluted in combinations of water and hydrating ingredients (such as glycerin), are the most mild of cleansers.\n\nThe percentage of surfactant to other ingredients is generally so low that micellar water does not need to be washed away. This allows the hydrating ingredients, such as glycerin, to stay on the skin after the debris has been removed.\n\nThis makes micellar water ideal for sensitive skin or prepping the skin for product application, when cleansing with a standard cleanser and water will be too drying.\n\n---\n\n**All Wrapped Up**\n\nSo what does this all mean? Here are some general skin cleanser guidelines to follow:\n\n* **Cleanse your skin at least once a day.** At the end of the day, your skin not only has a build-up of oils, but also debris and particulates in the air.\n* **Don't pile it on.** Your non-sudsing cleanser does not need to suds to work.\n* **Two-step cleanse for removing make-up.** Most make-up is waterproof and does not easily cleanse away. Use an oil cleanser to break down the make-up and remove it.\n* **Use cottons to remove cream cleansers like Pond's.** The friction will help to remove grime and dirt. Splash with water after to remove any leftover emulsifiers.\n* **Use cool water when cleansing.** Hot water can make surfactants penetrate deeper by reducing the size of the micelles, which is why your hot shower is more irritating and drying to your skin than the less-fun cooler shower.\n* **Moisturize.** Even water strips away the valuable fatty acids in your skin. Using a moisturizer on your skin after will help your skin to re-balance itself quicker.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Kind of Stephen](https://kindofstephen.com/)\n* [DermaScope](https://www.dermascope.com/ingredients/surfactants-and-emulsifiers)\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n",

    "body": "**UPDATE**\nI got a lot of comments saying this is seborrheic dermatitis. **What I had was NOT Seborrheic dermatitis.** SB takes a long time to heal and almost never goes away. It is difficult to treat. What I had went away in ~6 shampoos and has never come back. It was a yeast infection, just as the dermatologist diagnosed. Just wanted to clarify.\n\n---\n\nIf you have dry flaky skin, and maybe some dry flaky scalp, you might actually have the yeast infection known as dandruff! The dermatologist examined my skin (dry and flaky, prone to breakouts) and scalp (slightly flaky, but not that bad: nothing I would have sought treatment for independently). She noted the extra flakes on my forehead (where my hair touches my skin) and in my nose creases, and the fact that no amount of moisturizing has made any difference for me, and prescribed a dandruff shampoo that I would also use as a facewash. Apparently dandruff is actually a type of yeast infection!\n\n**Background:**\n\nI've been a member of this subreddit for about a year, self-identified as having \"dry\" skin with some flakes. My skin generally feels dull and listless, and I struggle with little acne breakouts all the time.\n\nI started with the Beginner's Routine, and slowly added products (patch-testing, of course) until I had this routine:\n\nMorning:\n\n* Splash with water\n* Paula's Choice BHA (~2x a week, waiting 30 mins before proceeding))\n* Moisturizer CeraVe in the tub (sometimes)\n* Elta MD 46 facial sunscreen (everyday)\n\nEvening:\n\n* OCM w/ jojoba oil (most nights)\n* CeraVe foaming cleanser (other nights)\n* If I washed with CeraVe I would use St. Ives' AHA pads, waiting 30 mins before proceeding)\n* Moisturizer CeraVe in the tub\n* Petroleum jelly\n\nNo matter what my routine was, my skin really never changed: it was always dry-feeling, dull, listless, flaky, and prone to breakouts.\n\n\n**Now**:\n\nI've only used the shampoo once (she told me to wash my face with it too), but my skin already feels soft and supple instead of dry and flaky - it feels... almost wet and sticky to me now, but in a good way. Like how the rest of my skin feels - no longer grainy, dry and flaky!\n\nWe'll see how it goes long-term, but thought I'd mention the concept of dandruff as yeast infection for others!\n\n**EDIT:**\nThe active ingredient in the shampoo is 2% ketoconazole. The prescription version of the shampoo cost $7 (it's the generic version, I don't think the price had anything to do with my not-so-great insurance). It's called \"Perrigo\". Here's the full ingredient list:\n\n* ketoconazole 2%\n* coconut fatty acid diethanolamide\n* disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n* FD & C Red No. 40\n* hydrochloric acid\n* imidurea\n* laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen\n* PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate\n* purified water\n* sodium chloride \n* sodium hydroxide\n* sodium lauryl ether sulfate",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "I vaguely remember signing up for the notification for Charlotte Cho's new launch about a month or so back and received an email about the opening of her new brand, '[Then I Met You](https://thenimetyou.com/),' this morning. While I only looked at Soko Glam during the very beginning of my skincare days, I know it's a popular outlet for a lot of people since it's a convenient, one-stop-shop for a lot of the most popular Asian beauty products. \n\nIt appears that Charlotte Cho wants to dive into the realm of making her own skincare products and the new brand touts a very similar story to a lot of other online-owned brands. Based on the 'Our Story' page, she's focusing on \"**natural, premium ingredients, even when it means cutting into our own margin.\"** (ok, sis).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe initial launch is a cleansing balm and a cleansing gel sold separately or as a pair. Here's the breakdown:\n\n* LIVING CLEANSING BALM (38.00 USD): **Massage this luxurious, sorbet-soft oil cleanser into the skin to melt away oil-based impurities, such as sunscreen, makeup and excess sebum while nourishing the skin with antioxidants, essential fatty acids and vitamin E.**\n\n>Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Trii-sostearate, PEG-8 Isostearate, Cera Microcristallina (Microcrystalline Wax/Cire Microcristalline), Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Ceresin, Synthetic Wax, Orbiignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Diospyros Kaki Fruit Extract, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Rosemarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Ethylene/Propylene Copolymer\n\n* SOOTHING TEA CLEANSING GEL (36.00 USD): **This premium gel cleanser with antioxidant and antibacterial properties uses gentle cleansing agents to clear skin of any impurities, without stripping the skin. The mandarin citrus scents are designed to awaken your senses during every use.**\n\n>Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Aqua (Water/Eau), Sorbitol, Glycerin, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Diethylhexyl, Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, 1,2 Hexanediol, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Diglycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Propylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Gluconolactone, Butylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, T-Butyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously, I haven't tried any of them yet but I probably won't be investing in these products. First, neither are fungal acne friendly unfortunately. Second, holy price point batman. They're expensive on their own and together they're 68.00 USD. Also, and this isn't a dig at Charlotte Cho, but the way some of these companies advertise their products as if they're absolutely revolutionary kind of blows my mind and is overdone. Cleansing balms and cleansing gels aren't new and there are only oh-so many ways you can reinvent the wheel. Does anyone else have any initial reactions?",

In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "So it was you, SULFATE SURFACTANTS!!\n\nI've had two patches of dyshidrotic eczema on my right palm for... I don't even know how long now, a couple months? And I've been using steroid cream on it for a while (betamethasone dipropionate in the form of Fobancort cream at first, and later Gentriderm cream which is slightly stronger) but every time it got a bit better, it would soon relapse again. It was extremely frustrating and I couldn't figure out the cause... until now.\n\nBoth my toothpaste and my shampoo contain sulfate surfactants in the form of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES). Aside from causing my dyshidrosis to constantly relapse, I'm also suspecting that SLS/SLES caused the dyshidrosis in the first place. I only have two patches of it on my right hand, but none on my left hand or anywhere else. So if it's a contact allergy, it would have to be something that only comes into contact with my right hand. I use both hands to wash my hair, but I only hold my toothbrush in my right hand, and toothpaste gets on it pretty easily. Thus, my right hand is in contact with more SLS/SLES than my left.\n\nI happened to get two sample packets of shampoo while buying stuff from The Face Shop (it's a K-beauty store, but I'm not a fan of most of their products for face - too many fragrances) recently, and noticed that it was free of sulfate surfactants. Instead, it used disodium laureth sulfosuccinate (DLSS), which tl;dr [isn't a sulfate and is very gentle on the skin](\nhttps://slsfree.net/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate/).\n\nI had also started noticing some itching on my right palm after washing my hair, so I decided to try the sulfate-free shampoo for a couple nights to see if it made things better.\n\nIt did. The redness and inflammation has gone down a lot in just two nights without relapsing, when previously it would keep coming back even though I was using steroid cream and Permasol (potassium permanganate solution, prescribed by the doctor to be diluted 1:8 with water and used as a wash, for drying out the blisters) daily.\n\nI also did a bit more experimenting by using another shampoo we have at home, which has ammonium lauryl sulfate and ammonium laureth sulfate instead of SLS and SLES, but my dyshidrotic eczema started itching immediately. (ALS/ALES are supposed to be less irritating than SLS/SLES, but evidently they're still too irritating for me.) \n\nI went out and bought the full sized sulfate-free shampoo, which is the Dr Schwarz Shampoo for Damaged Hair. It's normally priced at $21 (Singapore dollars) here, with the hair treatment conditioner being the same price, but due to a promotion I got both for $30, which is nice. I'm hoping that my dyshidrosis will finally recover without relapsing now that I've gotten rid of sulfates. I'll also be holding my toothbrush in my left hand for the time being... may look for sulfate-free toothpaste in the future as well.\n\nSo yeah, if you've also been playing whodunnit with your skincare / shower ingredients to find the potential cause of a contact allergy... it might be sulfates.",

As most of you, I've tried everything, and been to every doctor around here.\n\nSteroid cream never worked, nor any other natural cream. Doctors started to believe that it was caused by stress, but i never believe it, since I had my worst break outs on Vacation periods. I've also changed my diet, but i never noticed any real change.\n\nWhen  I Read this post, it really made a lot of sense. Every patch I have is on the outter part of my palms. It has never really affected my little fingers nor the inner part, i even still have finger prints in both fingers. So I thought that May be the sulfates were really causing my Eczema.\n\nFrom Day 1, i stopped using my common shampoo, my hand and face soap. I have not found any sulfate free tooth paste, but the rest has been enough to see a radical progress.\nThree weeks ago I had so many blisters that i could not bend my fingers. Now, i see no blisters at all. \n\nMy hands still very dry, im using Eucerin cream to hydrate. Im not 100% sure this is it, but never been this optimistic before.

An inch or two shorter than classic length (Aka mid butt length hair), High Porosity\n* **Hair concerns:** Split ends, normal amount of hairfall, prone to frizz, can look dry and damaged if I don't take care of it.\n* **Scalp type:** Normal, I think. Gets oily 2nd day night or 3rd day morning after hairwash\n* **Scalp concerns:** I don't use any product on my scalp but I feel like it's prone to build up and if I don't use an anti-dandruff shampoo every few washes, I get CCs on my forehead. Whatever causes my CCs are particularly invisible but my then derm insisted it was dandruff and following her regimen did get rid of the CCs without any skincare topical or prescription.\n* **Age/age range** \\- 25 to 35\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Current Haircare routine:**\n\n1. Pre Shampoo - Some homemade oil concoction (I add a lot of tiny oil bottles, I needed to empty, so I just mixed them all together.) or Plum Avocado Hair Mask\n2. Anti dandruff - Scalpe pro (I got L'oreal pure clay a while ago, to see if that will work instead of this, but haven't fully tested it out yet)\n3. Scalp shampoo - Alpecin Double Effect\n4. Length of the hair - Dove hydrating shampoo for curly hair (early days, haven't formed any impression yet.)\n5. Protein conditioner - Plum Olive and Macadamia Hair Mask (as and when necessary)\n6. Conditioner - Garnier Hair Food Papaya variant or Banana variant ( I like Papaya way better than banana, but neither of them are worth full price and Im still mourning the discontinuation of Matrix biolage purple cap)\n\nI've reviewed quite a few of the products I use, including Alpecin [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vqot48/my_current_haircare_routine_reviews_reequil/), but Alpecin deserves its own review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Climatic conditions under which the product was tested:** All. Summer, What passes for winter in the south, Monsoon.\n* **Usage timeline:** 1.5 years atleast. Almost done with my second bottle. And I've purchased it in Mid-September, this bottle has lasted me 8 months.\n* **Ingredient List:** [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n* **Price:** MRP 699 for 200 ml. Never seen this on discount. :(\n* **Texture, Consistency details:** Normal shampoo consistency, A blueish grey colour, so definitely added colour. You can see a hit of the colour and consistency [here](https://imgur.com/CVTsVhO.jpg)\n* **Fragrance:** HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n* **Usage:** I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply **on scalp only (Never below nape)**. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp. If I've oiled twice, I shampoo twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Effect on hair issues and result of using the product:** Shiny frizz free hair, but definite loss of volume. If I had to use 1 word to describe it \"sleek\".\n* **Experience and thoughts in detail:**\n\n***Old Review, copied from my previous post and slightly edited***\n\nThis shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation.\n\nAlpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (obvious conflict of interests. I remember reading the study but can only find the [abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17396054/) now) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit this for it. Maybe it'll work for others but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Updated Review***\n\nBarely anything to update if I'm honest. I stand by everything I said above, and they still hold true.\n\nAbout hairfall, I definitely don't think it helps. SO still thinks it helps, but acknowledges that he likes the user experience of it so much that he may be biased. Don't trust him.\n\nIn 2018, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled that caffeine shampoo Alpecin must no longer advertise that it can \"help to reduce hair loss\" as there was no adequate evidence to support the claim.  ***I definitely don't recommend buying this hoping it'll cure your hairfall issues.***\n\nThe main reason, I wanted to re-review this, is to post [this video](https://imgur.com/pt98TCe)\n\nI took these too [Pic 1](https://imgur.com/Sb7u13B.jpg), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/fZMkSHb.jpg), but even though they are from back cam, quality is super bad. The video is a decent representation of what it looks like.  I'll update this post with better pics when I'm able to take them.\n\n**Other things to add**\n\n* The whole time I used Alpecin, I also used Scalpe pro. ie I used scalpe pro every few washes most of the year, but peak summer and winter or if I see signs of CCs, I used it every single wash and followed it up with Alpecin.  So every wash I used Alpecin but every few washes I used Scalpe pro + Alpecin.\n* u/santa96 has commented below that it didn't work for them, so I was running over possibilities. And one theory is the AD shampoo was actually stripping than I thought (I have used it alone, only for experimenting / testing purposes.  I originally thought it wasn't as stripping as most other AD shampoos but still drying compared to regular shampoos. Which is why I followed it up with Alpecin. But it could be that continued usage, caused dryness and the protein in the Alpecin was immediate damage control and THAT's why I love it so much.\n* This is just a hypothesis and is of now, untested. But my scalpe pro is almost over and I should know in a couple of months if I right.\n* Anyone for now, I obviously need to test it out under more conditions. This review is moot. I mean I still love it, but it needs to have more information for anyone else to judge if it'll work for you and I currently don't have that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ETA on 10/02/24: \n\nI had previously tagged this as OP-ED because I wanted to test out the following.\n\na) If I use Alpecin with no stripping products will it cause protein overload\n\nAnswer: No. It doesn't. 9 months later I still use Alpecin every single wash.\n\n* I've used it with the following variables affecting it\n   * Oiled hair\n   * Oiled hair + Clarifying shampoo (Loreal Pure Clay)\n   * Oiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n   * Unoiled hair\n   * Unoiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n\nand no protein overload. In fact except for a couple of months in the middle where I damaged my hair in beach vacations, my hair is way way way more healthier now than it was before.\n\nb) If I use it with a garden variety clarifying shampoo instead of a stripping anti-dandruff shampoo, will I still rave about it.\n\nAnswer: Yes. I would and I am. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Anything that you think others might find a con:** Price probably\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Holy Grail, Forever repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;",

The only other one I've tried (a very cheap one) was basically a gel that didn't foam and was basically impossible to properly clean the hair with.

I've also noticed it has quite a bit of surfactants in its ingredient list:\n\n- Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate (amphoteric)\n\n- Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate (aionic)\n\n- Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate (aionic) \n\n- Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate (aionic)\n\nI just can't help but wonder if including 4 mild surfectants is just as bad as using SLS? How many should a regular SLS-free have? And that it foaming so much is a bad sign. I only use it around 2-3 times a week but I colour my hair and I like the colour to last as long as possible so if this is as stripping as SLS I'd rather find something new.\n\nSorry if this is a n00b question - I *am* a n00b but it's hard to find answers to questions about specific products.\n\nedit: added whether the surfactants were aionic or not.",

    "body": "I've used this product for like a year now and just recently looked at the ingredients to try and dupe it. I feel like there's no reason this should cost $25 for 8oz. I love using this as a pre-poo because I love the minty-tingly feeling. It's a very conditioning product imo but the surfactants help rinse it out easy. In my dupe I wanted to make this a little more conditioning with BTMS-50 instead of their weird cetearyl alcohol and SLS emulsifier. Instead of SLS, I opted for SCI and CMPB to make this product lather and rinse out easier. I also added some centramonium chloride which the original product used to contain (it no longer does) to add to the conditioning feeling. The bulk of my version is cetyl alcohol because the OG product is very slippy and when I rinse it out it can easily detangle the length of my hair. \n\nThe original ingredients: Fresh Mint Infusion (Mentha Piperita) (Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract) , Water (Aqua) , Cetearyl Alcohol and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate , Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate , Citric Acid , Propylene Glycol , Honey , Peppermint Oil (Mentha piperita) , Sweet Orange Oil (Citrus sinensis) , Spearmint Oil (Mentha spicata) , Grapefruit Oil (Citrus paradisi) , Nettle Absolute (Urtica urens) , Neroli Oil (Citrus Aurantium amara) , Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Olea europaea) , *Limonene , *Linalool , *Citral , Fragrance , Methylparaben , Propylparaben .\n\nMy version: \n\nSURFACTANT PHASE | PHASE A \n\nSCI 10%\n\nCMPB 7% \n\nCentramonium chloride 4%\n\nWATER PHASE| PHSSE B \n\n Distilled Water 57.5%\n\nHoneyquat 3%\n\nOIL PHASE| PHASE C\n\nCetyl alcohol 6%\n\nBTMS 50 4%\n\nOlive Oil 4%\n\nMenthol crystals 2%\n\nCOOLDOWN PHASE | PHASE D \n\nPeppermint EO 1%\n\nSpearmint EO 1%\n\nLiquid Germall Plus 0.5%\n\nHeated phase A, B, and C in a water bath until everything was heated thoroughly then added the water phase to the oil phase, blended for about 30 seconds and added in my surfactant phase. It'll be quite runny until it cools. Add your Cooldown phase and it's pretty much ready to use. \n\nI apply this to my scalp 15 minutes before washing. When I get into the shower to rinse it, my scalp feels very moisturized. It still lathers a tiny bit upon rinsing it out, but I feel like my version is a bit more slippy than the original which I love. I would appreciate any thoughts and feedback! \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/TcKHhkE",

        "body": "If it does stay emulsified, I'd be concerned that some of your ingredients are not what they should be, or the surfactants didn't end up in the final product at all. Or, because I've been wrong before and I'm feeling cynical today, you are a master chemist here to troll or pwn or flex or dab or whatever and yes I'm an old and should go shout at the clouds.\n\nTrying to be funny so that I don't sound like a total killjoy. I'm not trying to be a jerk, but your formula doesn't make sense to me.\n\nYou put an anionic surfactant in a cationic emulsion. In my experience, that's going to become gritty and chunky and separate. If it is in that tub, do poke through to the bottom to make sure that it hasn't separated before using it each time.\n\nSCI is chemically incompatible with BTMS and CETAC. SCI can be used at about that concentration with a true non-ionic surfactant based emulsifying wax to make a cream product, but when I've done it the result has been very thick and not pleasant for using on hair. (Yes, I know that people use BTMS with SCI in shampoo bars, but it isn't an aqueous solution or emulsion so the incompatible charges aren't an issue.)\n\n10% SCI won't stay fluid for long in any case. 7% CAPB isn't typically enough to keep it as a paste, not for me anyway, and it won't keep it suspended in an emulsion. It'll crystalize and fall out like the uncooperative spiteful princess of an ingredient that it is.\n\nI have mixed CETAC into CAPB as part of a liquid shampoo, because I wanted to see this unusual chemistry quirk for myself. It is noted in a patent for a shampoo. It can, but there's no real point to it. Now we have cationic polymers that are designed to work in anionic surfactant products.\n\nIf you remove the SCI and CAPB, you've got a conditioner. If you want to leave it on your head for any period of time, you should reduce or probably leave the CETAC out of future versions. It's much weaker than BTMS and you probably wouldn't notice the difference.\n\nThe original has less than 1% olive oil. It can go rancid quickly and doesn't add anything beyond being oily. Coconut oil would be better, as it has a much longer life and might have real benefits to hair. Babassu oil would be even better because it has the good characteristics of coconut oil while being silkier.\n\nAlso, that's rather a lot of essential oils and menthol. Twice as much as I would consider a safe maximum. It doesn't have to burn to work, I promise.\n\nIf you want to make a close dupe, use anionic surfactants. Cetearyl Alcohol and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is an anionic emulsfying wax (trade names include Crodex A and Lanette W). They add some Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, probably for rinsibility. At best this product has a pH of 6.5, but possibly up to 8. If I were going to attempt this I would use glyceryl stearate SE and DLS.\n\nIf it ever contained CETAC, it was more than 5 years ago from what I could find in old ingredients lists for Lush Roots. But without a zwitterion like CAPB to do the magic, it could never have contained it in any useful amount. CAPB by itself is likely to destabilize an anionic emulsion, but CETAC would make one fail.\n\nA way to make a less close but more similar than a conditioner dupe, and the one I would suggest, would be to use a non-ionic emulsifying wax. A lotion with 5% emulsifying wax (either polysorbate 60 or ceteareth 20, the latter being more silky), a cationic polymer, and no more than 10% oils & oil soluble ingredients, makes for a surprisingly good pre-wash conditioner.",

Any others who use/ have used their products? \n\nHey, first time poster here but a huge fan of the sub! I've been through many products the last year or so trying to find new products for my hair that fit me. I have long silky and straight hair but it gets easily split ends and can get very tangled in the mornings..\n\nI have recently tried a new brand though - the biosilk shampoo and conditioner plus silk treatment. I have paid much for hair salon shampoo and conditioners but these did not work as good as the biosilk products. I'm very surprised how good they work for my hair, the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair instantly combable after showering, which I've never experienced before!

I thought, yeah well, seems like a natural shampoo, lemme use it on Non-oily hair days. But woah, I was surprised.\n\nAs stated, My hair is very, very dry and gets tangled a lot. Need to wash my hair twice when they've been oiled, leading to them getting dried further. I can't imagine the status of my hair without a conditioner and a Leave-In serum. And then I used this product from which I had zero expectations. \n\nIt is foaming enough to clean my hair in one wash, and my hair feels voluminous. They are less dry, appearing softer than usual. I love how my hair feels after every wash. \n\nI can't comment if it helps with reducing hairfall or dandruff, but I haven't noticed an increase too, so I guess it's okay.\n\nFor the ingredients list, I can't comment if they're being shady or not. I don't know much about this brand as this is the first product I've used, and I'm impressed. I'll probably repurchase, and this product has impressed me enough to try their other haircare range.",

I used to use just any regular shampoo, conditioner and soap twice a day supposedly to remove chlorine after each pool session but apparently it’s not working because I still smell like chlorine. I used to not care much about the smell of chlorine that lingers on my hair and skin but I do mind the damage. My dark brown, fine, straight hair does dry out and changes to lighter color plus my skin is perpetually dry.\n\nI am trying to be more caring to my hair and skin this year, I make sure to shower before getting into the pool, I have added a clarifying shampoo weekly and applying hair masks whenever I feel like the ends of my hair needs it which lately is looking like I have to do it more about 3x a week. Side note, my scalp is extremely oily too so I’m only using the hair mask on the bottom half of my hair. My hair mask has a really strong fragrance too and it kinda hides the chlorine smell from my hair. \n\nReading up on some posts, I probably need a chelating shampoo. Usual chlorine-neutralizing shampoo brands like ultraswim  are not readily available in my country and it’ll be super expensive if I try to order one so I researched a bit more and I figured I need any product with EDTA. \n\nSo anyway, I found this baby hair and body wash and I saw that it has EDTA in the ingredients. Can I use this as my shampoo and shower gel after a session in the pool? Would this remove chlorine or would buying and using this be a bad idea? I’ll list the ingredients below:\n\nIngredients: Purified Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Whey Filtrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum, Citric Acid, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Benzoic Acid, Lactic Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nWould really appreciate any opinions or advice.

A lot of the shampoos and conditioners I used back then had an EDTA in them at the bottom of the ingredient list, but they did not remove the hard water buildup from my hair, and I had to buy an actual chelating shampoo to address the buildup issue. Have you checked the ingredients on shampoos you’ve used in the past to see if any of them have an EDTA?\n\nI think the SLES in that shampoo could probably be a big help in cleansing your hair, especially if you were using something sulfate-free before. But if that doesn’t work, could you ask a hairstylist in your country for product recommendations?\n\nIf Bumble and bumble products are sold in your country, I found their Sunday shampoo worked great for chelating.",

In this case, tetrasodium EDTA is the second-to-last ingredient listed, which means it is a very low quantity in the product, however higher up in the list is citric acid, another chelating agent.  So it might work!  You could give it a shot.  \n\nPer [this article](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/your-hair-on-chlorine.html) in my favorite hair science blog, applying coconut oil or conditioner to your hair before your swim can help protect it from the damaging effects of chlorine. \n\nI have also heard of people who have had success keeping their hair completely dry while swimming by wearing two swim caps at the same time (making sure they both have a pretty snug fit), but even just one cap that still lets some water in would help somewhat.\n\nAnd then as far as removing the smell / treating it afterwards, you can try to find a chelating shampoo/body wash, or there are DIY chelation remedies as well.  In the article I linked above, it has a recipe for doing a hair rinse with diluted citric acid.\n\nThat same blog has [another article on hard water](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/03/hard-water-and-your-hair.html) and using chelating agents for removing minerals, it lists some products that you might look for, and chelating ingredients to look for in your products if you don't find those specific products.",

Rinsing your hair will have the shampoo run down your strands to clean them. You can also consider combing once your hair is saturated with conditioner and not rinsing all of it out.",

I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up? What do you guys think? I have thick wavy/curly hair. Also, how do you know if your hair is moisturized? I always thought soft silky elastic hair = moisturized which is why I am writing this post because it no longer feels soft and silky, it feels rough.\n\nHeres the Shampoo  https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133656/Kirkland-Moisture-Shampoo/Unlisted-Brand/Hair \n\nIngredients: water sodium cocoyl isethionate cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine methyl isethionate disodium cocoyl glutamate sodium lauryl sulfoacetate decyl glecoside ammonium cocoyl isethionate divinyldimethicond/dimethicone copolymer disodium laureth sulfosuccinate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract glycol disterate glycerin fragrance quaternium-91 sodium cocoyl glutamate peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate amodimethicone panthenol polyquaternium-10 ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate chlorphenesin methyl gluceth-20 guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride c11-15 pareth-7 laureth-9 phospholipids hydrolyzed vegetable protein pg-propyl silanetriol c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate trideceth-12 superoxide dismutase sodium ascorbyl phosphate tocopheryl acetate methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone\n\nConditioner: http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133657/KIRKLAND-MOISTURE-CONDITIONER/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water cyclopentasiloxane cetearyl alcohol stearyl alcohol cetrimonium chloride behentrimonium methosulfate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract helianthus annus (sunflower) seed extract glycereth-26 dimethiconol divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer fragrance gluconolactone cetrimonium bromide panthenol ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate jojoba esters quaternium-91 amodimethicone hydroxyethylcelloulose cetrimonium methosulfate sodium benzoate c11-15 pareth-7 peg-45m laureth-9 aminomethly propanol glycerin butyrospermum parkii ( shea butter) c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride (sunscreens) trideceth-12 citric acid ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate sodium ascorbyl phosphate butylene glycol hydrolyed soy protein tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) hydrolyzed vegatable protein pg-propyl silanetriol\n\nedit: Some more info, My hair is just above shoulder length, when i get in the shower i use a wide tooth comb to get rid of knots then i soak my hair with warm water then lather the shampoo all over scalp and from root to end then rinse then i take a huge blob of Conditioner and use it the same way and leave it in for 1-2 minutes then rinse with cold water.\n\nThanks for the help!

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a bit of a haircare/hair science newbie, and I searched the sub and combed through the wiki to try to figure this out myself, but I’m still at a loss, probably because I just don’t quite understand which haircare ingredients do what. Anyway, all this to say that I’m sorry if this has been asked or covered before. I just couldn’t find it on my own. If there are any posts you think I should refer to, please link it below!\n\n\nI recently tried the Pureology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner set, and after rinsing out the conditioner, I could immediately tell that my hair felt softer. After drying, my hair was much smoother/less frizzy, had a lot of body, and was the shiniest I’ve ever seen it. My parents, who have never commented on my hair, even said that my hair looked really healthy when we were FaceTiming. Given that the price of the products makes me want to cry, I’m hoping to get some help in figuring out what exactly is in it that my hair really loves, and I want to see if I can find those ingredients in other shampoos/conditioners. \n\n\nA little bit about my hair:\n\n\nI have thin, low porosity (I think), fine, black hair. My ends are drier and I have a very oily scalp. The oily scalp is very odd to me because I am extremely dry everywhere else on my body, but my scalp has always been oily.\n\n\nI wash and condition my hair every night, wrap in an Aquis microfiber towel for a while, remove the towel, spray It’s A 10 leave-in lite, then dry my hair with a hairdryer. I’ve tried not washing my hair every day, but it just gets too oily by the second day and my hair gets stringy and looks limp. Sometimes I will use dry shampoo, but I find that it just feels like there’s a lot of gunk in my hair and I break out on my scalp. \n\n\nFor the past couple of years, I’ve used Matrix Biolage Ultra Hydrasource Shampoo and ultra Hydrasource conditioning balm. I’ve also used the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo/conditioner set on the days I have to wash dry shampoo out of my hair because I feel like the tea tree helps with the breakouts. For deep conditioning, I used the briogeo don’t despair repair conditioning mask, but honestly that just felt like an everyday conditioner to me, and I would mix that in with the tea tree conditioner because I didn’t feel like the Paul Mitchell one did anything for my hair. Currently I’m using the living proof restore hair mask in the same way. When I ran out of the matrix set, I switched over to the Bondi Boost hair growth shampoo and conditioner because when I finally was able to get a hair cut, my hairdresser told me that I had lost a lot of hair. Although I think it was due to stress and the fact that I couldn’t go get my hair done because COVID and I live in a different state than my home state for grad school, so my hair got really long and I don’t think it was very healthy (but it also looked really good after the Pureology set, and it looks even better now that I got a haircut and feel like my hair is a bit healthier than before). The Pureology was used here and there throughout my time with these aforementioned products, mainly because I was trying to make the product last longer, but each time I use it, I notice an immediate difference. \n\n\nPlease let me know if there’s any other info you need to know about my hair, and thanks in advance for reading this post and for any insight you might have for me!\n\n\nShampoo Infredients:\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Glycol Distearate, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Glycereth-26, Panthenol, Parfum/Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Ppg-5-Ceteth-20, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyquaternium-10, Amodimethicone, Peg-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Carbomer, C11-15 Pareth-7, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Laureth-9, Glycerin, C12-13 Pareth-23, Benzyl Alcohol, C12-13 Pareth-3, Trideceth-12, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Magnesium Nitrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Isopropyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Melanin, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Pentylene Glycol, Bht, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nConditioner Ingredients\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Benzoic Acid, Trideceth-6, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Potassium Hydroxide, Caramel, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, CI 15985/Yellow 6, CI 14700/Red 4, BHT, Melanin, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

If I’d realised in advance I’d have hoarded it. I’m in Australia and can only find US eBay resellers now. \n\nI loved this cleanser because it made my skin feel clean but not TOO CLEAN and soft, brightened and evened out my skin tone, and never caused redness. I’m looking for a similar replacement, does anybody have any ideas? \n\nHere’s some more info that may help:\n\n- combination skin — nose can be oily, cheeks can be dry \n- I think kaolin may be the ingredient my skin responded so well to, as my skin also really likes Lush’s Angels on Bare Skin (but I don’t want to use that every day). I’ve also generally responded well to salicylic acid and probiotic products.\n- I’m not actually prone to acne, a Sephora assistant recced this because I was trying to deal with a painful recurring pimple. That pimple is still occasionally recurring, I think it may actually be some kind of curse. My skin in general still noticeably improved so I continued using it.\n- My skin is moderately but unpredictably sensitive, I’m generally fine with fragrances and exfoliants but I think that benzyl alcohol specifically might cause redness and stinging. Phenoxyethanol, parabens, essential oils etc seem fine. \n- I prefer a cream, oil or milk cleanser. \n- Willing to spend up to about AU$40 (US$30). \n\nIngredients of this cleanser: *Active Ingredient: Salicylic Acid 2% Acne Aqua (Water, Eau), Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Bentonite, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Kaolin, Charcoal Powder, Chrysanthemum Parthenium Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Yogurt Extract, Mel (Honey, Miel), Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Quartz, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Tetrasodium EDTA, EDTA, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\nThanks for your help everybody!",

Two times on it's own (paired with a hair mask and oil so it's not so drying) and last time I used it once and cleansed a second time with a regular shampoo (+mask+oil).\n\n(I have to mention the ketoconazole shampoo isn't a notorious one, so I will list the ingredients: AQUA, SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE, DISODIUM LAURETH SULFOSUCCINATE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, KETOCONAZOLE 2% W/W, TETRASODIUM EDTA, SODIUM CHLORIDE HYDROXYETHYL CELLULOSE, BHA, METHYLPARABEN, PROPYLPARABEN, CI 454330) \n\nI did put my mom search my scalp and she found a flaky patch by my ear, but the entire rest of the scalp was very much clean. \n\nI will continue to use this shampoo once per week and adjust accordingly. \n\nI'm very much happy with the results!",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it’s definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 – 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don’t use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I’ve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life’s problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I’ve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn’t been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn’t feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I’m kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don’t have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I’m trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn’t help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it’s supposed to be “protective” according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn’t ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can’t verify (it cited the manufacturer’s website but I can’t find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can’t tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I’m trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement. Thank you 🙏🏻🖤\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Shampoo:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamide DIPA, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, Polyquaternium 10, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Sodium Gluconate, Glucose, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Conditioner:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Chloride, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Tocotrienols, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyquaternium-4, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance/Parfum, Citric Acid, Cyclohexasiloxane, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**HealthySexyHair Conditioner:** Water (Aqua, Eau), Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Isopropyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-37, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/ Dicaprate, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Silicone Quaternium-22, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Hydroxy-ethylcellulose, Sodium PCA, Propylene Glycol, Quaternium-80, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone,Panthenol, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, C11-15 Pareth-7, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Magnesium Nitrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Palmitamidopro- pyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Magnesium Chloride, Trisodium HEDTA, Acacia Dealbata Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Moonstone Extract (lol), Fragrance (Parfum), Methylchloroisothiazolinone,Methylisothiazolinone, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Glyoxal, Sodium Nitrate, Limonene.",

    "body": "Heya! New here, so I want to give an introduction. My hair is probably 3B or 3C, somewhere in there. Very coarse and thick with a lot of frizz. Tons of volume and kind of stiff, if that makes sense. When I pull a hair out it is not cylindrical like you tend to think of hair being, it is more flat like a ribbon, usually with little kinks in it in addition to the curl. Is this common in curly hair? Growing up I had a hard time with my hair because it was so different and neither my parents nor my hairdressers really seemed to know what to do with hair texture like mine, and I didn't know what to do with it. I grew up with being told to shampoo and brush it every day, so I had a big frizzy mess. When I was 14 and discovered flat irons I began straightening it daily, and in addition to frequent dyeing it became very damaged. I have only begun to be interested in the idea of wearing my hair curly in the last year or two. I am now 28, have had short hair since I was 14, and have been fighting my curl my whole life until now. I am no longer straightening it often, although I do still dye it at home about every other month. I want it soft and less frizzy, and to grow it out to be big and bold. When it is straight it is currently a little past shoulder length. I currently brush it about once a week, I wash with head and shoulders \"smooth and silky\" shampoo, condition with head and shoulders \"smooth and silky\" conditioner, and sometimes I apply a moisturizing product right out of the shower, like this detangling smoothing product from pantene I have. Sometimes I mix it with a silicone serum, which I know I will have to nix. Once it is dry I use a tresemme curling mousse in it, again I sometimes use some silicone serum at that point also. I first heard about the CG routine a few years ago and was interested in it, but at that point I didn't plan on ever styling my hair curly. Now that I am wanting to wear my hair curly I am reading up on CG.... The main problem that comes to mind is finding a cg-friendly, sulfate-free anti-dandruff shampoo.\n\n I have really bad dandruff, and it is not caused by dry scalp, my skin is actually really oily and I live in a very high humidity location. I think it is the kind caused by overgrown fungus. Anyway, Head & Shoulders is working really well for me, but I want to try the CG routine and I can't find anti-dandruff products without sulfates. Looking for product suggestions. Please no tea tree products, my skin reacts to it. Some ingredients I try to avoid normally are: keratin (my hair gets crispy when I use it,) any tea tree oil in any concentration in any product (gt itchy, stinging scalp that develops a rash over repeated applications,) limonene or similar citrus derivative (irritates my skin,) I try to avoid fragrance (skin irritation) although if I do buy a product with fragrance I usually check if it is low on the ingredients list, in which case it sometimes is safe for me. Sometimes certain botanical extracts irritate my scalp also, although I do not know which ones. I feel like I am really limited with my skin sensitivities. The product that has worked best on my hair, in my opinion, is Olive Miracle which I believe is by African Pride but it began irritating my scalp, probably from the tea tree oil in it.\n\nEDIT: Found this product: https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/hair-care/products/shampoo/everfresh-antidandruff-shampoo.aspx?shade=antidandruff-shampoo\nIt is sulfate-free and contains the same active ingredient that is currently working well for my hair. However, it contains ingredients that sound similar to sulfates: disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, sodium lauryl suloacetate. Are those kinds of things really better than regular ol' sulfates? Could I co-wash with this conditioner?",

It's hit or miss if that's okay for you, like most things; for me, I need the gentler sulfates because they remove build up a lot better.\n\nI know you tried products with tea tree oil, but have you tried neem oil? To me, it's gentler but has the same anti fungal properties. I will warn you that it smells really funny.\n\nI use a shampoo brush to help distribute product and exfoliate the scalp.

    "body": "Hi curlies, I need some help troubleshooting. I feel like I have zero way to predict whether my scalp will like a shampoo or not; some with supposedly \"harsher\" ingredients work great for me and others that are \"gentler\" make me super dry and itchy! I have to stick to low-poo because my low-porosity, medium-thickness 2C hair gets weighed down really easily. I desperately want to experiment with new shampoos but I have no way of narrowing down which ones might work for me!!\n\nHere are some of the products I've tried, how my scalp liked them, and their ingredients.\n\nTHE BODY SHOP GINGER SHAMPOO - Somehow? this is the nicest of all the shampoos I've ever tried on my scalp?? I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm. I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky. The worst of the bunch.\n\nIngredients: Water, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates Copolymer, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Histidine, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO SCALP REVIVAL MICRO-EXFOLIATING SHAMPOO - This one feels pretty good, but sometimes it leaves my hair feeling too \"squeaky clean\" and I'm not sure if I should be exfoliating my scalp every wash day. \n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Glyceryl Stearate*, Glycerin*, Microcrystalline Cellulose*, Cocamidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Hydrogenated Castor Oil*, Lithium Magnesium Sodium Silicate, Panthenol, Xylitylglucoside*, Charcoal Powder*, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil*, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil*, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil*, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil*, Anhydroxylitol*, Bisabolol, Menthyl Lactate*, Xylitol*, Polyquaternium-7, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance (Parfum), Citric Acid*, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO BLOSSOM & BLOOM VOLUMIZING SHAMPOO (which I guess was recently discontinued?) - Feels pretty good as well, some itchiness.\n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Glycerin*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate*, Polysorbate 80*, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate*, Soyamidopropyldimethylamine Oxide*, Maltodextrin*, Biotin, Panthenol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate*, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Sodium C14-18 Olefin Sulfonate*, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate*, Polyquaternium-7, Polyquaternium-71, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO CURL CHARISMA SHAMPOO - Moderate itchiness on my scalp and also just way too heavy for my hair.\n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Glycerin*, Glycol Distearate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract*, Rice Amino Acids*, Lactobacillus/Tomato Fruit Ferment Extract*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil*, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil*, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract*, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Keratin Amino Acids*, Coconut Acid*, Hydrolyzed Quinoa*, Sodium Hyaluronate*, Acyl Coenzyme A Desaturase*, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil*, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil*, Polyquaternium-71, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Isethionate, Polyquaternium-7, Anhydroxylitol*, Xylitylglucoside*, Xylitol*, Fragrance (Parfum), Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

I’m happy to keep using that as my shampoo but I’ve been trying to work out what the ingredient that seems to make my scalp angry is so I can avoid it in other products, and I’m starting to think it could be polyquaternium 10 (or polyquaternium in general). The body shop shampoo doesn’t have it in, but I’ve tried the only curls cleanser & umberto giannini scalp restore and got really itchy both times - and they both have polyquaternium 10 in! It could just be complete coincidence though obviously! I’ve also found I get slightly itchy with boots extra firm mousse which has polyquaternium 16. \n\nI’ve also found that my hair feels instantly dry (as in not wet, not as in straw like) to the touch soon as the water isn’t on it when I’m washing it as if there is a film on it and that doesn’t happen with the body shop shampoo either. \n\nI could be completely off the mark here but I’ve never seen anyone else have the same issue!",

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\**Hydrolyzed Proteins*\n\n* Hydrolyzed Elastin, silk, keratin, collagen \n* Peptides (wheat, oat, soy...)\n* Amino acids (wheat, oat, soy) or glycine, alanine, proline, etc.\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein, i.e. keratin, silk, rice, soy)\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n*For Use In Humid Weather​*\n\n* Vegetable glycerin\n* ​Sorbitol\n\n*Plant Gels*\n\n* Panthenol\n* Flax Seed Gel\n* Okra Gel\n* Aloe Vera\n* Hydroxyethylcellulose\n* Pectin\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Guar Gum\n* Marshmallow Root\n* Slippery Elm​\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Soluble Silicones **Definition:** This ingredient coats the hair shaft to lock in moisture, reduce frizz, add slip, and give hair the coveted soft and silky feel. Soluble silicones can be washed out with non surfactant cleansers. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n* Bis-peg/ppg-16/16 peg/ppg-16/16 (This is an emulsifier - not for shine or lubrication)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Dimethicone copolyol\n* DEA PG-Propyl PEG/PPG-18/21 Dimethicone\n* Dimethicone PEG-8 Phosphate\n* Dimethicone-PG Diethylmonium Chloride\n* Hydrolyzed Silk PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol Crosspolymer\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat protein/hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and cystine/silicone co-polymers\n* Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Silanetriol\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol\n* Lauryl methicone copolyol\n* PEG-40/PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl/Hydropropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG/PPG-14/4 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PEG-12 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl, Hydroxypropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG-7 Amodimethicone\n* PEG-8 Disteramonium Chloride PG-Dimethicone\n* PEG-33 (and) PEG-8 Dimethicone (and) PEG-14\n* Silanetriol\n* Silicone Quaternium-8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Plant Oils **Definition:** This ingredient is used to retain moisture, condition hair, protect from damage and minimize dryness. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair.  **Ingredients:**\n\n* Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) Oil \n* Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil\n* Olive (Olea Europaea) Oil\n* Argan (Argania Spinosa) Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Preservatives **Definition:** Additives that prevent spoilage. Most consumer products contain preservatives because without them any water-based solution will eventually grow mold or bacteria. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** A routine is not applicable for this category since it's included in most products, but pay attention to whether your products cause scalp irritation. That could be a sign to switch to, or alternate with, preservative free options.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Potassium Sorbate \n* Benzoic acid\n* Dehydroacetic acid\n\n*​Sources:* [*Cationic Compounds in Cosmetics*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/search?q=surfactants)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Detergents Which Remove: Silicone*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/detergents-which-remove-silicones.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog​*[*Essentials of Hair Care Often Neglected: Hair Cleansing*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)*, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)*[*Glycerin and Humidity*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/glycerin-and-humidity.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Film Forming Humectants - What They Are And Why You Need Them*](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/film-forming-humectants-what-they-are.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*",

    "body": "Below is a list I have compiled of all of the chemicals used in industrial manufacturing of everything from food to hygiene products that are derived from coconut and/or palm. There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

    "body": "I've worn my ring for more than 2 years while doing dishes, taking a shower, cleaning the house with various cleaners.....  I don't use much for caustic cleaners or things that leave a lot of residue due to the number of pets we have so I rarely have to worry about damaging the ring and only occasionally take it off first.\n\nSomehow while giving the fluffy husky a bath I rather severely burnt my finger.  I don't have anything that can focus well enough to take a pic and my husband has not been interested in helping with his amazing quality phone camera.  The dog shampoo had not arrived yet so I used plain unscented dawn dish soap to get the worst dirt off and then human moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  The problem happened before I applied the new dog specific after bath coat conditioner for helping her excess fluff slide out and that was a spray I didn't really get on myself so everything I used was the same as I have repeatedly in other situations.  \n\n\nInitially I thought the flexible plastic brush with it's hand strap and finger loop were merely pushing the bulky ring into my finger.  I have very small hands and this is the widest and sharpest edged ring I've ever worn.  So I assumed despite trying to keep my finger farther back and avoid pushing on the ring the occasional times it did were the reason for the mild discomfort and red line on the back of my finger.  \n\n\nThe next morning that red line was a huge raised red welt in a strip as wide a the ring with larger areas that matched the spacing of the electrodes.  I decided it was most definitely not just from the ring digging in.  I moved my ring to my other hand.  It's continued to work as normal.  By evening I had 3 large blisters that broke and scabbed over.  While those healed during the next several days little itchy blisters appeared along the edges of the still large raised red welt across the back of my finger.  I heal fast so it was slightly concerning that this wound showed practically no sign of improving.  \n\n\nFinally over a week later new blisters stopped forming, the raised area suddenly went down practically overnight, and the damaged skin is peeling off.  I've always had a tendency to find ways to burn myself while cooking, fireworks(even sparklers), and once I melted some fine copper wire strands to the side of my finger in a rewiring oopsy on a low voltage device.  I'm pretty sure I have never managed to get a burn this severe.    \n\n\nUnfortunately I can't really tell you what the catalyst was given I've used all the same products in other situations and rinsed each one off thoroughly before the next.  The only unique thing in this incident was dog fur.  Doing dishes for hours, taking long showers with soaps, scrubbing the dogs with dry shampoo spray or wipes, wiping off the kitchen counters with mild chlorine based disinfectant (not at all similar to bleach), dusting with pledge, and mopping the floor with an oura ring on has not resulted in any problems.    \n\n\nMaybe soap covered dog fur can short out an oura ring?  Don't know but of all the things you do while wearing an oura ring apparently don't wash the dog. :P   \n\n\n  \n\n\nShampoo and conditioner used:  \n OGX coconut milk nourishing shampoo- Active Ingredients: Aqua (Water); Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate;  Cocamidopropyl Betaine; Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine; Parfum; Glycol  Distearate; Dimethicone Copolyol; Cetyl Alcohol; Cocamide DEA; Guar  Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride; Polyquaternium-11; DMDM Hydantoin;  Panthenol; Silk Amino Acids; Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Extract; Albumen;  Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil; Hydrolyzed Milk Protein; Tocopheryl  Acetate (Vitamin E); Coumarin \n\n&#x200B;\n\nogx coconut milk conditioner- Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride,  Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit  Extract, Glycol Stearate, Glycol Distearate, Ceteareth-20, Isopropyl  Alcohol, Dimethicone, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Citric Acid,  Cyclopentasiloxane, Panthenol, Ovum (Egg Powder), Propylene Glycol,  Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone,  Methylisothiazolinone, Fragrance (Parfum).",

I almost could not remove the ring due to the swelling.\n\nI thought, perhaps, it was a spider bite but that didn't make sense, especially because no other \"bites\" were found on my exposed skin. \n\nI also believe that the ring burned me. Perhaps, in my sleep, the sensors twisted toward the top of my finger where the delicate skin is as opposed to staying positioned underneath on the palm side my hand.\n\n I seem to recall when I initially received the ring that the literature stated to keep the sensors on the under side of your hand. Is that because they know it has the potential to burn the sensitive skin on the top of your hand?\n\nThis is unfortunate. I love my ring.",

Those pimples that form at night will either become whiteheads at the morning or the night the very next day and again with a fair amount of pus, sometimes with blood. Irritating. I wash my face x2 a day with facial cleanser and moisturize with aloe vera gel 98%.

Also i like to mention that i do wash my pillow constantly but that doesnt seem to work.

First it was only on her groin, but now she got it on the rest of the body too - basically it looks like dandruff. \n\nI took Truffle to the dermatologist and she told me its nothing serious and to wash her with an oat shampoo. She recommended me one but it has SLS and I'm not sure about using it - is it not that good for hair and skin as it is with humans? I also found few different ones, but I don't think I know enough about dog hair and skin to pick the best one. \n\nI figured itd be best to ask professionals, I hope it's not a bad place to ask this question.

Whole leaf aloe can be an allergen it is the inner leaf gel that is safer, propylene glycol os another potentail allergen but you will likely have encounted that in other products recently.\n\nI have a feeling either potassium sorbate or sorbic acid can cause flushing for some people.

I will Google and edit this post if I can work it out.\n\n**ETA** *\"Sorbic acid/potassium sorbate - effective at a very acidic pH (eg 5) – good against mould and fungus and somewhat effective against bacteria.

SLS is a  common ingredient in many personal care products, such as shampoos,  soaps, and toothpaste. It is a surfactant, which means it helps to break  up oils and dirt, creating a lather that allows the product to clean  effectively. However, some people may experience irritation or  sensitivity to SLS, and therefore, opt for SLS-free products.\n\nSLS is a synthetic chemical compound, but it is derived from natural  sources. SLS is typically made from the fatty acids found in coconut or  palm kernel oil, which are natural substances. However, during the  manufacturing process, these fatty acids undergo several chemical  reactions, including sulfation and neutralization, to create Sodium  Lauryl Sulphate. So, while SLS is derived from natural sources, it is  considered a synthetic ingredient due to the chemical processing it  undergoes.\n\n**Is** **Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) bad?**\n\nSome potential drawbacks of SLS include:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Skin irritation: SLS may cause skin irritation, dryness, or redness  for some people, particularly those with sensitive skin or pre-existing  skin conditions such as eczema or dermatitis.  \n \n2. Eye irritation: If products containing SLS come into contact with the eyes, it can cause irritation or discomfort.  \n \n3. Stripping natural oils: SLS can strip the skin and hair of their  natural oils, leading to dryness and potential damage. This is a concern  for people with dry or delicate hair.  \n \n4. Environmental impact: Although SLS is considered biodegradable,  there are concerns about its production process, which involves palm  kernel or coconut oil. Palm oil production has been associated with  deforestation and habitat destruction.\n\nIt is essential to note that reactions to SLS vary from person to  person. Some individuals use products containing SLS without any issues,  while others might experience adverse effects. Not everyone will be  allergic to SLS. If you have concerns about SLS, you can look for  SLS-free products or consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional  for advice tailored to your specific needs.\n\n**How is Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) made?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Extraction of fatty acids: The fatty acids are extracted from the  plant source, usually through a process called hydrolysis. This involves  breaking down the triglycerides found in the oils into their  constituent fatty acids and glycerol.  \n \n2. Production of lauryl alcohol: The extracted fatty acids are then  converted into lauryl alcohol (also known as dodecanol) through a  hydrogenation process. Hydrogenation involves adding hydrogen to the  fatty acid molecules under high pressure and temperature, in the  presence of a catalyst.  \n \n3. Sulfation: Lauryl alcohol is reacted with sulphur trioxide (SO3) to  produce lauryl sulphate. This reaction, called sulfation, involves  adding a sulphate group (SO4) to the lauryl alcohol molecule.  \n \n4. Neutralization: Finally, lauryl sulphate is neutralized with an  alkali, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH), to  produce Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) or Potassium Lauryl Sulphate  (KLS), respectively.\n\n**Are there alternatives to Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS)?**\n\nThere are several alternatives to Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) that  can be used in personal care products as surfactants or foaming agents.  If you are seeking an SLS free option, then some of the below will be  what to look out for.\n\nSome of the more common alternatives include:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Sodium Coco-sulphate (SCS): This surfactant is derived from coconut  oil and is like SLS but considered milder. Although it shares some  similarities with SLS, some people find it less irritating.  \n \n2. Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate (SLSa): SLSa is a milder and less  irritating alternative to SLS. It is derived from coconut and palm oils  and provides good foaming and cleansing properties.  \n \n3. Cocamidopropyl Betaine: Derived from coconut oil, cocamidopropyl  betaine is a gentle surfactant and conditioning agent that is often used  in combination with other surfactants to create milder formulations.  \n \n4. Decyl Glucoside: This is a mild, non-ionic surfactant derived from  plant-based sources, such as corn or coconut. It is biodegradable and  suitable for sensitive skin.  \n \n5. Coco-glucoside: Another plant-based, non-ionic surfactant,  coco-glucoside is derived from coconut and fruit sugars. It is gentle  and effective for sensitive skin and hair.  \n \n6. Lauryl Glucoside: A mild, non-ionic surfactant made from coconut or  palm oil and glucose, lauryl glucoside is often used in baby and  sensitive skin products.  \n \n7. Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate: This surfactant is less irritating than SLS and provides good cleansing and foaming properties.\n\nAnother ingredient that is often used to replace SLS in shampoo is **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**  (CAPB). CAPB is a mild surfactant and foaming agent derived from  coconut oil and used in personal care products such as shampoos, body  washes, and facial cleansers.\n\nCAPB is known for its gentle cleansing properties and is often used  in combination with other surfactants to reduce potential irritation. It  also has conditioning properties, which can help to soften and detangle  hair. As a result, it is commonly found in products formulated for  sensitive skin or those marketed as being mild or gentle. So, seeing  this in a beard shampoo makes sense.\n\nWhile Cocamidopropyl Betaine is considered to be a safer and milder  alternative to more aggressive surfactants like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate  (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), some individuals may still  experience irritation or allergic reactions to CAPB. However, such  reactions are generally less common compared to stronger surfactants.\n\nWhen looking for an alternative to SLS, it's essential to consider  the specific product and your skin or hair type. Many people with  sensitive skin or allergies find that these alternatives cause less  irritation or dryness compared to SLS. However, individual reactions may  vary, so it's a good idea to test a new product on a small area before  full use.\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nSodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) does not cause issues for everyone, and  some people can use products containing SLS without any adverse effects.  However, it is essential to recognise that even some SLS alternatives  can be potential irritants for certain individuals. It is not a  one-size-fits-all situation, as everyone's skin and hair may react  differently to various ingredients.\n\nWhen trying out any new product, it is always wise to perform a patch  test first. Apply a small amount of the product to a discreet area of  skin and wait for at least 24 hours to check for any signs of irritation  or an allergic reaction. This precautionary step can help you avoid any  unpleasant surprises when using the product more extensively.\n\nIf you have already found a product that works well for you and does  not cause any irritation, it is advisable to stick with it. However, if  you are in search of something new, consider exploring products  specifically formulated for sensitive skin, particularly when it comes  to facial and hair care products. These formulations often contain  milder ingredients and are less likely to cause irritation or other  adverse reactions.\n\nRemember that finding the right personal care products may require  some experimentation, as individual preferences and sensitivities vary.  Always pay attention to your skin's and hair's response to a product and  adjust your choices accordingly to maintain their health and  well-being.",

Generally things that contain silicone substances can buildup easily in hair, and will usually require a stronger surfectant to remove.\n\nThe amodimethicone would be water soluble if it had both trideceth-12 AND centrimonium chloride, but it seems to be missing the chloride part of the equation so I would say that is a likely culprit. \n\nAlso the divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer is water insoluble, which needs a stronger surfectant to remove.",

I want to understand why so I can avoid that happening again when I get new CG approved products.\n\nShampoo disaster- In August 2019 I unintentionally tried a CG approved shampoo according to isitcg: Soapbox Coconut Oil Shampoo (see ingredients  below). The first two times were okay, but every time since then my hair has a terrible reaction. It makes my hair ridiculously tangled and matted, almost gummy? Yet simultaneously dry as straw at the bottom? No amount of conditioner helps. It makes it terribly difficult to brush/comb and consequently I lose a bunch of hair. \n\nWhy might this have happened? It is very confusing and makes me very nervous to switch to a CG shampoo, despite the non-CG one I am currently using causing some other smaller issues.  \n\nSomeone else suggested maybe my hair doesn’t like coconut oil, but I’ve always used products with it since 2012. They also said it sounds like protein overload, which it does sound like that, but the Soapbox shampoo does not have protein as far as I can tell...?  \n\nFor context, I think I have 2A-2B wavy hair that has low porosity at the top and maybe medium at the bottom. I have very thick, fine hair that gets very frizzy in humidity. Where I live has 90% humidity most of the time. It basically doesn’t grow beyond my shoulders and just breaks off. It’s very prone to oil and grease at the top, but always dry at the bottom. Products cause nasty build up at the top, and sometimes are absorbed a little at the bottom and it is gross. It takes at least 2.5 hours to air dry, usually closer to 4. I live in a mostly hot, very humid climate. CG approved shampoo I unintentionally used in the past had a lot of protein and glycerin in it. Sometimes glycerin was the second ingredient.\n\n\nSoapbox Coconut Shampoo Ingredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Panthenol, Polyquaternium-11, Polyquaternium-7, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

At evening I face wash, wait around half an hour and use medicine, then after next half, I use cream if my face is dry. I try not to squeeze, and if it happens, I disinfect it. I'm eating very healthy; now paleo; mainly veggies and meat with little sweets, going vegan don't make any difference to my skin.

However, after burning my face with benzol peroxide, I'm talking red and extremely puffy for 3 days, I realized that all of these acids and what not are just terrible. I was looking on my moms Pinterest acct and YouTube and found tons of healthy ways to try getting rid of acne. Try minimizing to a very simple gentle face wash like cetaphil, something for non acne. Watch videos about apple cider vinegar for acne, it can possibly be a miracle worker. Also read about aloe Vera, also a miracle worker. A face mask I recommend is using an egg with cinnamon, it burns but is very effective if you face doesn't react bad to cinnamon. Just some tips :)",

Your hair is wavy so if you wanted to go CG method you could. I put both of these in and the shampoo is approved with caution (meaning some ingredients might not work for everyone but if it works for you keep using it) and the conditioner was not approved based on the inclusion of Isododecane which is not a silicone but it is insoluble in water and can act as one in the sense that it can prevent your hair from getting “real” moisture.\n\nOverall that being the only unapproved ingredient tells me these are probably alright to be using and shouldn’t damage your hair or dry it out. If you notice any product buildup or your roots being more oily than normal you can use a clarifying treatment and if your hair seems like it’s still not getting moisturized from the shaft down you could try getting a deep conditioning mask to do once or twice a week. If all else fails you could just switch to a new shampoo and conditioner after you use these up.",

But i had no time to go to the doctor again.  I also had no idea that ferritin 28 is low back then, cause they didn't marked it with black, and i also used to have super low ferritin in past so i thought 28 is great. From the start of 2022 i am using the same shampoos. 1st hand with a 92% natural ingredient shampoo that is it for hairloss and 2nd hand with a pharmaceutical dandruft shampoo. After that i was keep loosing a lot of hair, even if i started taking folate. But i didn't had a blood panel done. (I have checked thyroid though A LOT of times in my life and never had an issue). I didn't managed to grow my hair really thick after that, some times i was loosing a lot of hair, some others not so much. \n\nI got covid and had 40 fever for 3 days and after exactly 2 months, April of 2023, a CRAZY hairloss started. I was in shock. I also had 34 ferritin though. Hairloss stopped or stopped being so severe in Late August. And gradually my hairloss came to normal. Normal for me is loosing 2-3 hairs after the wash day, and as i go further to the next washing day i loose more hair but nothing serious. After that i managed to make my hair a lot thicker ! Sure though the were 2 areas were they were still not thick. But in general i was happy, cause they looked good. i just wanted to grow them longer.\n\nAnd OUT OF NOWHERE in July i started loosing A LOT of hair.  I checked ferritin and it was 49. Pretty good and better than before. It could be higher but i guess its not so low to cause hairloss. 1 year before doctor had told me that 34 it COULD possible cause hairloss, and in order to exclude it, it should be higher. So 49 cannot be that bad.\n\nI know my body, and i know that in the first days after the washing day i am just loosing 2-3 hair per day, and as i go closer to washing day (day 7) in the last 2 days i see some more hair shedding but nothing crazy. All summer though  was loosing A LOT OF HAIR every day, it was pretty shocking. Even in the first day after washing.  Even some hours after washing. I was shedding a lot.\n\nI run out of the 92% natural shampoo i use on the 1st hand. So i putted some water on it to use it and i saw LESS hairloss but still not normal it was just better. The next week i had run out of it so i only used the other shampoo i have in 2-3 hands cause it does not foam. And my hairloss came back to NORMAL. Exactly after the wash i didn't used it !\n\nI am pretty sure its from the shampoo, it was just a pitty to loose ALL MY PROGRESS and now be on point zero and trying to grow back my hair again. I just wonder how i didn't had hairloss when i was using it on winter and now it caused me hairloss? All this 2,5 years i was using it i never managed to grow my hair really thick and i didn't checked my ferritin regurarly, so i don't know if shampoo also was an issue. It could possible be.\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\n|| || |Aqua (Water), Coco-Glucoside, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Panthenol, Niacinamide, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape\\*) Leaf Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive\\*) Fruit Oil, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow\\*) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Biotin, Tocopherol, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Magnesium PCA, Zinc PCA, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Manganese PCA, Glyceryl Oleate, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Parfum (Fragrance), Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Citric Acid, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate| || ||",

I am instructed to wash with the Rx shampoo twice a week and leave it in for five minutes. But the shampoo is absolutely filled with artificial dyes and a bunch of stuff I can't pronounce, and sulfates. Ingridients are: ketoconazole Inactive ingredients: coconut fatty acid diethanolamide, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, FD&C Red No. 40, hydrochloric acid, imidurea, laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen, PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate, purified water, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, and sodium lauryl ether sulfate.\n\nI really want to use the curly girl method, but I'm worried that this shampoo, being stated my my dermatologist that no other shampoo can be used, will drain my hair. Can I still use the shampoo?\n\nKnowing my hair type would also help. I'm not sure myself. I have always assumed 2c or 2b, but based on my bangs it might be curly, not wavy.

Bạn có thể dùng tẩy da chết vật lý chứa các chứa các hạt scrub siêu nhỏ để khi massage trên da sẽ cuốn theo lớp sừng và da chết đi ra. Hoặc có thể dùng sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết hóa học  có nồng độ axit nhẹ rồi từ từ nâng dần lên, với sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết có BHA nên sử dụng nồng độ 1-2%, sau 1-2 tháng nâng lên 4%, còn với AHA nên sử dụng từ nồng độ 3-5% sau nâng lên 7-10%\n\nBước 4: Đắp mặt nạ đất sét/ than hoạt tính\n\nĐắp mặt nạ đất sét không chỉ giúp làm sạch sâu bên trong lỗ chân lông mà còn giúp loại bỏ dầu thừa, bụi bẩn trên da đem lại hiệu quả trị mụn tốt hơn. Cách thực hiện vô cùng đơn giản, chỉ cần đắp mặt nạ 1 lớp mỏng trên da và giữ trong vòng 15-20 phút sau đó rửa sạch lại bằng nước ấm.\n\nBước 5: Nặn mụn\n\nSau khi đắp mặt nạ khoảng 10 phút, lỗ chân lông đã được làm sạch và mở rộng hơn giúp dễ dàng tiến hành bước nặn mụn. Bạn hãy rửa sạch tay sau đó sử dụng cây nặn mụn đã được khử trùng sau đó dùng lực quét cây nặn mụn nhẹ nhàng trên da để loại bỏ nhân mụn.\n\nBước 6: Đắp mặt nạ phục hồi\n\nSau khi nặn mụn đầu đen, làn da của bạn bị tác động và trở nên nhạy cảm, vì thế bạn cần được đắp mặt nạ để làm dịu da, chống viêm và giảm thâm sau nặn mụn. Có thể sử dụng mặt nạ giấy, mặt nạ sủi bọt, mặt nạ gel,…\n\nBước 7: Sử dụng Toner/ Serum và Kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn da khô, sau khi đã nặn mụn và đắp mặt nạ, bạn có thể tiến hành cả 3 bước dưỡng da tiếp theo: dùng toner, serum và kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn có làn da dầu: Sau khi đắp mặt nạ nên chọn 1 trong 3 bước dưỡng da trên để tạo lớp bảo vệ, giúp da mau lành vết thương sau nặn mụn\n\nƯu tiên các sản phẩm không có hương liệu, không cồn, kết cấu mỏng nhẹ và chứa ít gốc dầu gây bít tắc da\n\nBước 8: Chấm mụn\n\nNếu là người mới bắt đầu sử dụng các sản phẩm chấm mụn, bạn nên sử dụng các dòng sản phẩm có chứa hoạt chất Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% hoặc Adapalene. Sau một khoảng thời gian, khi đã quen với các hoạt chất này có thể đổi sang sử dụng Retinol-A hoặc Teetrea oil. Tuy nhiên, Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% và Adapalene vẫn là 2 hợp chất được các chuyên gia da liễu khuyên nên sử dụng.\n\nBước 9: Dùng kem chống nắng\n\nSau các bước chăm sóc trên đừng quên thoa kem chống nắng trước khi ra ngoài vào ban ngày nhé! Kem chống nắng sẽ giúp bảo vệ làn da, giúp các dưỡng chất được hấp thụ hoàn toàn mà không bị mất đi, đem lại hiệu quả tốt nhất.\n\n# Một Số Lưu Ý Trong Quá Trình Chăm Sóc Da Mụn Đầu Đen, Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nGiữ da luôn sạch và thông thoáng\n\nHạn chế sử dụng những đồ uống có cồn, caffeine và các chất kích thích,…\n\nBỏ các thói quen xấu: sờ tay lên mặt, nặn mụn khi chưa sát trùng tay,…\n\nKiểm soát lượng bã nhờn trên da bằng cách: uống đủ nước, ngủ đủ giấc và dùng giấy thấm dầu thường xuyên\n\nBảo vệ da tránh các tác nhân từ bên ngoài: dùng kem chống nắng, đeo khẩu trang\n\nBổ sung dưỡng chất cho da: Vitamin C, A, B3,..\n\nCó thể đến spa nặn mụn theo chu kì 3 – 7 ngày/ lần\n\n Không lạm dụng các biện pháp lột mụn vì sẽ khiến lỗ chân lông to và dễ tổn thương hơn\n\nTại Sao Da Dầu Thường Gặp Trình Trạng Bị Mụn Và Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nNhững người có làn da dầu, da nhờn thường có lỗ chân lông to hơn những người có làn da khô và da thường. Nguyên nhân là do bã nhờn và dầu trên da quá nhiều khiến bụi bẩn dễ dàng bám dính lại, các chất này có tích tụ trên da khiến lỗ chân lông càng ngày càng nở ra, thậm chí gây nên mụn trứng cá. \n\nHậu quả là, sau khi nặn mụn, vùng da bị kéo dãn đó không hồi phục về hiện trạng ban đầu, lỗ chân lông trở nên to và rõ hơn, hình thành sẹo rỗ.\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Mụn Đầu Đen\n\nDa dầu có tuyến mồ hôi hoạt động cực kỳ mạnh mẽ. Chính vì vậy cũng là nguyên nhân hình thành mụn đầu đen. Cơ chế hình thành mụn đầu đen là do tuyến dầu trên da hoạt động mạnh như không thể thoát ra khỏi bề mặt da do lỗ chân lông bị bít tắc bởi bụi bẩn, tế bào chết hay sản phẩm trang điểm và vi khuẩn. Khi các nốt mụn trong lỗ chân lông tiếp xúc với không khí sẽ bị oxy hóa và nhân mụn chuyển sang màu đen sậm.\n\n**Nguồn bài viết gốc:** [Review 10 Loại Sữa Rửa Mặt Trị Mụn Đầu Đen Cực Kì Hiệu Quả](https://odayreview.com/sua-rua-mat-tri-mun-dau-den/)",

I immediately washed the cream off and last night I used my normal cleanser instead, avoiding my eye area but today I’ve woken up with both eyes swollen, red and itchy. \n\nI’m just wondering if anyone knows what one of these products could have caused this. I know it could be anything but I’ve heard of eyelid dermatitis caused by acrylates so I was thinking maybe it could be the Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer in the eye cream but I’m not sure. \n\nHere are the ingredients\nDermalogica cleansing gel \nWater/Aqua/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Cymbopogon Nardus (Citronella) Oil, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Capryloyl Glycine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Methylpropanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA.\n\nBioderma eye cream \nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Dipropylene Glycol, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Seed Oil, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sucrose Stearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Mannitol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Xylitol, Citric Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Rhamnose, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Fructooligosaccharides.

Regular detergents contain chemicals and brighteners which could cause skin problems to babies such as rashes and allergies. The synthetic fragrances in these detergents can cause breathing problems to your baby such as asthma. Ignorantly, people skip this factor but **baby laundry detergent** is a must considering thing. Instead, use organic detergents that contain natural fragrances and do not contain any harmful chemicals such as bleach and phosphates. These **organic plant-based detergents** are good for their skin as they are liquid base, softener, and scent-free.\n\n# Use Separate Laundry Detergent For Your Baby's Clothes:\n\nYou cannot wash baby clothes with your regular detergent because babies have different skin types. Regular detergents instead of **baby laundry detergent**, leave residues are more likely to irritate the baby’s skin and other problems like rashes, dermatitis, and allergies. Therefore, you must use separate **baby** **laundry detergents** for baby clothes as they are scent-free.\n\nFor this purpose, WBM comes with an elegant **baby laundry detergent** that is pure from dyes, and chemical brighteners that harm your baby’s skin.\n\n# Our Baby Laundry Detergent Is The One That You Need:\n\nWe made it by keeping all the relevant qualities that a mother looks for, in a **laundry detergent** i.e. efficient and protective. Therefore we made our **baby laundry detergent** that complies with the exact needs of your baby skin i.e.\n\nü Scent-free\n\nü Chemical Free\n\nü Phosphate Free\n\nü Bleach Free\n\nOur **baby laundry detergent** comes in a liquid form that requires less water.

Moreover, as our detergent is brightener-free, therefore, it helps in maintaining the fabric color as well. In this way, your baby’s clothes will be as fresh as new every time you wash them. Above all, since the **baby detergent** is scent-free therefore, organic ingredients leave natural essence in the clothes. In this way, our **baby laundry detergent** proved to be your ideal choice.\n\n# We Made It All Naturally :\n\nWhen it comes to baby care products, we ensure extra comfort. Fabric detergents for baby laundry are considered efficient against tough stains however, they have some disadvantages as well for instance\n\nThey cause various skin problems such as,\n\nØ Irritation\n\nØ Dermatitis\n\nØ Allergies\n\nØ Eczema\n\nØ Rosacea\n\nØ Rashes\n\nThey are efficient but not suitable for washing baby clothes. Despite all the care, mothers do ignore these harmful facts and wash their baby’s clothes which ultimately prove harmful.\n\nFor this purpose, we ignore all those chemicals and brighteners that are harmful to baby skin Instead; we have made plant-based organic **baby detergent for laundry** that is pure from harmful substances such as,\n\n·  Phosphates\n\n·  Chlorine\n\n·  Brighteners\n\n·  Phthalates\n\n·  Dyes\n\nDespite the absence of these chemicals in our **baby laundry detergent,** it not only removes tough stains but leaves a naturally pleasing scent as well. Therefore, our detergent is the **best laundry detergent** for you.\n\n**Product’s Ingredients:**\n\nFor your convenience, we’ve enlisted all the ingredients that we use in preparing our **baby laundry detergent.** They are as follows.\n\nØ WATER\n\nØ LAURYL GLUCOSIDE\n\nØ DISODIUM LAURETH SULFOSUCCINATE\n\nØ COCAMIDOPROPYLAMINE OXIDE\n\nØ POTASSIUM COCOATE\n\nØ SODIUM PEG-7 OLIVE OIL CARBOXYLATE\n\nØ PARFUM\n\nØ PROTEASE\n\n# How Are We Different From Others?\n\nYou must be thinking that there are several other brands available in your local grocery store as well then why choose us? Well, you have all the right to purchase anything in the world except those who only beat about the bush. Even the highly reputed brands manipulate their audience several times.

    "body": "I'm fairly sure I have seb-derm or something extremely similar, and have been using the Eucerin urea shampoo to deal with this. It not only helps with my scalp, but my hair gets very soft and clean from it. However, after moving to a different state with harder water, it got a little more oily more often, and I ran out of the shampoo. Since I couldn't find it online for a reasonable price, and my hair was getting steadily worse even oily right after the shower, I tried others.\n\nFirst was a hard water shampoo with helped mildly, then Tsal which helped a bit (applied non-optimally), then Flexitol which seemed to make it worse. I then applied Tsal dry to my hair, sectioning it out, applying it twice more in the shower, letting each application sit for 2-3 minutes. This removed the oily feeling, but it takes a LARGE amount, and a few days later my hair felt dry and a bit tangly. So far I've been doing about the same thing but not applying it dry.\n\nMy question is why does the Eucerin Shampoo help so much when others help very little or take so much product to reach the same effectiveness? I've also used the Sebamed shampoo before, but it's also very hard to find now. Is it just the percentage of Urea, and Eucerin has a very high percentage without noting it anywhere on their website? Other ingredients in Flexitol making the urea less effective? Should I just try using the Eucerin Scalp treatment since this is somewhat easy to get?

Lauric acid is the corresponding fatty acid that is present in many foods, which can be reduced to lauryl alcohol. Sulfosuccinate is the ”acid part” of the ester, which is quite water soluble and gives it a charge of -2 when fully deprotonated, hence the two sodium ions to make the desired salt. \n\nIm not sure but I dont think the lauryl alcohol is only produced from coconut oil (given how ubiquitous it is).

Oh, and those first three ingredients sound an *awful* lot like sodium laureth sulfate, the whole ingredient why I think most people used things like Hanz de Fuko products in the first place.\n\nOk, so the shampoo I can deal with.  I'll just go back to using my old stuff.\n\nHowever, check out some of the new ingredients in Quicksand:\n\nHydrogenated Vegetable Oil, AMP-Acrylates/Allyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Butylene Gycol, Cinnamidoproyltrimonium *Chloride*, Hydrolized Soy Protein, Hydrolized Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein...\n\nAgain, the list goes on and on.  I'm not a chemist, but I'm guessing a lot of those ingredients aren't \"natural\" like they used to be.\n\nHanz de Fuko got bought out is my guess.

After doing some research, I've discovered that many of these products contain chemicals that are neurotoxic, carcinogenic, and reprotoxic.\n\nThe most alarming is the Bath and Shower wash. It's loaded with Benzyl salicylate, an endocrine disrupter; Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, which is carcinogenic; PPG-5-Ceteth-20, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Testrastearate, and PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric glycerides, all linked to neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects; and Salicylic acid, known to be reprotoxic.\n\nKiehl's Ultra Facial Cleanser contains Phenoxyethanol, which is associated with fertility issues, along with PEG-200 Hydrogenated glyceryl palmate, PEG-7 Glycerl cocoate, and Laureth-2 – all flagged as neurotoxic and carcinogenic.\n\nSimilar concerns have been raised about the Body Lotion, which also contains Phenoxyethanol and PEGs, and the Amino Acid Shampoo, containing PPG-5-Ceteth-20, PEG-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, and Phenoxyethanol.\n\nI thought it was crucial to share this with you all, as these are products we might be using regularly without knowing their potential harm. It's important to be informed about what we're putting on our bodies. Stay safe and healthy!\n\n*Note: while it's important to acknowledge that most of these chemicals are present in low levels and pose low risks, as members of one of the country’s most premium gyms, shouldn't we advocate for the highest standards? Organic and natural ingredients minimize any health risks. Why take any risk when better, safer alternatives could be the norm?",

        "body": "To preface, I don't love Khiel's products either and I am not a dermatologist, but I am a skincare junkie and a lot of the ingredients you're mentioning are quite common in the skincare world in moderated amounts!\n\nFor example, [Phenoxyethanol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkPZTKWYeE8&ab_channel=DrDray) is often used as a preservative. There's been a huge push to \"clean beauty\" in the past few years, but a lot of it is just marketing. \"Clean beauty\" products expire a lot quicker and they harbor bacteria.\n\n[Salicylic Acid](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2021-08/sccs_o_223_0.pdf) is a holy grail for a lot of people who struggle with acne, oily skin, and uneven skin tone. If you have ever used any anti-acne product in your life, chances are it had salicylic acid.\n\nThe worst thing that sticks out to me on here is [Benzyl Salicylate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Benzyl-salicylate#section=Antidote-and-Emergency-Treatment) and that's mostly just because it's a fragrance and all fragrances are classified as irritants. Some people tolerate them just fine, but going fragrance-free is the first thing many people with sensitive do when narrowing down their issues.\n\nI know you listed a lot more, but I just wanted to give my 2 cents on some ingredients I was familiar with just because they're common in the skincare world. Again, if you prefer to stay away from chemicals, that is more than fine. But I also wanted to throw my comment out there for those that are now worried they're slowly dying from showering at Equinox haha",
